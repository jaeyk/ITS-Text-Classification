"The Boiling Turkish Pot There is a great deal of fear in Western capitals, including Washington, D.C., that Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's government is continuing to draw closer to the radical Muslim nations, and away from the West. After taking power, he skillfully exploited the weakness of Tansu Ciller, former Prime Minister and now the Foreign Minister of Turkey, caused by her questionable financial dealings and political scandals. In order to avoid parliamentary inquiry, and possible judicial investigation and indictment, she was compelled to form a coalition government. It is an alliance of convenience, rather than a natural partnership which serves both politicians' interests well. Mr. Amos Perlmutter, Editor of The Journal of Strategic Studies, warns of a crisis in Turkey, since Turkey's military is challenging the authority of Erbakan's government, and is trying to dictate certain terms to force the government to change its program. Erbakan is responding by trying to ignore the warning, by slowly infiltrating into universities and the military, by forming strong bastions in the villages and small towns, and by leading a gradual grass-roots revolution. BACKLASH AGAINST RELIGIOUS FUNDAMENTALISM The Western-educated intelligentsia, professionals, especially professionals women, artists, and certain news media, in a counteroffensive, are evoking Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's principles of attacking the fundamentalists, accusing them of exploiting the masses of religious followers for political gain, and thereby pushing the country backward. Mr. Perlmutter advocates, The Clinton administration must give its full support to the Turkish military and warn Erbakan and his supporters that they are treading on very shaky ground. Writing recently in The Washington Post, columnist Lally Weymouth advocates the same, It would do well to send a clear message that the U.S. stands firmly with those who fight for Turkey's secular democracy, even if they happen to be Generals. Turkey is indeed a boiling pot, with Kurdish insurrection in eastern and southern Turkey, militant fundamentalism on the rise, the intervention of the military with coup d'etat a possibility, and the disappointment of centrist forces with the corrupt political elite. All these factors seem to indicate that Turkey is ready to explode. DISGUST WITH POLITICIANS According to sociologists and independent observers, Turkey's average citizens are disgusted with their politicians and political establishments. In the last eight years, 20,000 citizens have been killed as a result of the Kurdish war or murders by death squads. The results have been: (1) the physical elimination of political dissidents, Kurdish activists, journalists and intellectuals; (2) rampant corruption; (3) sixty percent inflation; (4) collaboration of government officials with organized crime, which is guilty of drug trafficking and money laundering, causing dismay and outrage among Turkish citizens. The previously reported car crash on November 24, 1996 on a highway 100 miles southwest of Istanbul first was viewed as nothing more than another accident like those that kill thousands of people on Turkey's rugged roads each year. However, when the identity of victims revealed that one man, Huseyin Kocadag, was a top security officer from the interior ministry, and the second man was a reputed gangster and notorious criminal, Abdullah Catli, who was wanted by the Interpol for drug smuggling and political killings, and a third person was a prominent Turkish politician, Sedat Bucak, member of the Turkish Parliament, elected from the southern Sanli-Urfa Province who survived the crash. The interior ministry first denied any connection between the gangsters and government officials, and released statements that government officials arrested the notorious criminal and were bringing him to Ankara, but the Turkish news media proved otherwise, and the minister of the interior was forced to resign. The news media soon discovered that government officials and organized crime figures were in cahoots. Sedat Bucak himself heads one of the largest and most powerful tribes in the war-torn Kurdish region, and commands a large private army - village guards - against Kurdish insurgents. Additionally, he receives 1.3 million dollars a month from the Turkish government to do the dirty business, and conducts a dirty war against its won citizens, involving killings by death squads of political dissidents, activists, and intelligentsia who are sympathetic to the Kurdish cause. The dirty business includes drug trafficking, money laundering to raise money for political contributions and paying the death squads. These feudal chieftains, clans, and organizations with their private army and hit squads, composed of criminal elements, are reminiscent of the Ottoman Government's organized army of criminals, `Teskilat-i-Mahsusiye,' which was used against Armenian during the deportations, massacres, and the genocide in 1915. Similar organizations are being used today against the Kurds. INEFFECTIVE BYSTANDERS Until now, the West and the US have been standing as bystanders, raising occasional protests against human rights violations in Turkey. Turkey has been presented as a secular and democratic country, and a Western ally. Turkey's human rights violations, and its conduct of declaring war against its own citizens under the pretext of combating terrorism, have largely been ignored by the US. In fact, in the first half of this century, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, the American Commissioner to Istanbul, and later Allen Welsh Dulles (subsequent Director of the Central Intelligence Agency) who was stationed in Istanbul, instructed their agents to oppose recognition of the Armenian genocide (from the book War against the Jews), as there was an intentional cover-up to protect an ally (Turkey). According to Prof. Levon Marashlian, Dulles received a frank evaluation of US policy from someone who was an official or close associate of the Near East Division: If, in negotiating the treaty with Turkey, we leave out all consideration of a purely ethical nature, we must be prepared to take the consequences and Now dealing with the Turks as though nothing has happened, by appearing eager to shake hands with them...without taking into consideration American public opinion, we might lay ourselves open to criticism which will be difficult to answer. Allen Dulles, in his letter to Admiral Bristol on April 22, 1922, stated, While we are willing to intervene actively to protect our commercial interests, at the same time we can do nothing for the Christian minorities. Prof. Marashlian, attending the Congress of Turkish History in Ankara (Turk Tarih Kongresi) in 1994, presented a paper entitled Economic and Moral Influences on US Polices Toward Turkey and the Armenians 1919-1923, in which he heavily criticized US policies shaped by political ineptitude and moral weakness. DOUBLE STANDARD IN U.S. POLICY Since WWII, US policy has been credited with championing democracy, freedom, liberty, human rights, self-determination throughout the world, and opposing authoritarianism, totalitarianism, dictatorship, and human rights violations. These principles have been waived against Turkey until now. If there was criticism, it was muted. Unfortunately, political expediency leads to compromise in codes of ethics, morals and values. While these principles were applied strictly to undermine unfriendly regimes, governments, and countries, the same principles were often ignored in dealing with friendly regimes, countries, or governments, Turkey being one of them. But support for this kind of regimes sometimes backfires, since the ordinary people under these regimes or governments, live under suppression, oppression, human rights violations, and discrimination, and minorities could be the subject of ethnic cleansing, deportation or genocide, as was the case of the Armenians in yesteryears, and is in the case of the Kurds today. Ironically, centrist forces in Turkish society today are giving good lessons to those foreign governments who are showing political expediency and employing double standards, by not confronting the offenders. The centrist forces of Turkey, however, are not only protesting against corrupt politicians and political establishments, but also protesting against the cooperation of organized crime and government officials, and expressing their dismay for political killings by death squads, dirty business, and dirty war. Centrist Turkish forces, which won't share the extreme fundamentalism of the Erbakans, and also are against the rule of generals, are calling for rule of law, the elimination of human rights violations and political killings, and the punishment of organized crime figures and their cohorts, corrupt politicians. Centrist Turkish citizens are daring to say the truth that foreign supporters of Turkey so far have avoided to say in order not to offend the rulers. These prevailing issues have been brought to the attention of our government by Armenian lobbyists, or by private American citizens of Greek, Cypriot, Armenian, Assyrian, or Kurdish extraction. The common response has been that Turkey is our ally, coupled with a shift in focus to the plight of Turkish citizens themselves, people that are subject to abuse, discrimination, oppression, suppression, forceful assimilation, deportation, arbitrary arrest, and political assassination. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal's March 14, 1997 issue, for five weeks now, the Turkish people have been openly protesting the corrupt system by ringing through the streets of Istanbuland other cities, or by opening the windows to whistle, or flash lights, and bash pans and pots every night at 9 o'clock. The groups hold candles on the street corners to beat their drums. According to the WSJ, the commotion began on Feb. 1, 1997, when organizers of the protest began demanding an investigation of a car accident in rural Turkey which revealed dirty doings, the co-operation between the political elite and organized crime, and the use of gangsters, death squads to eliminate political dissidents, activists, human rights advocates, Kurdish rights promoters, journalists, university professors, and anyone considered to be an enemy of the state. WHY YEAR OF SILENCE? Why has our government in Washington, D.C. remained silent for all these years? Do we have to wait until the boiling Turkish pot explodes? Probably the situation in Turkey would have been better today, if all along we had supported human rights, minority rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, individual liberty, and political rights for all, as well as the right to speak one's own language, to preserve one's ethnic and cultural identity without fear, and asked for recognition of the Armenian genocide, so that the same mentality of militarism, chauvinism, racism, nationalism, pan-Turkism, and fundamentalism could have been prevented today. Appeasement has never worked in history, nor does revisionism of history succeed, sooner or later the truth will prevail. The struggle of the Turkish centrist forces can be successful if these principles and rights are promoted and defended. The same is true for the Karabagh Armenians. Their struggle against the same criminal elements is a just one, which has to succeed. We all should applaud the Armenian Foreign Minister's recent statements to the following effect: (1) Azerbaijan has to negotiate directly with the elected representatives of NKR; (2) NKR can't go back to an enclave status and should have territorial links to Armenia; (3) NKR should retain its armed forces, and international guarantees should be given for NKR's security; (4) After the political status of NKR is decided, the perimeter of the security zone around Karabagh should be demilitarized; (5) the relations between NKR and Azerbaijan should be horizontal, and good neighborly relations should be accomplished; and (6) Azerbaijan should have no sovereignty over NKR. Any agreement devoid of these principles will not last; rather, it will cause future confrontations and conflicts. Only a just solution, one which will serve the cause of justice and is grounded in respect for all peoples, can lead to permanent peace. It will be desirable if President Der Bedrosian gives Armen Sarkissian's job to Robert Kocharian, President of NKR, who has proved to be a very effective and able leader, one who moreover is acceptable to both Diaspora Armenians and the Armenians in Armenia. By doing so, the Armenian president will give a signal to our adversaries that NKR and Armenia constitute one entity.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1997-03-22,0
"The `Great Game' in Play in Azerbaijan. During her recent confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright identified the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabagh as a priority of the Clinton foreign policy team. This was most welcome since U.S. involvement in the peaceful settlement of this little-known conflict would enhance America's security interests immeasurably in the volatile, but ever more important, Caucasus region. Unfortunately for Washington, however, it may be too late fully to recover the ground lost during the first four years of the Clinton administration due to its unduly cautious approach toward the Caspian Sea Basin. If the United States is to secure its enduring national security interests there, it must now play catch-up with the traditional powers of the region (notably, Russia and Iran) in the strategic contest long known as the Great Game. Those interests are: the rapid and uninterrupted development of Caspian Sea oil so as to reduce Western dependency on Persian Gulf sources of oil; containment of Iran's Islamic fundamentalism; restraining Russia's lingering expansionist tendencies; creating export opportunities and jobs; and the nurturing of truly independent, pro-Western and democratic states with market-oriented economies. More than any other newly independent state of the region, Azerbaijan has aligned itself with America's interests. Clearly, it deserves our support. Azerbaijan can be critical to U.S. efforts to diversify oil supplies since it is the key to unlocking the estimated 200 billion barrel hydrocarbon reserves of the Caspian Sea region. The initial oil projects signed thus far in Azerbaijan are expected to produce more than 2 million barrels per day - roughly equivalent to what the U.S. imports from OPEC's Arab members. Azerbaijan is also on the front line of America's containment policy toward Iran. Although Azerbaijan is a Shi'ite Muslim nation, its government has striven to maintain a secular character. For example, in the face of intense Iranian pressure, Azerbaijan adopted a constitution in 1996 that calls for a separation of church and state. Furthermore, at Washington's urging, Azerbaijan denied Iran entry into the consortium of countries invited in 1994 to develop its offshore oil resources in the Caspian Sea. In has also firmly resisted Iranian demands that Baku terminate friendly relations with Israel. Azerbaijan is the only former republic of the Soviet Union with no Russian troops on its territory. Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev has refused to cooperate with Russia on border defense, frustrating Moscow's desire to have a unified defense perimeter in the Caucasus. No less than Iran, Russia has viewed with horror the prospect of the U.S. benefiting from access to new oil resources, export opportunities and a strategically situated pro-Western regime. On June 21, 1996, Iran's foreign minister and the deputy speaker of Russia's Duma stated at a joint press conference that Iran and Russia should cooperate with regional states to prevent the presence of [U.S.] power in the Caspian Sea. Largely in deference to Russia, the Clinton administration has thus far hesitated to deepen its close working relationship with the government of Azerbaijan, pursuing instead a policy of episodic engagement with Baku. Regrettably, the cost to American interests of Accommodating Russia in this way has been high. According to industry sources, President Aliyev has, since 1994, signed production-sharing agreements governing the extraction of some 8 billion barrels of oil that could equate to more than $16 billion in service-related work (read jobs). The preponderance of these contracts have gone to European and Japanese companies that have, with the full support of their respective governments, moved aggressively to develop a presence in Azerbaijan. Another factor contributing to America's loss of strategic and economic opportunities in Azerbaijan over the past few years has been discriminatory U.S. legislation, notable Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Thanks to this legislation, Azerbaijan is the only country in the world forbidden by law from receiving direct humanitarian assistance from the United States. Even Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Iran and Iraq - all avowed adversaries of this country - are allowed to obtain U.S. humanitarian assistance. Due to this prohibition, the United States has been unable to provide relief assistance to the refugee population dislocated by the war in Nagorno-Karabagh, many of whom are children. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 44 percent of the Azeri refugee children between the ages of 1 and 5 are at immediate risk from like-threatening disease. Unfortunately, even after Congress in 1995 created some latitude for the president to waive this prohibition and provide humanitarian aid to Azerbaijan, the administration had not acted decisively. The time has come to adopt a more thoughtful and sustainable policy toward Azerbaijan. The occasion this week of a visit to Washington by Ilham Aliyev - first vice president of the Azerbaijani State Oil Co. and son of President Aliyev - affords an excellent opportunity for the Clinton administration to announce the following steps: First, President Clinton should invite President Aliyev to the White House. This would be a signal to both Iran and Russia that the United States recognizes the strategic significance of Azerbaijan and intends to develop a close, long-term relationship between Washington and Baku. Second, the administration should immediately launch a high-level diplomatic initiative to seek an equitable settlement to the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict. In so doing, the U.S. could deny Russia's present pretext for continuing adventurism in region. Once a settlement has been reached, President Clinton should invite the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan to Washington to sign the [pe...] agreement and cement America's cordial relations with both parties. Third, the administration should immediately waive the ban on humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan embodied in Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Even modest sums could have lives of many thousand of beleaguered refugees - and provide a tangible demonstration of America's desire to play a constructive role in the Caspian Sea basin. As Azerbaijan develops into new Kuwait, significantly increasing the stakes of the Great Game, the key question is: Will the United States at last begin to act in a more farsighted and proactive manner so as to position itself to succeed in what promises to be the primary new energy plan of the 21st century?","Sobhani, S Rob",Armenian Reporter International,1997-03-15,0
"The Ankara-Moscow-Tehran Triangle, or Caucasian Quagmire Three major countries, Turkey, Russia and Iran, have been dominant powers in the Transcaucasus and Near East for the last four centuries. Each has been weary of the others' intentions; each has tried to extend its influence and control over the region, and create political dependency, military supremacy, cultural influence and economic control over other states, while trying to project power beyond their national territory. Among the three powers, each has vulnerability in their ethnic compositions, and therefore could be targeted for foreign subversion and interference: Turkey with its Kurdish population in the Kurdish region; Russia with its Turkic populations in BashKortostan, Buryatia, Chechnya, Chuvashia, Dagestan, Gorno-Altay, Inqushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia-Cherkessia, Tataristan, and Yakutia; and Iran with its Turkic population in Iranian Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan-e Gharbi, and Azerbayjan-e Sharqi). All three countries feel insecure about their Turkic minorities, and each one has to track the other's intentions in the interest of national security and territorial integrity. In this volatile and hostile region, old historical territorial disputes, old scores and grudges, imperial ambitions and rivalries are creating a dangerous environment for small nations. Armenia and NKR geographically are in the center of this triangle, where the prospective spheres of influence of Ankara, Moscow and Tehran are overlapping, thus creating opportunities, as well as dangers, for this tiny Armenia and NKR. THE TURKISH CHALLENGE After the demise of the Soviet Empire, Turkey with its 65 million population, feels secure enough to challenge the U.S. and Russia. Turkey, instead of being surrounded by an expansionist empire, finds itself bordered by a plethora of states which are militarily and economically weak. Thus, Turkey's role in the Near East has been significantly enlarged with the breakup of the USSR, and Turkey now wants to project its power and influence from the Balkans to the Chinese Sinkiang Uighur Province inhabited by Turkic nations. Turkey still has to define its sociopolitical position whether it belongs to the East or West. With a mixture of Islamic fundamentalism, chauvinism, militarism, fascism, racism, and imperialism, especially while facing major domestic and ethnic challenges from its 20 million Kurdish population, Turkey is drifting toward authoritarianism. Turkey's most challenging domestic problem is the growth of Kurdish nationalism, though for a long time Turkey denied it had a Kurdish problem. Successive Turkish governments refused to concede the existence of Kurds, and the government banned the use of the Kurdish language, customs, and songs in public places, yet Kurdish nationalism is gaining ground. The bloody war with the Kurds in the southern and eastern regions of Turkey, which has gone on for the past eight years, has changed the Turkish attitude; now the Turks are openly discussing this vital issue publicly and are coming to the serious realization that the Kurdish issue will be around for a long time, and that it is affecting Turkey's relations with the West. Internal strife is causing the rise of Turkish nationalism. With this vacuum created by the demise of Soviet Union, Turkey's foreign policy is increasingly focusing on the Balkans, Middle East, Caucasus, and Central Asia, and is directly challenging the other regional powers, Russia and Iran. Turkey is trying to take advantage of these newly opened political opportunities, and invest in newly opened political opportunities, and invest in newly opened markets which can increase its trade and can serve as a funnel for Western investment. THE VOLATILE CAUCASUS The Caucasus is a region driven today by volatile politics, ethnic strife, territorial disputes, oil politics, and foreign intervention. The three independent states of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan are searching for external allies, while Nagorno-Karabagh, Chechnya, Ossetia, Abkhazia, and Ajaria are trying to shape their own destinies and are asking for independence. Azerbaijan is in open military and political alliance with Turkey, and is trying to use its oil potential to lure Western and U.S. investments; in turn, Azerbaijan is hoping for the political backing of the U.S. and the West, in order to subdue the Armenians and to restore Azeri rule in NKR. Georgia is pursuing its traditional mercurial foreign policy, which is subject to daily dances, depending on what kinds of offers and promises they receive from the major power players of the region. Sometimes the Georgians tilt towards the Turks, other times the Russians, and still other times the Americans, giving lip service to Georgian-Armenian friendship while openly courting and backing Azerbaijan for oil. Meanwhile, they are struggling to keep Georgia unified as the Ossetians, Abkhazians, and Ajarians challenge Tbilisi's authority. Armenia and NKR are consistently moving to the conclusion that Russia is no longer a reliable protector against the Turkish threat which is real, since Turkey made agreements with Azerbaijan to supply military equipment and training, and tightened its relations with Baku. Members of the Defense Committee of Russia's Communist-controlled State Duma proposed a draft resolution which would remove Russian military bases from Armenia and Georgia; this created shock waves in Armenia's defense establishments, exposing Russia's weakness, lack of foreign policy direction and cohesiveness. Russia is in a political, economic and military decline, facing increasing demands from its Turkic populace, and regions, for more local political autonomy, self-rule, and economic control. These minorities are challenging the central authorities in Moscow. TURCO-RUSSIAN COLLUSION Turkey, although sympathetic to the pleas of Russia's Turkic minorities for independence, at the present moment is not pledging any direct assistance as long as the Russians pursue a hands-off policy in the ongoing Kurdish separatist movement in Turkey. How long this political collusion sustains a gentlemen's agreements between these two adversaries and rivals will depend on the political stability in Ankara and Moscow. Any sign of weakness may alter the present balance of power, as well as the gentlemen's agreement, leading to open subversion and interference in the internal affairs of one another, and creating an open confrontation and military conflict. This will alter the regional balance of power and alignment. The use of tactical nuclear weapons and larger military force could become a possibility, threatening the region's smaller states. Georgia, Armenia, NKR, and Azerbaijan will probably become the battleground for invading armies. In this scenario Turkey will invade Armenia and Nakhichevan and Armenia to halt the Turkish offensive. Probably, with the Kurdish uprising in eastern and southern Turkey, and a Turkish uprising in Russia, both Turkey and Russia will be denied victory. Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan will be devastated. The new conflicts over the Balkans, Greco-Turkish borders, Greek-Turkish separation lines in Cyprus, Syrian-Turkish, and Iraqi-Turkish, borders may trigger Israeli intervention. War may engulf the entire Middle East, and China may even intervene by invading the Central Asian Turkic Republics of Kazakhistan, Uzbekistan, Turkistan, and Kirghizistan, weary of a potential Turkic uprising in its own Sinkiang Uighur province. India may invade Pakistan and Kashmir to counter the Chinese move, and world peace will be threaten, leading to WW III. OIL POLITICS The U.S. and the West have to realize that oil politics is a serious issue, which is threatening the economic interests of Russia and Iran, and is altering the political and military balance of power. Oil politics has serious implications for the triangular relations among Ankara, Moscow, and Tehran, each having its internal difficulties, ethnic strife, and economic problems, each open to subversion and violent political upheavals, which will not serve regional and world peace very well, with grave consequences to mankind. The U.S. is the only power that can prevent this disaster from happening. The State Department needs to reconsider its relations with Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iran. It needs to declare that the U.S. is against Pan-Turkism, Fundamentalism, Authoritarianism, Militarism, Expansionism, and Racism, and it is for Democracy, Self-Determination, and the Rights of Minorities. The U.S. should take the initiative to persuade Russia to grant independence to Chechnya, to convince Azerbaijan to recognize NKR's independence, ask Georgia to accept the sovereignty of Abkhazia and Ossetia sovereignty, demand that Turkey grant full autonomy to its Kurdish populace, and seek an open dialogue with Iran to establish diplomatic relations, so that Iran can play a constructive role. Addressing these real issues which stem from historical grievances and injustices will bring tranquility, stability and peace, will promote economic cooperation, and will lead to lasting peace. Any efforts to maintain the status quo or to encourage Pan-Turkism and Turkish expansionism, or to undermine the influence of Russia and Iran in the Ankara-Moscow-Tehran triangle will be counterproductive and will lead to confrontations as described above, which is not farfetched. All major wars are the consequence of miscalculations, and are due to alterations in the balance of power, caused by disruption of military balance. These alterations and disruptions are changing the essence of geopolitics, which will take control of energy sources and transportation routes. This is exactly what is happening now in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia, causing major worries in Moscow, Tehran and Perking with each having its own reasons, which is Pan-Turkic, and Pan-Turkist unity, and expansionism.

"Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan of Istanbul Corrects Human Rights Report on. Turkey by US State Dept. ISTANBUL, Turkey - Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, chairman of the Religious Council of the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul, commenting on the Turkey Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1996 released last week by the U.S. State Department Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, told a foreign reporter that the US State Department report needs some corrections and deliberations. It is true, commented the Archbishop, that the `Refah-Yol' Government formed in July has sought a more cooperative relationship with religious minorities, particularly in Istanbul. The state directorate (Vakiflar Genel Mudurlugu) responsible for the religious minority trusts gave the Armenian community permission to renovate several churches in Istanbul and one historic church in Kayseri (Central Anatolia) and to make fundamental reparations on a village chapel in Antakya. The requests of the respective parish councils for the renovations of these churches were all approved without much delay. The Archbishop added that some churches and religious buildings are in danger of either mismanagement or neglect, only because prevailing practices prohibit church members from being elected to the parish councils of churches outside their areas of residence. Archbishop Mutafyan said that the Armenian Patriarchate has not reported to the local Armenian press in 1996 any incidents of harassment against Armenian churches in Istanbul. His Grace added that he himself is the Armenian Exarch of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara and that his community has not had any complaints with regards to growing encroachment by any Muslim extremist groups on lands belonging to Armenian individuals. There have been minor cases of social harassment caused by extremist Turkish nationalist youths, but the police department has responded speedily with intensified security measures. He reported that inter-faith dialogue efforts between Christians, especially Armenians, and the Muslims developed in 1996. Armenians do not fear rising Islamic radicalism; on the contrary, they would welcome a more just, clean, traditional and faithful society; after all, Turkey is a 99% Muslim country.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1997-02-15,0
"Common Declaration of Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Aram I. ANTELIAS, Lebanon - At the conclusion of their recent meeting at the Vatican, His Holiness Pope John Paul II, leader of the Roman Catholic Church, and His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the See of Cilicia, issued a joint statement, the text of which follows: As their official meeting draws to its conclusion, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of Cilicia, give thanks to God who has allowed them to deepen their spiritual fraternity in Jesus Christ and their pastoral and evangelical vocation in the world. The meeting has offered a privileged opportunity to pray and reflect together, and to renew their commitment and common efforts for the unity of Christians. The meeting between the Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia and the Pope of the Catholic Church marks an important milestone in their relations. This relationship, which dates to the very beginnings of Christianity in Armenia, assumed a particular importance in Cilicia from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries, and has continued after the Catholicosate of Sis was exiled from its see and established in Antelias, in Lebanon, in 1930. Pope John Paul II and Catholicos Aram I rejoice that their meeting coincides with the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, which highlights the urgency of full communion amongst Christians, so that they may fulfil their fundamental mission, which is their giving testimony to Christ, who died and was resurrected for the salvation of humanity. Throughout two millennia, the unity of faith in Jesus Christ, gift of God, has been in its essential nature maintained, despite christological and ecclesiological controversies whose origins can be traced to historic[al], political and socio-cultural factors. This communion of faith, which has been affirmed over the last decades at the meetings of their predecessors, was recently and solemnly reaffirmed in the meeting of His Holiness Pope John Paul II with His Holiness Catholicos Karekin I. In the same way today the Bishop of Rome, the successor of Peter, and the Catholicos of Cilicia pray together for the deepending of the communion of faith in Jesus Christ, made possible by the blood of the martyrs and the fidelity of the Fathers to the Gospel and to the Apostolic Tradition, manifesting itself in the diversity of their respective ecclesial traditions. Such communion in faith must translate itself concretely in the life of the faithful and it must guide us towards full communion. The two spiritual leaders therefore highlight the vital importance of sincere dialogue under taken in the theological and pastoral domains, as well as in other dimensions of the life and witness of the faithful. The existing relations strongly favor direct and fruitful collaboration between them. His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Holiness Aram I are firmly convinced that, in this century in which the Christian communities have been more profoundly engaged in the ecumenical dialogue, a genuine rapprochement, sustained by reciprocal respect and understanding, constitutes the only sure and viable way leading to full communion. The Catholic Church and the Catholicosate of Cilicia have before them a broad range of possibilities for constructive collaboration. Due to ideologies expressed in materialistic values and the disastrous effects of injustice and violence, the world today poses a profound threat to the integrity and identity of the Christian faith. More than ever before, the Church of Christ must, by its fidelity to the Gospel, give the world a message of hope and charity, and become the fervent messenger of evangelical values. Active collaboration should also be sought in the fields of the study and the teaching of theology, in religious education, in the appraisal of pastoral situations where common action is possible, and in the promotion of ethical values; similarly, it is imperative to search for ways to confront the many difficulties related to the mission and to the pastoral and spiritual engagement for the renewal of Christian life and the transformation of society. The Pope and the Catholicos urge their clergy and faithful to participate actively in these efforts which should take concrete form at all levels, and particularly at the local level where the faithful are together confronted by difficult situations. The Christian faith also urges the faithful to more effective collaboration to promote the dignity and rights of every human being, as well as the rights of all peoples to the recognition of their legitimate aspirations and cultural identities. The Armenian Church today confronts situations and challenges which call for it to give more effective testimony in Armenia, in Nagorno-Karabagh, and in the diaspora. Dispersed throughout the world, the faithful of this Church live in contexts in which dialogue is crucial for its life and its witness. In today's pluralist societies, characterized by exchanges, in which cultures, religions and civilizations are constantly in interrelation and interaction, the Churches have the important task of promoting dialogue. The Middle-East context presents a source of mutual enrichment and common witness for Christians who, together with their Muslim compatriots, share in large measure the same history, the same social and economic problems, and the same political destiny. Moreover, the Churches are convinced of the importance of dialogue with the Muslims, and this presents one aspect which calls for cooperation between them. Within this context, the dialogue cannot remain only intellectual and theoretical, but must also touch in a concrete way the very essentials of daily life. The active presence and dynamic testimony of Christians assumes an important role in the Middle East, as they are committed together in the struggle for justice and peace. It is therefore imperative that in the Middle East the spiritual and social mission of the Churches is revitalized. The establishment of a just, comprehensive and durable peace, as well as the just and satisfactory resolution of the problem of the holy city of Jerusalem are the priorities. Lebanon, where the Catholic Church and the Catholicosate of Cilicia have a historical and tangible presence, provides a special setting in which to exercise their mission. In their efforts for the reconciliation and reconstruction of their country, the Lebanese should not marginalize the moral and religious values which constitute the basis of identity of the larger Lebanese family. They should also work so that their country rediscovers fully its identity based on freedom and pluralism, its unity, its sovereignty and its specific vocation in the region and in the world. At the end of the second Christian millenium and the approach of the 17th century of the Armenian Church, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and His Holiness Aram I thank and glorify once again the Holy Trinity who gives them the spiritual power to remain firmly attached to the imperatives of the Apostolic faith and to their pastoral mission. They exhort their clergy and their faithful to work ardently because of the love, the reconciliation, and the justice and peace that the Gospel demands while waiting for the coming of the Kingdom of God.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1997-02-08,0

He tells his friend, Sherms, he is going to bring a gun to school to stop Reebo from tormenting him. When he does, Sherms and he are accidentally shot. When Sherms' brother Lee is released from jail, and the boys recover, they vow to be straight and keep away from drugs and guns.

The full color pages and text illustrate the fearful issues that exist for our children in many schools today. HIS HOLINESS, John Paul II and the Hidden History Of Our Time Carl Bernstein and Marco Politi. Photos, sources, bibliography, index. Doubleday, 1996; 582 pgs. $27.50. When it seems there is nothing new to reveal about Pope John Paul II, out comes a book claiming the Pope and President Reagan conspired to bring down Communism in Poland and the Berlin wall in Germany. Politi and Bernstein present a wonderfully researched book with startling revelations. These revelations may be more inflated than realistic, however. Using John Paul's name is like hitting a bonanza in the publishing field these days. His own 1994 book, Crossing the Threshold of Hope, gave birth to A Reader's Companion on Crossing the Threshold of Hope. Numerous books have been written about John Paul in the past, and the coming year promises more. The hook in His Holiness concerns the US and Vatican connections that are credited with bringing down Communism. With Bernstein's sleuthing in the US government and Politi's long history as a Vatican correspondent, a fascinating book evolved. The book begins with John Paul's early life, the war years experiences, and family loss. The 18 years as pontiff are fully covered-his travels, health, encyclicals and Vatican bureaucracy. His indestructible faith and strong connections with his beloved Poland have influenced many of his decisions. The authors call him the last of the giants on the world stage. The majority of the book examines the connections with CIA Director William Casey, President Reagan and others in bringing down communism. (They provide 25 pages of sources and notes.) It ends with the Pope's bitter disappointment in realizing the world is not following his teachings on moral issues and spreading materialism in the world. THE COMPLETE BOOK OF SCRIPTWRITING by J. Michael Straczynski 424 pgs. Writer's Digest Books, 1996. $21.99 As a writing reference for scriptwriters, this book covers it all. It is an all-in-one guide to creating and selling screenplays, teleplays, theatrical plays, radio scripts and animation scripts. Straczynski, who is a contributing editor for the Writers Digest magazine, also is successful in the TV field, serving as writer/producer of Murder She Wrote, The New Twilight Zone and others. Chapters are thorough, with a brief history of the department before delving into its pitfalls and competition and contract signing. Formatting telescripts and set requirements are all part of the craft of screenwriting, much different than magazine articles or novels. How to define acts, create dialogue, develop ideas, prepare query letters, sample scripts and client-agent contracts are all discussed in depth. This book will certainly be a well thumbed bible to aspiring screenwriters. A READER'S COMPANION to Crossing the Threshold of Hope; edited by Charla Honea Paraclete Press, 232 pgs. The goal of this book is to provide the reader with a dialogue on Pope John Paul's thoughts and belifefs. Sixteen visionary thinkers respond to various sections of Crossing the Threshold of Hope. A sampling of chapters includes How Does the Pope Pray?; Is Jesus the Son of God?; Why So Many Religions?; Judaism; What is the Use of Believing?, Women and others. The essays by theologians -- Episcopal, Mennonite, Methodist, Jewish, Baptist, United Church of Christ --as well as writers, publishers, T.V. hosts and professors, offer another view on the Pope's writing. All are deeply moved by the Pope's thoughts, how it affects every person, and what we, as a world community, are able to do about it. Chapters include Emil Castro, past General Secretary of the World Council of Churches, responding to John Paul's desire to proceed on the path of Christian unity. Robert Schuller writes on Through Our Belief God Transforms the World, Yechiel Eckstein provides a Jewish Response. Lynn M. Deming wrote about A New Theology of Women. This inspirational book, like a Bible Commentary, is thought-provoking and encourages the reader to reflect on his/her own actions. POTIONS TO PULSARS Women Doing Science by Sue Bursztynski.

"Professional Group Protests Conversion of Armenian Church in Turkey into. Mosque; Requests UNESCO's Intervention GLENDALE, CA - The Armenian Engineers and Scientists of America, Inc., a professional Armenian group, concerned over the news that Turkey is in the process of converting a significant Armenian church into a mosque, sent the following protest letter, dated January 25, 1997, to Mr. Fedriko Mayor, Director General of UNESCO, based in Paris, France. Text of the letter is published below for its interest to readers: Dear Mr. Mayor: It has recently come to our attention from the Turkish press that a historically and culturally significant Armenian church is targeted to be converted into a mosque. The church is located in the village of Yakoutieh, within the Erzurum region of Turkey. This action was ordered by the Mayor of Erzurum, Mr. Zouheddin Aksaki. Our organization, the Armenian Engineers and Scientists of America (AESA), is vehemently opposed to the planned conversion and asks for your intervention in this matter. As an organization involved in the preservation of historically and culturally significant monuments worldwide, UNESCO must recognize that the planned conversion will result in the loss of this historically significant church. The Turkish government has converted numerous Armenian and other Christian churches into mosques. These conversions result in irreversible changes and render the historical and cultural values of the monuments to a point of insignificance. In one case, a conversion had resulted in painting over church murals. These murals are a rare phenomenon in ancient Armenian churches. We understand the need for mosques to serve the spiritual needs of the local Muslim population. However, there are a number of alternatives available that will provide for a mosque but preserve the ancient churches. The absence of an Armenian population in Yakoutieh and in the region of Erzurum (due to the events of 1915) should not be used as an excuse to convert an ancient church to a mosque. The remaining churches in historical Armenia need to be preserved not only because they are important to Armenians but because they possess rich historical, architectural and cultural values. These monuments offer great cultural values that are recognized as being significant and worthy of protection and preservation by the international community. Preservation of the ancient churches also benefits the Turkish government and its people through increased tourism. Unaltered ancient monuments are great treasures for any country because they attract tourists, which in turn helps the economies of those countries. Turkey recognizes the value in protecting and preserving ancient churches as evidenced by initiative #60 (approved June 10, 1997, by the Turkish Monuments Preservation Council), which guarantees the preservation of ancient churches due to the historical value they possess. Obviously the proposal by Mayor Aksaki of Erzurum is in violation of the approved initiative. AESA urges UNESCO to act promptly in this manner. The world cannot afford to lose one more cultural monument. Our organization is eager to offer its assistance in this urgent matter.

"Political Incompetence of Armenians is Endangering Karabagh's Future. BY MURAT ACEMOGLU, M.D. Political science is most generally understood to mean the systematic study of the governmental process by the application of scientific methods of analysis and scholarly studies of international relations, with the emergence of academic discipline in law, sociology, history, geography, ethnic-religious relations, economy, geopolitics, and psychology, in order to find better, less dangerous, and more effective means of relations among peoples, societies, governments, and economies. The secret of success in Turkey's foreign policy is due to the existence of the University of Political Science in Ankara University. The fully trained cadres of world-class Turkish diplomats are pursuing an effective foreign policy. For example, Turkey's Defense Minister Turhan Tayan is threatening to destroy the Russian surface-to-air S-300 missiles as soon as they reach Cyprus, within sixteen months' time. Related to this policy, Turkey's Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller Hanim recently stated in Moscow that Turkey will not let NATO threaten Russia, adding Ankara could hold up NATO expansion into Eastern Europe, and to accept new members into its organization, until an amicable agreement is reached with Russia. This is indeed a brilliant effective political coup for the Turkish Foreign Minister. At the same time, she is putting the U.S. and the West on short notice, saying that Turkey has the veto power and the ability to stop NATO's expansion to the East; at the same time, by this gesture, Turkey is trying to lure Russia into cooperation, not to go ahead with missile deals, while forcing the U.S. and the West to persuade Greece and Cyprus to cancel the missile deal. In the final analysis, Turkey will be able to maintain its control over Northern Cyprus (Turkish sector), to influence the Greek Cypriot government's future decisions and its relations with other states (hegemony), and to eliminate Russia's presence in its southern borders, since installation of S-300 missiles requires the presence of Russian military instructors. Moreover, they are presenting this danger to the U.S. in a fine diplomatic way. In the end, no matter which way the missile deal goes, Turkey will be the winner. AMATEUR STANDING Now let's take a look at the amateur standing of Armenia's Foreign Ministry and of the ARF Bureau's leadership in foreign policy issues. Armenia's Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Vartan Oskanian urges trilateral unity among Armenia, Nagorno-Karabagh, and the Diaspora to create favorable resolution of the Karabagh conflict. This is an urgent appeal, and we all have to answer his call for the sake of the security and independence of Armenia and Karabagh. Mr. Voskanian stated, We've had a historic opportunity to have control over Nagorno-Karabagh, but things are getting tough; it will be difficult next year to maintain this diplomatically. Amazingly, he expressed surprise that without any notice, during the Lisbon conference closing ceremonies, very abruptly, 53 heads of state [including the US, Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Greece, Vatican, and Cyprus --M.A.] said directly, openly and collectively that Nagorno-Karabagh should remain part of Azerbaijan.... Surprise? This statement of surprise reveals that Armenia's foreign policy is run by amateurs, who lack direction, coordination and policy making, as well as adequate information to assess the other states' position. They also lack the initiative to persuade foreign governments with properly prepared presentation of the historical, legal, and political rights of Armenia and Karabagh within politically correct perspectives. MAIN KARABAGH ISSUES The issues that should have been presented to foreign governments are the following: The Nagorno-Karabagh Autonomous Republic (NKAR), even during the Soviet era, was supposedly to run its own affairs under the Soviet Constitution. However, this autonomous status was arbitrarily and illegally canceled by the newly independent Azerbaijan Republic, and the disputed territory was annexed to Azerbaijan in violation of existing agreements. The Azeri government declared a war against own citizens (Armenians) in NKAR: It organized pogroms against the Armenian civilian population in Sumgait, Baku, and Kirovabad (Ghanja); bombarded the civilian population in Stepanakert; deported the Armenians from Shahumian, Mardakert, and Ardzuashen. All these actions proved its criminal intention to eliminate the indigenous population of the Nagorno-Karabagh Republic (NKR). The past 70 years of misrule by Azerbaijan in NKR deprived the Armenian population of their basic human rights. Cultural oppression, banning of the teaching of Armenian history and language, and the intentional destruction of Armenian monuments is enough evidence that Azerbaijan wanted to annex NKR a long time ago. Furthermore, the demise of the Soviet Union created this opportunity for the Azeri rulers, endangering the safety of Armenians as well as Armenia's security. The Armenian population of NKR has always been, and still remains, entitled to the undeniable rights of self-defense and self-determination. These strong statements are based on facts and realities; through them, putting pressure on foreign governments to accept these realities is the responsibility of Armenia's Foreign Ministry. A GRAVE POLICY MISTAKE The ARF Bureau also made a grave policy mistake which is endangering the security and well-being of the young Republic of Armenia and Karabagh. Criticism of human rights violations, perceived election irregularities, and violation of democracy in Armenia, as well as in the Diaspora, is proper. Indeed, it is the responsibility of every Armenian to get involved, as long as this criticism is constructive, aimed at improving the social conditions, rule of law, and internal tranquility of Armenia and NKR. Unfortunately, most of the criticisms leveled by the ARF Bureau are not based on this concept; rather, there are ulterior motives behind them: to score propaganda; to undermine the authority of the Armenian government; to ruin its prestige abroad; and to pave the way for the establishment of ARF power in Armenia. If discussions are conducted in a civil and constructive manner within family, among the Armenians, no one will object. However, exerting pressure on foreign governments, including members of the European Union, U.S., and Russia, to denounce what are perceived to be the Armenian government's violations of democratic principles, is deplorable on the part of the ARF Bureau, and should be condemned. By acting in this manner, the ARF is becoming a tool for the furtherance of foreign governments' aims in terms of undermining the strength of Armenia's government, forcing early elections, and creating instability in Armenia, thus forcing Armenia to make concessions in the Karabagh dispute to accept Azerbaijan's territorial integrity. The ARF allegation that the current Armenian government's violation of democratic principles is endangering Karabagh's quest for independence is hogwash. THE ARF AND CLINTON During the presidential election campaign in the U.S. this past fall, the ARF was bragging that they have excellent relations with President Clinton's White House, and they were soliciting the Armenian vote in favor of the President. Now the Clinton Administration is coming out in favor of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, exerting pressure on Armenia for early elections to weaken the country further so Armenia's government will make concessions; supporting the oil lobby's efforts to make Azerbaijan a centerpiece of American foreign policy in the Caucasus. The ARF's power ambition is forcing independent Armenians to study their past conduct carefully, including their role in the internal strife which engulfed Lebanon in the late 1950's when thousands of Armenians became victims of intercommunal fights, the reputations of honest people were ruined, and the community and church were split permanently. The repercussions of these events still continue today in the Diaspora. The ARF had a glorious history between 1891-1911, when its founding fathers were fighting for the improvement of human rights, administrative reforms for Ottoman subjects and the establishment of constitutional democracy in the Ottoman Empire. The ARF failed miserably when they collaborated with the Young Turks, including Talat Pasha, Enver Pasha, Djemal Pasha, Dr. Mehmed Nazim, and Dr. Behaeddin Sakir -- the future authors of the Armenian Genocide. The ARF failed to provide safety and security for helpless Armenians during the fateful years of 1915-1918. The ARF failed to maintain the First Republic's independence, giving up Kars, Ardahan, and Surmalu without a shot, and then signing the humiliating treaty of Gumru (Gumri) with the Turks on Dec. 3, 1920 despite their not having had the authority to do so, since Soviet power had already been established in Armenia on November 29, 1920. A LOOK BACK AT ARF ACTIVITY Between 1920-1991 their main activity has remained controversial. Good work was done for the preservation of Armenian national awareness, Armenian National Cause, and recognition of the Armenian Genocide. However, the ARF was not the only organization to pursue this agenda; other Armenian organizations did so too. However, relations between Armenian organizations and political parties remained tense, and no attempt was made to coordinate their work to achieve common goals. After W.W.II, when attempts were made to recover Kars and Ardahan from Turkish rule and to restore illegally occupied Armenian lands to Soviet Armenia, as demanded in 1946 by the Soviet government, the Diaspora political organizations, especially the ARF, did not have any agenda to influence such a course. To sway the U.S. State Department towards a decision to restore justice in Armenian-Turkish disputes, on March 12, 1947, President Truman proposed to Congress a program to provide Turkey with military and economic assistance to help and protect Turkey from the Soviets. Instead of pursuing a flexible, fine, and creative policy to defend Armenia's rights, the ARF was too busy leading the anti-Soviet crusade; later they sometimes became pro-Soviet, sometimes pro-Turkey, and sometimes pro-West. Ever effort was made as long as everything remained pro-ARF. The continuation of this policy of everything revolving around the ARF is still in effect in today's decision makings. LINGERING CONTROVERSY Since the establishment of the second Republic of Armenia on Sept. 23, 1991, the ARF activities abroad remain controversial. It is fair to say that if the ARF activities are properly channeled for nation building, void of propaganda but based on substance, they could be an asset, since the establishment of a credible opposition is a must in every democratic society to balance the government's acts, as we witnessed in the recent election irregularities, violations of democratic principles, economic crimes, and instances of corruption that occurred in our homeland. For this to happen, the ARF has to act with more responsibility and maturity, devoid of any ambitions, political opportunism, and propaganda ploy, but not just for the sake of attaining power. In the past, the Armenian nation failed miserably because of a lack of prudence, political maturity and experience, lack of cohesion, as well as a lack of political leadership, disunity, infighting, tendency to become a foreign tool, too much faith in others, and too many expectations that foreigners are capable of solving our problems, lack of self-esteem, and self-confidence. Something is lacking in our genes that other nations have, nations that never lost their independence and defeated every enemy, challenging their sovereignty. Blaming geopolitics, geography, hostile powers, and international politics is just an excuse; it is about time to recognize our shortcomings and the reasons why we are failing. ARMENIA CHARACTERIZED In the Area Handbook Series: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, Country Studies published by the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. in 1995, and commissioned by Headquarters, Department of the Army, the information book in the section on Armenia describes the latter as follows: As a nation, Armenia has not had a great tradition of military success, even at the largest extent of the Armenian Empire [the Empire of Tigran the Great, 65 BC --M.A.]...A small country, Armenia has had unfavorable geopolitical situation, with no neighbors likely to provide support and security...Lacking an outlet to the sea, Armenia is surrounded by Muslim Turkey and Azerbaijan, both of which generally have been hostile to Armenia's interests. In early 1990, the major threat to Armenia came from Azerbaijan, a state with twice the population of Armenia, with significant uncovered oil reserves in the Caspian Sea, and with great potential for securing Western capital for industrial developments. The Armenian Army combat success in the conflict in 1992-93 attributed to the political instability in Baku, to regional division within Azerbaijan, and to the great unity and determination of the NKR armed forces...Traditional Turkish nationalism demanded alliance with Muslim Azerbaijan, and eastern Turkey remained a heavily fortified area after the end of the Cold War -- about 50,000 Turkish troops were on the Armenian border in early 1994. In turn, Armenia saw its collective security treaty with the CIS and the presence of Russian troops in Armenia as restraints on the nationalist impulse in Turkish policy making. All these points are statements of fact, with which some will agree, while others will disagree. No matter what, however, the realities speak for themselves. It is about time to sober up before Armenia and NKR are forced to fix their signature on an agreement to surrender Karabagh to the Turkic world. There is no room for futile arguments, explanations, self-deception, and stupid reasoning; it is time to be politically mature to play the game the Turks and Azeris are playing so well, for nothing less than the future of Armenia and that of NKR are at stake. Retrospectively, it is easy to criticize the ARF's leadership for their mistakes in 1912-18, 1918-20, 1946-1989, but if we all fail in Karabagh in 1997, the next generation will ask the question, If our predecessors were going to surrender Karabagh in the end, what was the reason then to ruin the country's economy, to open the doors for the emigration of 1.2 million Armenians from Armenia, to cause 10,000 dead, war casualties and destruction, and create disputes in Zangezur as to whether the Armenians or the Azeris own the southern section of Armenia. In order to prevent these untoward developments from occurring, the ANM, ARF, ADL, partisans or non-partisans, believers or non-believers, we all have to work together, if any sense of responsibility is left in our consciousness.

"Gorbachev, Former Soviet Leader, Discusses Karabagh in his Memoirs. Mikhail Gorbachev. Memoirs. New York and London: Doubleday, 1996; 769 pp. THE KARABAGH EXPLOSION (pp. 333-340) In February 1988 the population of the Nagorno-Karabagh autonomous oblast (which was 85-percent Armenian) of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic demanded that it be made a part of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic. A resolution was passed by the oblast Soviet and immediately supported by thousands of people at demonstrations and meetings in Armenia. These demonstrations were carried out in an organized way, without excesses. The marches carried large posters supporting perestroika and glasnost. Law-enforcement agencies only maintained order, without taking stronger measures anyway, there was little they could have done against this sea of people. This produced a sharp response in Azerbaijan, where mass meetings were likewise held, this time directed against Armenia. In February the Politburo examined the Nagorno-Karabagh question. We received information about the position of the leaders of the republics. The Azerbaijan leader, [Kiamran] Bagirov, insisted that Moscow should guarantee the unchanged status of Nagorno-Karabagh. The Armenian leader, [Garen] Demirdjian [sic], suggested that the appeal of the Nagorno-Karabagh oblast Soviet should be considered in the Supreme Soviets of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the Soviet Union. It became clear that the arguments between Baku and Yerevan over Stepanakert would have to be resolved by Moscow. [Nikolai] Ryzhkov said that we must `act in accordance with the Constitution.' [Vikyor] Chebrikov reported that these events were having a bad effect in other republics. In Estonia there was a growing sentiment in favor of leaving the Union. Tajikistan was debating its claim to Bukhara and Samarkand. I believed that the problem had to be resolved by political means, that the Central Committee should declare any change of borders unacceptable, and that we needed to draft economic, social and cultural proposals aimed at improving the situation in Nagorno-Karabagh. We should let the Armenians and Azerbaijanis get together and decide the status of NagornoKarabagh for themselves, and we ought to accept any decision they made. I felt that the Russian intelligentsia and workers should join in their discussions. We decided to send Politburo representatives to both republics to lend assistance to the local leadership. [Yegor] Ligachev and [Georgy] Razumovsky flew to Baku, and [Aleksandr] Yakovlev and [Vladimir] Dolgikh to Yerevan. Their mission was to establish contacts and reassure the people in those republics. On 26 February I appealed to the peoples of Azerbaijan and Armenia, asking them to show understanding, responsibility and prudence. I said that we would not sidestep frank discussions of various proposals, but that this must be done calmly, within the framework of the democratic process and legality. My speech contributed to some normalization. The continuous mass meetings in Yerevan stopped, and reassured people returned to their homes. I tried to get a dialogue going and explore ways of finding a compromise, which I was firmly convinced was the only way out of the situation. The dispute over Karabagh goes into the distant past. From time immemorial two peoples have lived side by side on this fertile land. It passed from hand to hand; for centuries it was part of Persia. But mainly it was populated by Armenians. Immediately after the [Bolshevik] revolution their ancient dream of reunification with the motherland almost came true. However, although the Azerbaijani leader of that time, Nariman Narimanov, initially gave his consent to this, he soon rescinded it. Afterwards, the question was raised many times, including after the war, but was never resolved. The result was that almost 500,000 Armenians lived in Azerbaijan, mainly in Karabagh, while 200,000 Azerbaijanis lived in Armenia. First of all, we had to address practical problems. Soon after the unrest started, a resolution was adopted to provide assistance to Nagorno-Karabagh, calling for 400 million rubles to be allotted for emergency needs there. Initially, this made a strong impression, but after two or three months, we began to receive indications that the authorities in Azerbaijan were distributing the monies from the center according to their own wishes, with only a small part reaching the intended recipients. We had to send commissions to verify these assertions. It appeared, however, that most of the needs of the local people had indeed been met. If this had been done ten years earlier, if [Heidar] Aliyev had conducted a valid internationalist policy, a catastrophe could have been prevented. By 1988 it was already too late. Events snowballed. Acts of violence broke out the peak being the bloody pogrom of 27-29 February against Armenians in Sumgait, where there was a large number of Azerbaijani refugees. Troops were sent in. Unarmed soldiers tried to bring the brutal hooligans to their senses. Many young soldiers were wounded, some permanently disabled. However, I believe the consequences would have been even more severe if the soldiers had been armed. We have often been reproached for `showing weakness.' But when we were forced to bring in the militia and military units to avoid further bloodshed, we again fell under fire of criticism, this time for using force. There is no doubt that the government had to act in the way they did. Extreme measures were due to extreme circumstances. The same thing would have been done in any democratic state. The massacres in Sumgait produced universal outrage, everyone was shaken. At the same time, sympathy was shown in the Muslim republics for the people of their faith. Events threatened to get out of control. The question of Nagorno-Karabagh was considered at the extraordinary Politburo meeting on 3 March, where I noted that the situation had reached a critical stage, that we had been late in dealing with Sumgait and had underestimated its implications. `Protective measures may be required,' said I, `in order to prevent loss of life, as occurred in Sumgait. The main thing is to use political methods. However, authority must always be authority. And when it must be used, it must be used in time. The law must rule.' I demanded that those responsible should be swiftly brought to justice, and that steps must be taken so that chaos would not `spill over' again. However, I also demanded that we avoid further attempts at a `quick fix' in favor of working together patiently with our Armenian and Azerbaijani comrades. Even before these tragic events I had a fairly complete picture of the sources of the conflict. Let us recall that the Armenians had suffered both from Persians and from Turks. Could they really erase from their memory the genocide of 1915, when the Turks slaughtered a million and a half Armenians and scattered two million through the world? Eventually they turned to Russia, not out of love for their tsar, but in the hope of safety. They came to the Russian people for protection. But the roots of the Azeris in Karabagh also went deep. Lenin had understood the complexity of this problem and commissioned [Georgy] Chicherin, the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, to look into the matter. Under Stalin those who were in charge of nationality affairs lacked subtlety. Problems and difficulties accumulated over the decades. The Azerbaijan leadership did not treat the Karabagh population in the spirit of the traditions of Lenin, and sometime they simply acted in an inhumane way. Problems of language and culture arose, and serious mistakes were made in the cadre policy. All of this was brought to light under glasnost. Problems quickly came to a head. In both republics many highly placed officials had soiled themselves by corruption. But when perestroika began and they sensed that the ground was shaking under them, it was these elements who tried to provoke ethnic conflicts. The national feelings of people became the object of merciless exploitation. In their hands Karabagh was a mine laid underneath perestroika. We decided: (1) to publish our analysis of the situation in the press; (2) that the General Secretary [of the Communist party] should speak on television; (3) the question should be taken up in the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet; (4) the report of the procurator's office on the investigation of the events in Sumgait should be published; (5) administrative agencies were to decide on the stationing of troops at flash points, but without imposing a curfew. The Azerbaijan and Armenian leaders were again told to come to an understanding. This they were unable to do. Again the question was sent back to us for a decision. At the Politburo session of 6 July 1988, I expressed the opinion that some people in the higher levels of power in the republics were fanning the flames and igniting passions. `The one thing that we can never agree to is to support one people to the detriment of another,' I said. `We must never be blackmailed into this. We will not permit, we must in no case allow the truth to be sought through blood!' Under pressure from public opinion, the deputies of the Armenian Supreme Soviet resolved to agree to the transfer of Nagorno-Karabagh to Armenia, and asked the USSR Supreme Soviet to consider this matter. Two days later the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet declared this to be unacceptable, and announced measures to accelerate the social and economic development of Nagorno-Karabagh. On 25 June public meetings were held in Stepanakert. The people were angry that the local press had not reported the February resolution of the NagornoKarabagh Soviet concerning its exit from Azerbaijan. Tension grew rapidly. Meetings and strikes in Stepanakert continued. Then, on 6 July, the airport in Yerevan was blockaded. The Nagorno-Karabagh Oblast Soviet again passed a resolution `on withdrawal,' but in Baku it was again declared to be illegal. What could we do? What was the way out of the situation? [Andrei] Gromyko suggested the usual solution: `The army will appear on the street and order will be restored immediately.' [Viktor] Chebrikov objected. Yakovlev proposed that the administration of Nagorno-Karabagh should be transferred to Moscow. [Eduard] Shevardnadze was in favor of immediately giving Nagorno-Karabagh autonomous republic status. Ligachev tried to synthesize all of these ideas: `There are already 20,000 refugees. People are homeless. If republic status for Nagorno-Karabagh does not help, we must bring in the troops, dismantle factories, dismiss the Party organizations and Soviet executive committees and establish order.' I supported the proposal to set up an autonomous republic, but I felt that this matter had to be resolved by the conflicting sides themselves. The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet met on 18 July. All parties were invited to present their views. The session was broadcast on television, so that everyone's position would be clear to the general public. Our position -- that of the central authorities -- was supported by most people. `How do you wish to solve this problem?' I asked. `Victory at any price? Armenia wants to incorporate Nagorno-Karabagh. Azerbaijan does not intend to allow this and will not yield even a millimeter. This is all unrealistic! We must find a compromise that will suit everyone. Only a common victory will be a real victory. You cannot resolve issues while you are fighting one another. This is a political blind alley. Sumgait and other events concerning NagornoKarabagh have already made a deep imprint on the relations between the two peoples and it will take time for this to be smoothed over even a little. But even so, we must meet each other half way and find a compromise.' Suggestions were made at the meeting for strengthening the guarantees to the residents of Nagorno-Karabagh in order to prevent a repetition of the violence. In the past there had been many promises, but they had turned out to be hallow -- essentially a fraud. I proposed that a special commission for consideration of all proposals be set within the framework of the Council of Nationalities of the USSR Supreme Soviet. This commission was created and carried out useful work. Rasul Gamzatov's speech made a strong impression on me. He proposed that the administration of Nagorno-Karabagh be transferred temporarily to the Union's central agencies. Subsequently, the commission of the Council of Nationalities put forward the very same proposal. On 20 July the resolution of the Presidium, reiterating that a change of boundaries was impossible, was published. On 26 July the Party Central Committee and the USSR Supreme Soviet Presidium passed a resolution to send an emissary, Arkady Volksky, to Nagorno-Karabagh. However, the situation did not normalize. On 21 September a state of emergency was declared and a curfew was put into effect in Stepanakert and the Agdam districts. After the autumn session of the USSR Supreme Soviet on 3 December, I met with deputies from Azerbaijan and Armenia and the leaders of both republics and Nagorno-Karabagh. Ryzhkov, Slyumkov, Chebrikov, Lukyanov and Razumovsky were also present. `We are on the brink of disaster,' I told them. `You, the respected representatives of the two peoples, must sit down and together find a way out of this mess.' ....[Discussion of the earthquake in Armenia] Today I am even more convinced that the nationality issue can never be resolved by force. The tsars fought wars for decades in North Caucasus, creating a system of fortresses, Cossack settlements, punishing, threatening, destroying, and all to naught, for nothing good came form all this. The only positive results came from trade, co-operation among peoples, the establishment of an alliance with the ruling elite and tribal elders, which brought them closer to the tsar's court, honors and privileges. A kind of new association developed after the October Revolution. In spite of all the faults of this union, a certain balance of interests was preserved. The peacemaking process was extremely complicated. It was even made more difficult by, among other things, the general atmosphere that had developed in the country, in the Supreme Soviets of the USSR and Russia. Essentially, there were two positions. One was that the moment the conflict developed -- especially after the events in Sumgait -- it was necessary to strike decisively against the `instigators' of the disturbances in Nagorno-Karabagh and nip the riots in the bud. The other position was to ask: since the people of Karabagh wished to reunite with their motherland, and we recognized the right of nations to self-determination, why not allow this? After all, the Nakhichevan autonomous republic is a part of Azerbaijan, even though separated from Azerbaijan by Armenian territory. The Nagorno-Karabagh question could be solved in exactly the same way. At some point it seemed that a possible solution was to give Karabagh, like Nakhichevan, the status of autonomous republic, while keeping it as part of Azerbaijan. There was a time when this proposal was on the point of being implemented. However, it was just at this moment that the Supreme Soviet in Yerevan passed a resolution to incorporate Nagorno-Karabagh as part of Armenia and so everything fell apart. It fell apart because of internal antagonism, because the battle for power, for replacement of the ruling elite, was already in full swing there. It fell apart because the Armenian National Movement, which was formed on the basis of the Karabagh committee, was in a hurry to seize power. In this connection another possibility was mentioned in the Politburo meeting: the central authorities should use the armed forces to preserve the status quo. In other words, preserve the status quo in favor of Azerbaijan; at least this would be done not by Azeri extremists, but by forces of legitimate power. I asked my colleagues: `OK, so we introduce rule from the center. Then what?' I did not get a clear answer. Some members were very strongly in favor of `imposing order.' Under such conditions it was not easy to defend my position. Nevertheless, I held to it from beginning to end, even though in extreme cases we were unable to avoid strictly limited harsh measures. During this time, 1987-8, I strove to work out a uniform democratic approach to disputes between nationalities. The conflict over Nagorno-Karabagh did not at all push into the background other, seemingly more tranquil, but no less significant processes which were gaining strength in the Baltic republics, Moldova and Georgia, and which have begun in Central Asia and in Ukraine. Issues such as the languages of indigenous people, economic sovereignty, and expanding rights were raised more and more frequently in various regions. To counter Russification, people often went to the other extreme, thus introducing a spirit of confrontation into the mass consciousness. However, in 1987 no one raised the question of withdrawal from the Union except, perhaps, for extremist groups such as the Estonian independence association, J. Barkans's group in Latvia, and certain nationalist groups in Lithuania. But we were unable to achieve harmony of interests, where should the way out be sought? In patiently and persistently working for the achievement of a compromise, but mainly in changing the very conditions that produced the conflict. Indeed I believed that a lasting solution to the problems between nationalities could be found only in the general context of economic and political reform. By the end of my time as President I had no doubt that preservation and renewal of the Union could keep the peace. A formula was put forward: `A strong center and strong republics.' Others expressed it differently: `Strong republics and a strong center.' Either way, it basically comes down to the same. After all, the new center was to be formed on different foundations, to deal with issues such as security, co-ordination of the fundamentals of economic and social policy, co-ordination of foreign policy, maintaining order at borders, and so forth. And, of course, playing the role of arbiter when conflicts arose.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1997-01-04,0
"Irish Born Israeli President Tells Amazing Story. Living History by Chaim Herzog, Pantheon, 425 pp, illustrated, index, $30. Belfast-born Chaim Herzog, statesman and scholar, was ten years president of Israel, a country where his father, Isaac Herzog, served as cheifrabbi, having left the like role in Dublin to move to Israel. Rabbi Herzogis older son, Chaim, grew up in Dublin, attended Wesley College, where George Bernard Shaw has studied, took up rugby and boxing, and fell in love with Irish culture as well as Jewish culture. In this revelling and frank memoir, he discusses his early days in Ireland, his days studying the Talmud in a Tel Aviv yeshiva, his boyhood service with the Haganah, the Jewish underground defense force in Jerusalem, his years in the British army in World War II and his political career in Israel. He tells the story with good humor and wit but does not hesitate to give frank appraisals of the politically great Israelis with whom he worked, and other statesmen with whom he dealt. In 1985 as President of Israel, with his wife of many years, Aura, Egypt-born daughter of a rabbi, Herzog made a state visit to Ireland-a visit of particular interest to me. An accomplished linguist who spoke Hebrew, Arabic, English, French, German and Yiddish, Herzog says he had pretty well forgotten the Irish he studied in school al-though he had passed his examinations in it. Unable to find any Irish speakers among the nuns in the churches and monasteries in Israel, he appealed to General William Donovan, commander of a United Nations force in Lebanon. The general sent a colonel and a Lieutenant colonel who translated into Irish, and prepared phonetic texts for him. It is an impossible language, he writes, but it was a wonderful visit. In Cork, the former mayor, Gerald Goldberg, welcomed him in Hebrew. In Dublin, He writes, I attended a service at the Adelaide Road Synagogue, where I had been bar mitzvahed. I addressed the congregation from the same pulpit from which my father had addressed me. I talked about my youth and my bar mitzvah and my father, and before I was done, the entire congregation was in tears. The Jewish community has the lectern inscribed indicating that it had been my father's and that I had spoken from it on the occasion of my state visit, and gave it to me as a memento. In Dublin, also, he inaugurated the Jewish museum. Some years later the Dublin municipality established a park named Herzog in his honor. Elsewhere he remarks on the unique bond that exists between Jews all over the world, a bond that can cause open emotion. I suppose, he continues, It's because Jews have been so oppressed over the years, we tend to move toward each other as family members would. The closest I have seen to this bonding is the Irish. They react much the same way when they meet another Irish man in a strange and foreign location. It has been said of Ireland that it is a small country with a large history, and the same is surely true of Israel. To read Herzog's account of his life is almost to read the history of Israel. He was there before the state was founded, fought alongside the founding fathers, passed the bar in Israel, and served in the Israel armed forces, and then in the presidency. In world War II, he volunteered for the British army, and ended up in military intelligence. Much of his time was spent in questioning German prisoners of war, a job which kept him moving around Europe a good deal. His account of the schooling that he received in military intelligence is revealing. He knew more about the German army than the men he questioned. That training enabled him to set up the military intelligence of the Israeli armed forces which is acknowledged today to be one of the best in the world. He gives his personal opinion of the various dignitaries that he had met, particularly when he was the Israeli ambassador to the United Nations. At the time he had no stauncher friend than Daniel Patrick Moynihan, now United States senator from New York. President Ronald Reagan and President Clinton he deems the two best friends that Israel has had in the White House. Senator Moynihan, in a jacket blurb on the book, writes, A write and fascinating Irishmen. Chaim Herzog has made historic contributions as a warrior, diplomat and statesman. He writes with the same vitality be brought to each of his previous careers. In the same manner, Prime Minister John Major writes. Chaim Herzog has been a beacon of wisdom and moderation. He will always receive the warmest of welcomes in my country. The London Time said of him that he is a lion statesman in a world of mice. His personal relations with the Arabs at the U.N. were warm, however bitter the public repartee between them, and in Israel he managed to keep the respect and admiration of the vast majority of the rival factions. In 1957, as a lieutenant colonel in the Israel army he was named chief of staff of the Southern command, which took in sixty percent of the Israeli territory but only five percent of the population. In that year he went to Dublin to accept a tribute the Irish government was paying to his father who was too ill to make the trip. The next year, his father died. His years as chief rabbi in Israel has been distinguished by his mediation among warring factions, secular and religious. Herzog writes, however, that toward the end of his life, my father became depressed having foreseen the dangerous and destructive confrontation between Israel, religious and nonreligious factions. He adds, His humanistic views were an integral part of his religious - which is what the Jewish faith is all about; It is the most humanistic of all religious. But the extreme religious factions, the strict Orthodox, have let their religious beliefs turn them against the very government that is still fighting for their national independence. While he thinks the strike Orthodox factions are a threat to Israel's internal stability, he believes the Muslim fundamentalist movement is the great threat to the civilized world and not Israel alone. He opens the memoir with a brief history of Jews in Ireland. At the time of his birth, there were approximately 5000 Jews in Ireland, he says. He was born in his rabbi-fanther's home at 2 Norman Villas in Belfast. Nine months later his father was invited to become chief rabbi of Ireland with a seat in Dublin. His father was native of Lomza, Poland, the son of a rabbi. While president of Israel, Herzog visited the town and laid a wreath on the spot where the synagogue had stood. In Dubblin his father was well-known for supporting the Irish struggle for independence, and his father was honored as he walked through the streets. That didn't stop some young bigots from throwing stones at them. Ireland, he writes, has no history of anti-Semitism, and while I did not fee outcast, I did feel different. I was always aware that somewhere in the background for a crime, the entire Jewish community shuddered because it was expected that all Jews would be thought guilty of that crime. Later he writes, Very few Jews mingled socially with non-Jews. A visit from a non-Jew was a major event, and the best finery and airs were exhibited. His parents in their two years in Belfast, nevertheless developed life-long friendships. In their eighteen years in Dublin, his father became a world figure, renowned as an outspoken scholar and master of many languages. His father spent hours with him and his younger brother, Yaacov, walking in the botanical and zoological gardens and relating all the plants and animals to some place or event in the Bible. They made many trips to England, and Herzog writes that while being Jewish in Ireland was on cultural conflict, being Irish in England was another. As a child, he remembered the gunfire of the civil war. Throughout his father was an open partisan of the Irish cause. He and Yaacov were sent to Alexandra College and then to Wesley College whose most famous graduate was George Bernard Shaw. For the school's 100th anniversary, they asked for a message form Shaw as part of the celebration. They wrote twice but he did not reply. The third time, he answered, via a postcard, If you don't stop pestering me, I will write what I really thought about the place. Like Chaim, the younger brother became a lawyer. He rose to be Israeli ambassador to Canada and for many years was responsible for Israel's diplomatic relations with the Vatican. He died young. Now in his retirement, Herzog is worried about the internal conflicts in Israel, and yet remains a man of quiet optimism based on the durability of the Jewish people. He closes by saying one must dream.","Kenny, Herbert A",The Boston Irish Reporter,1997-01-01,0
"1996: Year of The Ash. FRANK McCourt finished an incredible year at the Number One position on the New York times national bestseller list, for his non-fiction memoirs, Angela's Ashes. The Brooklyn-born and Limerick-raised first time author has been listed among the New York Times top ten since shortly after the book was published in September, although in the first week of December it seemed to be on the decline with a Number 13 ranking. But the very next week, Angela's Ashes shot to Number One, a remarkable place for a literary debut which details a miserable and occasionally hilarious childhood. I guess it's some sort of a Christmas book, said McCourt, reached at his Manhattan apartment on Monday. My doorman told me back in September that it would go no higher than Number Four, said McCourt. I took great pleasure in telling him that he was wrong and that there'll be no Christmas tip for him this year. McCourt added, He is a Muslim though, so maybe I'll get him at Ramadan. Nor surprisingly, Angela's Ashes won top marks from almost everyone who took part in an Irish Voice survey of Metropolitan area authors, journalists and others. The results of the survey are as follows... THOMAS CAHILL (author of How The Irish Saved Civilization): Angela's Ashes. The best book on childhood since Rudyard Kipling wrote Baa Baa Black Sheep. ANGELA CARTER (proprietor, The Irish Bookshop, Manhattan): The New York Irish, edited by ronald Bayor and Timothy Meagher. MARION CASEY (historian; Ph.D. candidate at NYU): The New York Irish, edited by Ronald H. Bayor and Timothy J. Meaher. It's what `Gaelic Gotham' [last summer's Museum of the City of New York exhibit] could have been. MICHAEL DALY (author of Underground; columnist for New York Daily News): Bloody Shame by Carolina Garcia. PAT DOHERTY (New York City Comptroller's office): The Unredeemed Captive by John Demos. The story of how Deerfield, Massachusetts, was attacked and enslaved during the French and Indian war. Sorry, I'm not one to read the best-sellers. JIM DWYER (author of Subway Lives, columnist for New York Daily News): Catching Bodies by Phil Mahony. T.J ENGLISH (author of Born to Kill and The Westies): My Dark Places by James Ellroy. It's about the murder of Ellroy's mother, which happened when he was 10 and which was never solved. KARL GEARY (actor; writer; co-owner of The Scratcher bar in the East Village): Amongst Women by John McGahern TERRY GOLWAY (columnist, New York Observer): The Inheritance by Samuel Freedman. It took three Catholic families - one Irish, one Italian and one Polish I believe - and traced them from the grandparents, who were New Deal Democrats, to the grandchildren, who have become Pataki Republicans. an absolutely tremendous and fascinating look at probably the most important political development since 1960. PETE HAMILL (Editor, New York Daily News; author of numerous books): Angela's Ashes. To have as the Non-Fiction Number One an actual good book, and not some diet book or another O.J. book, is fantastic. JARED HARRIS (actor who played Warhol in the 1996 film I Shot Andy Warhol): Speed Tribes by Karl Taro Greenfeld. A great book of short stories, or rather, character studies, of various strange subcultures in Tokyo. PATRICIA HARTY (Editor, Irish America magazine): Angela's Ashes, Nuala O'Faolain's Are You Somebody and Seamus Heaney's Spirit Level. TOM KELLY (New York-based author of Payback, a novel to be released in early 1997): Angela's Ashes, and Songdogs by Colm McCann. ANNE MAGUIRE (film researcher, member of Irish Lesbian & Gay Organization): Rat Bohemia by Sarah Schulman. It just came out in paperback. Everybody should read it - it's fantastic. COLM MCCANN (author of Songdogs and Fishing the Sloe-Back River): Down by the River by Edna O'Brien (released in the U.S. in early 1997) and To The Wedding by John Burger. FRANK MCCOURT (author, Angela's Ashes): Samuel Beckett: The Last Modernist Anthony Cronyn. It's the richest bio I've read since [Richard] Ellman's bio of James Joyce. I got it just the other day and I was all up all night with it. And no, I won't pick Angela's Ashes. TOM MCKENNA (NYPD Detective and author of Manhattan North Homicide): Edge of the City by Dan Mahoney: I read mostly crime stuff and right now I'm following the career of Danny Mahoney. [Dean] Koontz died this year and I think the new up and coming guy is definitely Mahoney. SUSAN MCKEOWN (singer, The Chanting House): Murder Ballads by Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds. Okay, I know it's not a book, but I didn't read that much this year. I listened to music. KATE MCLOUGHLIN (co-owner of Irish Visions, a music, books and video store in the Bronx): Angela's Ashes; Michael Collins by Tim Pat Coogan and How the Irish Saved Civilization by Thomas Cahill. CHARLOTTE MOORE (Director, the Irish Repertory Theater, Manhattan): Angela's Ashes. Perhaps you've heard of it? How can I pick anything else? JANET NOBLE (author of the Irish immigration play Away Alone, soon to be released as a feature film): Angela's Ashes. After I read it I gave it to my mother. She loved it and was very touched by it because there were many things in her childhood that sort of paralleled Frank's. It turned out to be her last book. Before she died, she passed it to my Aunt Rose, and it's been passed on since to the point that I now have at least 20 relatives in New Jersey who have been happily watching it climb up the charts. EAMON O'KELLY (former Irish Voice columnist): I can't narrow it down to one. Arthur Quinn's A New World, about the interaction of the French, English and Dutch settlers with the American Indians; Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization, and the paperback version of Peter Quinn's Banished Children of Eve. And anything by Patrick O'Brien. JOHN O'MAHONY (New York Post reporter): Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh. Great f--ing book. The movie is merely a preview of how good this book is. JOHN TIMONEY (former NYPD Chief and recently-appointed vice-chair of New York State Commission on Domestic Violence): You Have to Scream With Your Mouth Closed by Karina Colgan. It's very depressing, absolutely horrific. But a wonderful book. Photo (Frank McCourt, the first time author finished 1996 with a bang.)","Rohan, Brian",Irish Voice,1996-12-30,0
"1996: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; Church affairs; Sobors and Synods. In religious matters, 1996 was a year of consecrations of new bishops, more inter- and intra-confessional strife in Ukraine, and the 400th anniversary of the Union of Brest, which included the first Sobor of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and a Synod of Bishops. The year began with the consecration of the Rev. Cornelius John Pasichny as the Ukrainian Catholic eparch of Saskatoon on January 17. The 68-year old Basilian priest was elevated at St. Nicholas Ukrainian Catholic Church in Winnipeg, where he had served as pastor for the past decade and had been baptized as a child. His consecrators included Bishop Severian Yakymyshyn, who was elevated to the episcopacy in March 1995, Canadian Archbishop-Metropolitan Michael Bzdel and Bishop Busil Filevich, his predecessor. Then on April 17, the Ukrainian Catholic Church elevated the Rev. Stephen Soroka to assist one of its ailing leaders. Canadian Archbishop-Metropolitan Bzdel, who had just undergone quintuple bypass heart surgery. The Rev. Soroka, 44, who had been the Archeparchy's chancellor, now carried the title auxiliary bishop. The youngest Canadian bishop was consecrated on June 13 at Ss. Valdimir and Olga Cathedral in Winnipeg. On may 3, Canada's first Ukrainian Catholic archbishop-metropolitan, Maxim Hermaniuk, who had retired in 1992 and was succeeded by Metropolitan Bzdel, passed away. He was 84. The Redemptorist monk was born in Nove Selo in western Ukraine in 1911, and was ordained a priest in 1938. Fluent in several languages, including ancient Babylonian, he received his licentiate from the University of Louvain in Belgium in 1943 in Oriental languages and history. He was elevated to auxiliary bishop of the Exarchate of Winnipeg in 1951. He was appointed Canada's first Ukrainian Catholic metropolitan on November 3, 1956, and was enthroned on February 12, 1957, in Ss. Vladimir and Olga Cathedral in Winnipeg. More than 1,000 people attended his funeral at the same cathedral on May 2, 1996. The most prominent of several new appointments to head Ukrainian Greek-Catholic eparchies around the world was that of Bishop Lubomyr Husar to the newly established Kyiv-Vyshhorod Exarchate in Ukraine on April 2. Bishop Husar had been consecrated by the Lviv archbishop major and head of the Church, Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, 19 years earlier at the Studite Monastery in Castelgandolfo, near Rome. The 63-year-old Studite monk, along with Bishop Ivan Choma, who was named Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky's special envoy to Rome the same day, were the last Ukrainian Greek-Catholic bishops to come out of the underground when they were consecrate by Patriarch Josyf. Bishop Husar was installed as the Kyiv-Vyshhorod exarch on June 2 at the chapel-rotunda known as Askold's Mound (Asokdova Mohyla). The even was attended by the papal nuncio, Cardinal Antonio Franco, Patriarch Filaret of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Partriarchate and Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Bishops Pavlo Vasylyk, Yulian Voronovsky, Vasyl Medvit, Ivan Margitych, Mykhailo Sabryha and Mykhail Koltun. In a year of shake-ups and restructuring for the Ukrainian Catholic Church, Bishop Husar, still for settled into his chair as the leader of the Kyiv-Vyshhorod Exarchate, was moved again on October 14. The bedridden leader of the Church, Cardinal Lubachivsky, assigned him extraordinary powers as his auxiliary bishop, which as approved by both the Synod of Bishop, which had just been completed, and the Vatican. The role that Bishop Husar was not to assume was not clear at the time of his appointment. However, Archbishop-Metropolitan of the United States Stephen Sulky told The Weekly a the time that Bishop Husar had been granted almost all the powers of the Church. He has the power to call synods, to preside over them and to approve their decisions. According to Bishop Husar, his is a humble role. He said on October 22 at a press conference in Kyiv that he was appointed merely to carry out the responsibilities and the duties of Cardinal Lubachivsky, and that upon the archbishop major's death, his position is liquidated, and carries on right to succession. When His Beatitude dies, and with God's blessing that will not happen soon, all my authority dies with him, said Bishop Husar. The new administrative leader of the Church said he was returning to Lviv to be close to the ailing Cardinal Lubachivsky. A new exarch for Kyiv-Vyshhorod would soon be appointed, he stated. That happened less than a month later, on November 13. Bishop Husar, with Cardinal Lubachivsky's approval, appointed Bishop Koltun, 47, the second exarch of Kyiv-Vyshhorod. Bishop Koltun, who has had a dramatic rise in the Church, was installed a bishop in September 1993 at St. George Cathedral in Lviv, the seat of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church. He was the first bishop consecrated in Ukraine since the Church had come out of the underground. The decision to give Bishop Husar his new responsibility was made at the Synod of Bishops held in October in Lviv in conjunction with the historic first Sobor of the Church. It also coincided with celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the Union of Brest, proclaimed on October 16, 1596, which reunited a portion of Ukrainian Orthodoxy with Rome after the Muslim conquests of Constantinople, divisions within the Ukrainian Church and the establishment of the Moscow Patriarchate. The Sobor, held on October 6-10 and attended by representatives of the Church's laity, clergy and hierarchy, was deemed an unqualified success by Bishop Husar. I was also impressed with the fact that our whole Church was at the Sobor - bishops, priests, the laity - all of whom took active part in the discussions ... the collaborations among the various elements of our people is of itself proof of the vitality of our Church, said the bishop. What showed the extent of the revival of the Church in Ukraine was the turnout for a divine liturgy that was celebrated on Freedom Square on October 13. Some 30,000 people attended the service under a dazzling blue sky. The stood on park benches and on the large flower pots that dot the square for almost there hours, as Canada's Archbishop Bzdel celebrated the liturgy, with Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, representative for Pope John Paul II, and Papal Nuncio to Ukraine Antonio Franco in attendance, as well as all the bishops of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and a large number of the clergy. While murmurs already abounded at that time that Bishop Husar would because assistant to the leader of the Church, other ones regarding the recognition of a patriarchate by Rome and a visit by the pope also were heard. Cardinal Silvestrini quickly put to rest any notion of a visit to Ukraine by the pope in 1997 when he told The Weekly in a quick interview in Lviv that too many matters still had to be worked out with the Ukrainian government. He added, We can look at the visit with hope, but at the moment nothing is decided. As for hope by the faithful of the Ukrainian Catholic Church that a patriarchate would soon be recognized by the Vatican, that still hangs in limbo. As the head of the Ukrainian World Patriarchal Federation. Wasyl Kolodchin, put it, the failure of the Vatican to act on recognition of a patriarchate for Ukraine is Strictly political in nature. The only hindrance to recognizing a patriarchate is the Moscow Patriarchate (of the Orthodox Church). As unsettled as the situation was with the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, more so were issues surrounding the Orthodox Churches of Ukraine (there are currently three). First the Moscow Patriarchate held an anti-Sobor in Lviv during the time of the ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church's conference. Leaders of the Church, including Moscow Patriarch Aleksey II, Kyiv Metropolitan Volodymyr Sabodan and Metropolitan of the United Stated and Canada Feodosiy sent a letter greeting that conference, held at the Russian Pushkin Society building. The Orthodox sobor discussed how to prevent a visit by Pope John Paul II, which had been rumored for 1997, and that Uniates had persecuted Orthodox. Other problems within Orthodoxy had arisen earlier. On March 5 at a news conference in Kyiv, Patriarch Filaret of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyvi Patriarchate stated that the recent rift between Constantinople and Moscow, which considers itself the Third Rome in terms of mainstream Christianity, over Constantinople's recognition of the Estonian Patriarchate could lead to the end of the Russian spiritual empire. The leader of the Kyiv Patriarchate had been negotiating with constantinople for reunion and recognition by the universal seat of Orthodoxy on Ukraine's position in the Church. Then at the Synod of Bishop held on October 18-19, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church announced that its Patriarch Dymytrii had resigned. Metropolitan Vasylii of Temopil and Lviv was assigned in his place. the newspaper Den wrote that the five hierarchs of the Church had sought for a long time to remove Patriarch Dymytrii for usurping power. His right-hand man, Bishop Ihor Isichenko of Kharkiv, was removed by the Synod after the announcement. (The Weekly will cover alleged financial improprieties on both sides in the first issues of 1997.) On issue that might have finally been resolved, and was a matter between Church and state, was the status of the place where Patriarch Volodymyr of the ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate, is interred. On July 14 more than 1,000 people gathered in front of St. Sophia Cathedral to pay tribute to the leader of the Church on the first anniversary of his death. His gravesite, which had been dug form the asphalt and rock before the belltower of St. Sophia a year earlier amidst brutal police force, was now besplendored with flowers and a marble sarcophagus, courtesy of the city of Kyiv. Mayor Oleksander Omelchenko had pledged on June 18 that a memorial outside the walls of the historic cathedral would be built for the late patriarch at a coast of $71,000. At the time of his burial in 1995, militia and Ministry of Internal Affairs police had bloodied dozens because the faithful resisted a decision by the government that the patriarch could not be buried in St. Sophia Cathedral. Other notable events in Church affairs included the following: * Metropolitans, archbishops and bishops of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople), representing eparchies in Canada, the U.S. South America, Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand and faithful communities in western Europe gathered on June 25-26 for an in-depth discussion of the challenges before the Church. * The Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Stamford celebrated 25 years since Bishop Basil Losten was installed as its eparch on May 22. * Poland's new Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Archbishop Jan Martyniak announced on August 17 that the Peremyshl seat of the Church had been upgraded by the Vatican to a metropolitan archdiocese.

"The Traces of 2000 Years Attest to the Vital Armenian Presence in. Jerusalem: Visit of Patriarch Torkom is a Reminder of the Continuing Armenian Legacy in the Holy City NEW YORK, NY - With the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem, His Beatitude Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, presently visiting the United States, many Armenians have been inspired to learn more about, or renew their acquaintance with, the story of the Armenian legacy in the Holy City. It is a story which dates back to before the time of Christ, and which has continued, without interruption, through Jerusalem's many political and social incarnations. Indeed, the importance of the Holy City to Armenians -- and its vital influence on Armenian history -- continues into the present. Since ancient times, Armenians have maintained close military, commercial, political and cultural ties with the Holy Land. The invasion of Palestine by the Armenian king Tigran the Great in c. 75 B.C., and the settlement of thousands of Jews in the cities of Armenia, established permanent channels of communication between Jerusalem and Armenia. Due to these channels, Christianity penetrated Armenia at a very early date. At the inception of the Christian church in the 1st century, there were Armenian travelers in Jerusalem. According to the 2nd century church father Tertullian, the Apostles of Christ preached to people from Armenia right after the Pentecost. Other ancient sources refer to 4th- and 5th-century Armenian clergymen who went to pilgrimages and dwelt in the Holy Land. In the early 20th century, archaeologists unearthed in Jerusalem a series of mosaics with Armenian inscriptions. The script used in the inscriptions resembles the type developed by St. Mesrob Mashdots, the 5th-century creator of the Armenian alphabet. The largest of the mosaics, which covers the floor of the hall, is a cherished tourist site today. The church of Jerusalem was chronologically the first Christian church in history, and the first bishop of that church was St. Church, called the Brother of our Lord in the gospels. In A.D. 387, the Ecumenical Council of Constantinople accorded honor to the See of Jerusalem equal to that of Rome and Constantinople, so that the occupants of the See were called patriarchs. Despite the theological disputes that rent Christendom asunder, the line of bishops continued throughout the Byzantine period. When the Arabs occupied Palestine in the mid-7th century, the Armenians -- disputing the orthodoxy of the Byzantine bishop -- set up a new bishop of Armenian faith as the true successor to St. James, a claim supported by the fact that the body of St. James is buried under the patriarchal throne located in the St. James Cathedral of the Armenian Patriarchate. The first Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem was Abraham, who served from 638 to 669 A.D. HOME TO PILGRIMS AND MONASTERIES According to the Armenian tradition, a practicing Christian would go on pilgrimage to Jerusalem at least once in his or her lifetime. Despite political and economic turmoil, thousands of Armenians flocked to the Holy Land every year. It is said that in past times, the St. James Monastery could accommodate as many as eight thousand pilgrims at a given time. Pilgrimage brought to the Holy City renowned Armenian clergymen and statesmen, kings and princes, all of whom presented gifts and left their mark. One can still see carved on the walls of churches groups of very small Armenian crosses. Local tradition holds that these were inscribed by pilgrims, and the clusters represent the number of people in the family of each pilgrim. In Armenian society it was a great honor for someone to have gone on pilgrimage in Jerusalem. Such an act secured for the pilgrim a special social status, and he or she was referred thereafter as Mahdesi -- One who saw death -- a reference to the Tomb of Christ. By the second half of the 7th century, there were more than seventy Armenian monasteries in the Holy Land. The present-day Armenian Quarter in Jerusalem -- home to a closely knit community of hundreds of Armenian families -- occupies the site of some of these ancient monasteries. Enclosed within the present quarter are the St. James Monastery, the Monastery of the Holy Archangels, and the Holy Saviour Monastery. Outside of the Armenian Quarter, the Armenian Church enjoys equal rights with the Orthodox and the Roman Catholic Churches at sacred sites such as the Holy Sepulcher, the Garden of Gethsemane, the Grave of the Holy Virgin Mary, the Nativity site in Bethlehem, and other places. Armenians also have a historic monastery in Jaffa right on the sea front, and possesses lands and buildings in various places in Israel. Under Muslim rule, the Armenian patriarchs of Jerusalem and the members of the St. James Brotherhood succeeded in protecting the rights of the Armenian Church -- frequently at the cost of their lives. The Patriarchate has remained a haven for Armenian refugees throughout its history; during the mass extermination of Armenians in Ottoman Turkey in 1915 which has come to be known as the Armenian Genocide, thousands of refugees and orphans were taken in by the Patriarchate. During the past several countries, the Brotherhood, headed by able and talented patriarchs, has preserved intact the Armenian sites and turned Jerusalem into a major center of learning. Besides the sites, which are open museums, the Patriarchate houses the second largest Armenian manuscript library in the world. It also maintains an extensive collection of vestments and vessels, inscriptions, paintings, a library, a bookstore and two printing plants. The St. James Press, founded the 1833, is the oldest in Jerusalem. The Armenian Patriarchate is renowned for the Patriarchal Seminary founded in 1843. Many of the Armenian clergymen serving in parishes throughout the United States are graduates of this seminary, which is still functioning. The lure of attending the seminary in the Holy City has attracted some of the finest teachers and students of modern times. The present patriarch, His Beatitude Archbishop Torkom Manoogian -- formerly Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America -- is a graduate of the seminary and its former dean.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1996-11-02,0
"Rep. Thomas Speaks Out Against Genocide Denial. This Congressional profile is the seventh of a series, produced by the Armenian Assembly of America as a public service. Based on exclusive interviews, the profiles are intended to familiarize readers with members of Congress who have supported Armenian issues on Capitol Hill. WASHINGTON, D.C. - It is still shocking to me to hear people argue that it didn't happen, or that the numbers of those who perished weren't as high as people say it was, said Congressman William Thomas of the Armenian Genocide, during a recent interview with the Armenian Assembly of America. The California Republican is a member of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues, a cosponsor of the Armenian Genocide resolution and a supporter of a House-passed amendment to link Turkish aid to its recognition of the Genocide. Educated at San Francisco State University, Thomas worked as a professor before entering the political realm. He credits his academic background in Middle East history as the genesis of his interest in Armenian issues. Thomas served in the California State Assembly from 1975 to 1979, before his election to Congress. Currently in his ninth term, he chairs the House Oversight Committee. He also serves on the Ways and Means Committee and the Joint Committee on Taxation. A.A.A.: How did you initially get involved in Armenian issues? Thomas: Believe it or not, one of the ways I became involved was in reading about Bob Dole, and how he was helped by an Armenian doctor. Also, my academic background includes study of Middle East history and the Ottoman Empire. I began to understand and be concerned about the failure to record certain aspects of history, like the Armenian Genocide. Also, through talking with my Chief of Staff, Cathy Swajian Abernathy, about her personal history, I developed more of an understanding about the Armenians. One of the things that struck me was that Armenians are like the Chinese in that they can resettle anywhere, and not only do they survive, they prosper, because they are bright, resourceful and entrepreneurial. It seemed that in that regard, what I noticed of the prominent Chinese community in San Francisco was mirrored in the Armenians. I have also traveled in the Middle East, and everywhere you go you meet Armenians. I heard many accounts of what occurred at the turn of this century though people whose parents, relatives and neighbors lived through the Armenian Genocide. It is still shocking to me to hear people argue that it didn't happen, or that the numbers of those who perished weren't as high as people say it was. As with the Holocaust, you hear about these denials, and then you encounter people you know to be honest people who experienced it firsthand. and these survivors have no reason whatsoever to fabricate these experiences. Being in California and involved in politics, I was there when a state senator from Long Beach, George Deukmejian, was thinking about running for governor. I was the first member of Congress to endorse him at a press conference -- the rest is history. A.A.A.: As you are aware, President Clinton waived the Humanitarian Aid Corridor Act -- which Congress passed overwhelmingly. What is your response to this? Thomas: Well look what has happened in various areas of the world, like in Cuba. You're dealing with the State Department. I guess I would love to say that it was President Clinton who strated it. But I think that it is this institutional, professional State Department which for some reason believes that they are genetically predisposed to be able to deal with foreign policy notwithstanding the Constitution or the interests of any groups. So if they don't happen to agree with us, sometimes it's very difficult. It seems to me that one of the things you have to do is to show that humanitarian aid corridors are absolutely vital -- we maintain them in many other areas where we are willing to place American troops on the line. A.A.A.: What is the most important vote you cast in the 104th Congress? Thomas: Well, that's easy for me to answer -- the most important vote I cast was my first vote, for the speaker, because it meant that for the first time since I've been here the Republicans control the House. What that means is that you get to hold the gavel, set the agenda and accomplish the kinds of things that we've always wanted to but could not. So all substantive votes that we have cast and we will cast are largely possible because of that first vote -- which was, ironically, a procedural vote to set up the ground rules. A.A.A.: What can American Armenians do to promote awareness of American issues among members of Congress? Thomas: I think that what Armenians as a group have been doing is the right thing. I can tell you that you should not carry your concerns like a chip on your shoulder -- and don't see a conspiracy theory or an apologist in every statement made. For example, Turkey is extremely important to the U.S. given its geopolitical position. I fear a potential fundamentalist Muslim movement in Turkey. And I would say that, at the very least, Ataturk did some good things by secularizing that structure. If he hadn't, the potential might be greater than it is. With Armenian Americans, you have a group of people now in their sixties, seventies and eighties, who raised their children in a proud tradition and heritage. Where there is an opportunity to inform or educate others, or to correct misperceptions, there is nothing wrong in doing that. Armenian Americans, and particularly members of the Armenian Assembly, have made enormous strides simply by being strong leaders in the community -- that's the most positive thing you can do.

"The Armenian Church Under the Soviet Regime. How did the Soviet government deal with religion in the USSR? For many year it has been possible to read the reaction of believers to the Soviet state's attempt to control religious groups. But now, Felix Corley's Religion in the Soviet Union: An Archival Reader, for the fist time in English, provides a collection of documents that reveal the struggle between religion and the Communist state from the other side. In their own words, the bureaucrats debate policy, issue orders and seek to maximize their control over all aspects of religious life. Using KGB, Central Committee, Council for Religious Affairs and local official documents, Felix Corley has built up a picture of how policy was applied to religious questions in many different areas of life - with the unchanging aim of control. The book follows the story from the implementation of control in the early Soviet ears (1917-1929) right through to the coming of openness towards religion in the dying days of the Soviet regime (1991). The varying response to the Russian Orthodox Church, the Old Believers, the Catholics, Protestants, the Armenian Church, Jews, Muslims and Buddhists is shown, as well as how the Soviet state tackled newer groups like the Jehovah's Witnesses and Hare Krishnas. There is considerable discussion of Armenian Church affairs in Religion in the Soviet Union. We read: The concern both in Yerevan and in Moscow that the overseas Armenian dioceses should remain loyal to Etchmiadzin was a key factor determining Soviet policy towards the Church. The Council of the Affairs of the Armenian Church [attached to the Council of Ministers of the Armenian SSR] recognized that for Etchmiadzin to retain its authority it had to function above the bare minimum needed for it to survive in order to refute allegations by those like the emigre Dashnak political party who maintained that the Church was a tool of the regime. In another place we read: Because of their key role in relations with overseas Armenians, employees at the Armenian Church's headquarters in Etchmiadzin were particularly closely vetted by the KGB. By 1954 the authorities in Armenia had already noted that many of the more active believers defying legislation on religion were repatriates' and there were already concerns about their loyalty to Soviet Armenia. For years many religious leaders in the USSR were accused of cooperating with the Soviet government but, as Corley demonstrates, The KGB had all the church leaderships [in the USSR] under such tight control that it was difficult or impossible for the top leadership of any group to refuse to give information. Religion in the USSR will be of interest to students of political science and the sociology of religion, as well as historians of the Soviet era and of the different religious faiths. NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS Felix Corley is also the author of The Armenian Church Under the Soviet Regime-Part I: The Leadership of Kevork: State and Society (Kestan Institute, Oxford) vol. 24, No. 1, 1996. This is the first part of an article, based on archival material, that covers the history of the Armenian Church from 1938 up the death of Catholicos Vazken in 1994. Part 2 will be published in the forthcoming issue of the same journal. Corley has conducted extensive research since the soviet archives were opened to scholars and has written widely on religion in the former Soviet Union. Here is a list of state document related to the Armenian Church: 1932 - Document 48 A long report concerning the election of new Catholicos in 1932. The report discusses: - Etchmiadzin in the days of the February Revolution; - The Dashnak Government and Etchmiadzin; - Etchmiadzin and Soviet Power - The Dashnaks and the Election of a new Catholicos The report concludes: either the Soviet government must ban the election of a new catholicos or by all kinds of machination introduce into Etchmiadzin one of its agents, the aim of which would be to destroy the Armenian Church and all the Armenian national organizations completely. 1938 - Document 78 Decree of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party concerning The Work of the League of Militant Godless of Armenia and the State anti-Religious Propaganda. 1948 - Document 100 An informational report on the state of religious cults in the Armenian SSR. The groups that are discussed include: Molokan religious community, Evangelical Christian Baptists, Muslim religious community, Seventh-Day Adventists, and Catholics. Interestingly, the document reveals that the Armenian Catholicos desires to change faith and join the Armenian Apostolic Church. 1950 - Document 104 Catholicos Kevork VI and the desirability of maintaining his prestige before the oversees dioceses and discussion of a decree (kontak) by Kevork VI to withdraw two Armenian archbishops from Iran. 1952 - Document 105 Concerning the Yerevan Committee of Armenian Evangelical Christian Baptists' petition to the government for permission to conduct the rite of baptism of six believing Baptists (women) in the canal of the small town of Nork. 1951 - Document 108 Discusses the issue of rendering organizational and other help to the Etchmiadzin Catholicosate, to achieve there the more active leadership of the overseas dioceses of the Armenian Church. 1951 - Document 109 Concerning the discussion of the Evangelical-Lutheran archbishop of the Baltic republics with Catholicos Kevork on the possibility of having the Catholicos ordain bishops for the Lutheran Church. We read, The Catholicos came to the conclusion that they apparently want, in the words of the Catholicos, the antiquity and apostolic origin of the Armenian Church to be extended in the same form to the Evangelical-Lutheran churches of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 1952 - Document 110 Concerning the unfair arrest of priests and closure of churches. The message reads: Such an approach by representatives of local organs of power in crude. 1952 - Document 111 The case of a self-declared priest. 1953 - Document 116 Permission to destroy the dilapidated building of [a] church, built in the 19th century - with the aim of opening up the more valuable historical monument of the 7th century. 1954 - Document 120 Concerning Artun Atityan's [Hadidyan] appointment as chancellor (secretary) of Etchmiadzin. 1954 - Document 121 Concerning complaints by Archbishop Vahan that former priests insulted him in the church in the presence of parishioners and about those who conduct illegal religious services in believers' homes. 1955 - Document 122 Concerning the fanatical sect of the `Jumpers' in Armenia. 1957 - Document 128 Concerning places of pilgrimage outside the churches and sale of home-made candles, photocards of `saints,' alcoholic drinks and fruits. 1976 - Document 167 Concerning the visit to the United States of a delegation comprised of representatives of churches in the USSR, including the Armenian Church, invited by the `Appeal of Conscience' organization. 1979 - Document 167 A report mentions that the Vatican is especially interested in the sending of Catholic priests to Armenia. 1985 - Document 173 Statistical report on Religions and Churches in the USSR. Statistics on Armenia include: religious organizations; cult servants [clergy]; marriage ceremonies. 1980 - Document 199 Concerning Catholicos Vazken I's planned visit to the United States and its postponement with the aim of frustrating the plans of the secret services of the USA to exploit the visit of the head of the Armenian Church.","Tchilingirian, Hratch",Armenian Reporter International,1996-10-12,0
"A Pilgrimage to Istanbul, The Birthplace of the Armenian Evangelical. Church Following the four-day international celebration of the 150th Anniversary Evangelical Church, from June 27-30, 1996 at Issey-les-Moulineaux, a suburb of Paris, France, I was provileged to lead a group of pilgrims to the birthplace of the Armenian Evangelical Church - Istanbul, Turkey. This mission tour was planned by the Armenian Evangelical World Council and organized by the 150th Anniversary Celebration Committee. The idea was to visit the site where the Armenian Evangelical Church was born, namely, the Armenian Evangelical Church of Pera - the mother church of all Armenian Evangelical churches - and duly celebrate the 150th anniversary. The pilgrimage was held from July 1-8, 1996. The mission tour was composed of ten people. The tour coordinator was Mrs. Maryse Haladjian of Villeurbanne, France. I was the group's spiritual leader and historian. Istanbul, formerly Constantinople, is one of the world's oldest cities and the largest in Turkey, with a population of over 12 million. It was called Constantinople until 1453, when it became the capital of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish government, however, did not insist upon using Istanbul as the name of the city until 1930. It was the capital of Turkey until 1922, when the seat of the government was moved to Ankara. Constantinople was founded by Constantine in 324 A.D. on the site of the earlier city of Byzantium, which had been founded in the 6th century B.C. Constantine made it the capital of his Eastern Empire and called it the New Rome. After the fall of Rome, Constantinople served as the capital of the Byzantine Empire for almost a thousand years. Istanbul is a beautiful city made up of many towns, where many Armenians lived for many centuries. Today, however their number has substantially decreased. There is an estimated population of twenty thousand Armenians and 28 Armenian churches in the city and vicinity, and about a half dozen in the interior provinces of Turkey. There are 15 Apostolic and five Armenian Catholic schools in Istanbul, with a combined student body of approximately three thousand. The Armenian Evangelical constiuency is a tiny minority within the Armenian minority. Numbers are not available, but they do not exceed a couple of hundred. At one time, there were five Armenian Evangelical churches. Only two are currently functional in a qualified sense. They are: 1) The Holy Trinity Armenian Evangelical Church of Aynali Cheshmeh - This is the mother church of Armenian Evangelicalism, organized in 1846. The original sanctuary was built of timber. When the church burned down, a sanctuary in stone was built during 1905-1907. The two-story edifice, built in Gothic architectural style, is imposing externally and beautiful internally. The Rev. Ohanes Delice, a Seventh-Day Adventist, is the pastor of the church, whose membership consists of Armenian Evangelicals, Assyrian, and Arab-speaking Protestants. On Friday, July 5, we were privileged to worship with the congregation. It was a moving experience for me to stand in the pulpit of a church which is the mother of all Armenian churches, from where many spiritual giants had delivered their messages. I was visibly touched. My message was translated into Turkish and Arabic. In spite of the fact that it was a midweek service, there was a fairly good turnout. Following the service, there was a reception, during which we met some Iraqui and Iranian refugees who had fled their countries. These Christian folks wish to emigrate to the USA. Some of them have relatives in America. During the reception hour, I took a tour of the sanctuary. Both the exterior and interior of the church need repair. 2) The Armenian Evangelical Church of Gedik Pasha. This was the second Armenian Evangelical church, known at one time as the Armenian Evangelical Church of Langa. It was established in 1850 to accommodate the growing number of Armenian Evangelicals in Istanbul. This has been a relatively more active church. And this is the church through which the AMAA has supported the Badanegan Doon, the Touzla Summer Camp, and the Armenian Evangelical School of Istanbul. The church has around forty families, and in recent years has experienced a revival. A few years ago, one of the dynamic young leaders of the church, Mr. Krikor Aghabaloghlou, was able to assemble the different factions together and inspire them to form a government-approved Church Council. Krikor is a bold, enthusiastic, and charismatic figure with a strong vision for the future of the church. He has been witnessig for Christ with extreme courage from the pulpit, and through the media, such as the press, radio, and television. He is already a well-known individual among Armenian and some non-Armenian circles. It seems that he has been successful in uniting the previous factions of the church. We were left with the impression that his relations with the present pastor, Missak Gunay, enable them to work in harmony. At this time, Krikor is protesting, through government officials, the confiscation of the Touzla Summer Camp. It will be a long process until justice is served. Krikor also took me on a tour of the interior and exterior parts of the Gedik Pasha church; he has renovated and painted the basement of the church but there are exterior repairs and renovations which are indispensable, Our 150th-anniversary celebrations were held in the Gedik Pasha church. It was a united celebration and was well attended. The morning service was held from 10:30-11:45; the sanctuary was filled to capacity. There was a complimentary luncheon tendered by the church board in their newly painted social hall. That afternoon, at 2 o' clock, the major celebration was held in the larger worship and activity hall, which was filled to capacity. There were more than three hundred people in attendance, including a number of representatives from non-Armenian churches. The program consisted of speeches and music. As usual, my sermon and afternoon speeches were translated into Turkish. Besides these three celebrations, we had the opportunity to worship and have fellowship with a group of women, who meet once a week in large homes for Bible study and worship. The attendees are mostly Armenian, but there are also Greeks, Assyrians, and even Turks. After worshipping with them, we learned something which I could not imagine in my wildest dreams. There are now Turkish Christian churches - their membership is primarily composed of Muslim Turk converts. This was another phenomenon that moved me tremendously. Maybe, in our lifetime, we may witness a spiritual revival in Turkey. Humanly speaking, this might be an impossible dream, but with God, everything is possible. During my visit to the two churches, I inquired about any early historical documents (minutes, church records, publications, etc.) of the Armenian Evangelical Church. I came across none and, upon asking members of the present and previous boards, I found to my great disappointment that many of these papers were sold as junk at a time when the government was cracking down on Christians. Also, about 40 publications had been loaned to an individual who later claimed that they were stolen from him during a time when he was being questioned by government authorities. It is a great shame that these valuable documents are lost. Besides the churches, we were able to visit the Armenian Patriachate and were accorded the courtesy of a tour by one of their most learned priests, Archbishop Krikor Damadian. We also had the opportunity to visit the former Robert College and Soorp Prgitch Hospital, in addition to spending an afternoon in the 250-year-old historic residence of our veteran Armenian Evangelical, Mr. Kavafian, and an evening with Mr. and Mrs. Hrant Dink, both of whom were students at the Badanegan Doon after being brought from the interior Armenian who publishes a very popular bilingual weekly which extensively reported the activities of the 150th anniversary. The Armenian Evangelical delegation to Istanbul had seven delightful and memorable days in Istanbul, beginning each day with a devotional hour. The group was greatly blessed by their pilgrimage to the birthplace of the Armenian Evangelical Church.","Tootikian, Vahan H",Armenian Reporter International,1996-09-21,0
"Religious Confrontations in a New Play. The latest play, Beata, the Pope's Daughter by Mario Fratti is another confirmation of his talent for feeling the pulse of Western society. By posing thought-provoking and controversial topics of philosophical and social concern. Fratti has exposed the vices and evils of Western civilization in his 47 plays. Fratti does not offer easy solutions, though he exercises his critical judgment. Instead he hopes that the social message he delivers is to be decoded or discovered by an audience. that is sufficiently intelligent and politically and culturally aware as not to accept any mass media brainwashing or political manipulations. Written in the traditions of the realistic European drama (Fratti was born in Italy but has been living in New York since 1963), Beata, the Pope's Daughter focuses on topics of religious ideology as it confronts the conflicting Christian and Muslim worlds views. In this highly polemical play, Fratti puts a discerning eye on the key issues; to what extent Muslim and Christian religions are serving mankind, to what degree the Muslim religion can be used as a justification of political actions of violent nature or whether the Catholic Church should be held responsible for the evils and vices of the Western society. Fratti ambitiously and courageously takes the much controversial question of celibacy in the Catholic priesthood, by expressing a subversive skepticism in the Pope's moral stand. In the notes at the end of the play, Fratti claims that it is based on historical facts, in particular' the attempt on pope John Paul II's life by Ali Agca, who at that time belonged to the Turkish terrorist Muslim organization Gray Wolves. The victim/heroine in the play is a young woman, Beata, living in Vatican City, who finds out that she was conceived by the Pope while he was a young priest in Poland. In a touching scene she tells the Pope that she has found her certificate of baptism revealing the truth about his fatherhood. She also confesses that she is pregnant by a Swiss guard The Pope, without verbally acknowledging his fatherhood, tenderly offers her his love and forgives her for her sin. A multimedia interval shows the attempted assassination of the Pope and the capture of Ali Agca, responsible for the assassination plot. Agca supporters are portrayed as frantic kidnappers of Beata, trying to force her to provide evidence that she is the Pope's daughter and thus discredit not only the Pope but the entire Christian world and Western civilization for its sexual hypocrisy. In the climax, Beata sacrifices herself to preserve the image of the Church and the sanctity of her father, the Pope. However, her child is now taken by the Muslim terrorists to become a fighter for the Muslim cause. In the end, the audience can be well wonder who won - who are the victors and who are the losers, and where do truth and justice lie in the merciless confrontations of religious beliefs. The production of Beata, the Pope's Daughter is now on view at the Theater for the New City until September 22. The key role of the Pope is elegantly portrayed by Dominic Chinese, who is assisted by an able and energetic cast.","Fratti, Mario",Italian Voice,1996-09-19,0
"Governor Signs Important Legislation for New Jersey's Muslim Community in Paterson Governor Christie Whitman on July 12 signed legislation at the United Islamic Center in Paterson at 408 Knickerbocker Avenue, to prevent consumer fraud in the preparation, distribution and sale of food represented as halal. We are all concerned with the food we eat, said Gov. Whitman. We want that food to meet high standards for purity and freshness. We also rely on government to ensure that those who prepare our food meet those standards. Of course, there are even higher standards, to meet. Those are the laws that we follow as part of our religious faith. The Al Quran instructs Muslims to eat `eat which Allah hath bestowed...as food lawful and good, continued the Governor. Today, we are taking a big step in ensuring that all foods represented to be halal meet the standard of `lawful and good. The bill S-460, which was sponsored by Senator John A. Girgenti (D-Passaic) and Assemblyman Alfred E. Steele (D-Passaic) requires any dealer who prepares, distributes, or sells food designated halal, to post that fact conspicuously on the premises at which the food is sold. The Governor explained in her remarks that the halal posting will be required by the Director of the Division of Consumer Affairs, who will specify, the type and size of the sign that a dealer must display for all to see. A dealer means any establishment that advertises or presents itself as selling, preparing, or maintaining food as halal. That includes every food establishment, from a restaurant, butcher shop, or supermarket to a manufacturer.. slaughterhouse, or wholesaler. Also included are summer camps, nursing homes, caterers, bakeries, and delicatessens. The bill, which mirrors the Kosher Food Consumer Protection Act, gives the Division authority to enforce halal food requirements under the consumer fraud law. I have said many times across this great state that we are truly many faces, but one family. We come from so many different backgrounds and cultures. We speak so many languages, carry on so many tradition and celebrate so many faiths, said Gov. Whitman. Signing this legislation bolsters my belief that addressing the needs of one part of our family shows respect and strengths us all. Every member and every community in our one family is important to making our New Jersey the best place in which to live, work and raise a family. added the Governor.",NA,Italian Voice,2000-07-20,0
"Issues and Personality The late President Hafez Assad was born in 1930 in a small village (Kurdaha) into a peasant family of Alawite Muslim faith, a decided minority in Syria. At age 15, the future strongman of Syria was active against the French In a struggle for Syrian self-determination. When Assad was 16, he joined the Socialist Baath Party that eventually assumed his brand of political activity. That same year (1946), Syria gained its independence. Nine years later Assad graduated from the Syrian air force academy and became a fighter pilot for three years from 1958-61, at the same time that Syria and Egypt united as the United Arab Republic. In 1961, Syria and Egypt had a falling out, but Assad, who had received the sobriquet the Lion of Damascus, retained a firm Arab nationalism. When Syria parted ways with Egypt, the powers in Syria excluded him from the in-group. He put his uniform away, but not his leadership. In 1963, when he and other Syrian military staged a bloodless coup, he was rewarded the command of the air force. By 1966, the Baath Party, controlled by the minority Alawites, ousted the government and Assad was named the Minister of Defense. NO PEACE WITHOUT SYRIA The 1967 war with Israel was a disaster for the Syrians. They lost the Golan Heights, which remains a contentious issue, and from which insult the Syrian leader never psychologically recovered. When he seized power in Syria in 1970, his main efforts focused on regaining the Golan Heights and consolidating his power base in his homeland. From that point on, analysts maintained that the Arabs would never militarily defeat Israel without Egypt, but without Syria peace would ever materialize in the area. Assad's antipathy for Israel never wanted, but his strong distrust for the US eased somewhat during the Persian Gulf War when he joined in the coalition with 29,000 Syrian troops against his Arab foe, Saddam Hussein. By 1991, Assad joined Jordan, Lebanon and the Palestinians in the US-brokered peace conference with Israel. However, Assad remained a determined nationalist who wanted every inch of the Golan Heights back from Israel-Syrian talks resumed in the US, but in March Assad's summit meeting in Geneva with President Clinton ended in a deadlock. The Golan Heights issue remains unresolved. It goes without saying that in many negotiations, strong personalities have a decisive bearing on the peace process. This has recently been seen with Presidents Aliyev and Kocharian over Karabagh. It becomes even more critical in communal societies where the issues and the personalities seem to meld and one cannot tell the difference between the personality and the issue. It is a cultural phenomenon. The leaders have a difficult time making the choices that may be necessary to achieve the desired peace, which may be more beneficial to the entire nation than winning the issue. That need has been described as face saving. It often assumes great proportions, which then becomes the dominant problem. THE PROBLEM OF FACE SAVING President Aliyev has recently articulated this phenomenon to the Iranians. The Azeri president stated that Azerbaijan has no problem with establishing normal relations with Armenia, but the sanctity of the integrity of the Azerbaijan borders must be achieved and the refugees must be returned to their original homes. What this means is that President Aliyev probably has no problem with de facto independence for Karabagh, and that living accommodations that would satisfy the refugees would be acceptable. President Aliyev is realistic enough to understand that not too many Azerbaijanis who were expelled from Karabagh are going to be satisfied with returning to their former villages that are predominantly Armenian. This is particularly true if ultimately the Armenians control the political processes in Karabagh, and they would be deciding the fate of the area, regardless of the de facto or de jure status. In Syria, another clear sign of a communal mentality is the designation of Bashar Assad as the heir apparent. He may be exceptionally intelligent, but he has no political experience. The presidency requires exceptional political expertise during a very sensitive phase of the peace process. As the first nation in the Arab world where a presidency became inherited, Syria might be spending an inordinate amount of time looking inward to prevent internal turmoil. It is a precarious time for on-the-job training. On a much lower level this is similar to what happened in Armenia in the aftermath of the murder of Vazken Sarkissian, when his brother Aram was appointed as Prime Minister. Nothing in this article should be interpreted to mean that the culture/communal mentality is the unitary force in the political process. Ultimately, all nations will make decisions based upon their perceived best interests. Just how much the culture impacts on the decisions is arguable. Yet, there is no denying that culture will indeed play a role. The unknown is the matter of degree.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2000-06-24,0
"Common dilemma - common cause New York can make one jaded about numbers: a million people lining the streets for a parade, a half million in Central Park gather to hear a rock concert - what's an additional 10,000 at the United Nations? Yet that number participated in the recent United Nations special session on the status of women throughout the world, known as Beijing+5. If one listened closely to the more than 200 presentations given during the four days and attended even a few of the special panels, it was possible to get a concentrated and fascinating glimpse of what is happening to women in every corner of the globe. And in every corner of the world women had united into trans-national coalitions and organizations to solve similar problems. The panels and country reports on the status of women offered an astounding array of information: dismal - 1.2 billion people in the world live on less than $1 per day and three-fifths of these are women and children; shocking - black markets exist in Asia and Africa where parents sell their girl children for sex and labor; intriguing - women who are not allowed to leave their homes unescorted in some Muslim countries are receiving an education through computers via distance-learning; overwhelming - in some African countries one in four people is infected with the deadly HIV/AIDS virus, decimating entire generations; positive - since the mid-1980s the number of women in political office in Latin America and Western Europe has increased dramatically; and desperately depressing - according to the report by Austria's delegate, approximately 500,000 women each year, seeking employment abroad, are lured out of Central and East European countries under false pretenses to Western Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America as part of the worldwide prostitution trade (the United States estimates that approximately 50,000 of these women arrive here annually). This flight of women from their countries for economic reasons illustrates the dilemma that the East European countries present for the United Nations. The U.N. Division of Statistics includes Ukraine and 19 other East European countries in their category of developed regions. However, the term transition country is used by the U.N. Development Fund for Women - and probably better reflects Ukraine's true status. The official U.N. poverty level is $360 per year - below that is considered destitution - the poorest of poor in U.N. parlance. The average salary in Ukraine is only about $800 per year, not exactly a huge leap from the edge of poverty. However, this level of poverty does not make sense given the high level of education obtained by most people in Ukraine. In U.N. equations, increased levels of education usually lead to increased levels of well-being. A highly educated, literate and trained population and a fairly sophisticated social and political infrastructure combined with economic crisis is a common phenomenon throughout all of Eastern Europe. And, as is common to most economic crises, the brunt in all these countries is being borne by the women and children. Listening to the reports, it became clear that despite progress or steps taken in any one country, because of interdependence and borders, these countries would rise and fall as a region. However, it was also clear that the women of Eastern Europe, unlike women from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, even Europe and North America, were not used to working together, had no regional coalition, told a similar tale, but one by one. The next special session is scheduled for 2005. Let's hope that the women of Eastern Europe recognize their common dilemma and create a coalition that tells their tale, hopefully a better one by then, in unity.",NA,Ukrainian Weekly,2000-06-18,0
"Ukrainian delegation participates in U.N. session on gender equality by Irene Jarosewich UNITED NATIONS - Leading a delegation of 10 women that included representatives from both government and non-government sectors, Ukraine's Minister of Justice Suzanna Stanik delivered the Ukrainian government's summary statement on the current status of women in Ukraine at the opening session of the 23rd United Nations General Assembly special session, Women 2000: Gender Equality, Development and Peace for the 21st Century. In her comments, delivered the morning of June 5, Ms. Stanik stated: We are entering the new century, the century of humanism and rule of law. Military measures for solving human problems have been fully exhausted. There is a rising need for modernization of the world by addressing the global social and political changes on the basis of generally recognized morals and ethics, as well as legal principles: democracy, human rights, equality, justice, freedom and humanism. It is not incidental that the first special session of the General Assembly in the new 21st century is devoted to the elaboration of effective strategies for the advancement of women all over the world, the creation of appropriate conditions for their life, the enhancement of their role in political and economic activities. ... it is the woman who personifies civil, moral and human approach to addressing the most complex problems of the modern world. (The full text of Ms. Stanik's statement appears on page 3.) Portugal's Minister for Equality Maria de Belem Roseira, representing the European Union, also spoke during the opening session on June 5 and stated that gender equality, sustainable development and peace are fundamental objectives, all of them interlinked, to be achieved in the 21st century ... the objective of building gender equality ... is not just a matter of fairness and justice to women ... but, above all, is a matter of democracy and human rights for all. The U.N. special session, held June 5-9 and known popularly as Beijing +5, is a follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women that was held in 1995 in Beijing. The 1995 conference developed an international agenda for the advancement of women, The Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action, a plan that was adopted unanimously by representatives from 189 states. Attending the Beijing +5 special session in New York were close to 10,000 participants, including 2,300 delegates, 2,100 NGO representatives, U.N. staff, media correspondents, experts, panelists and speakers. Of the U.N. member-states, 178 sent representatives to deliver five-year status reports on their countries' activities in implementing the platform for action adopted in Beijing. Also giving presentations were 28 heads of international bodies, U.N. commissions, nonmember and observer states. Seventy-seven percent of the speakers delivering presentations during the 10 plenary sessions were women. The status reports reflected progress made by countries in the 12 critical areas identified in the Beijing final document as obstacles to women's advancement: poverty; lack of access to education and training; inadequate health care; violence; armed conflict; lack of economic power; lack of political power and decision-making authority; inadequate institutional mechanisms to ensure advancement; inadequate safeguarding of human rights; poor access to the media and new information technologies; environmental hazards; abuse of the girl-child. Violence against women appeared frequently in the reports and it became clear throughout the week that, though poverty is an enormous problem for women, the incidence of violence against women worldwide is overwhelming. Examples of violence that specifically targeted women included: international trafficking of women, most recently women from Eastern Europe, who are held against their will to work as prostitutes; in certain Asian countries girls as young as 9 are sold as slaves; in some African countries genital mutilation of young women is still practiced; in many Muslim countries the killing of a woman to defend a man's sense of honor (so-called honor killings) is still condoned; wife-beating is not illegal and in fact is socially accepted in a great number of countries; women and girls are victims of rape by invading soldiers in dozens of regional conflicts. During her presentation on Thursday, June 8, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who headed the U.S. delegation, stated: when a woman is raped, beaten, or mutilated it is not cultural, it is criminal; and no government ... can deny its responsibility to stop these crimes. She later added, [The United States] launched a major diplomatic and law enforcement initiative to halt trafficking in human beings. This rapidly growing criminal enterprise has gone global, distorting economies, degrading societies, endangering neighborhoods and robbing millions, mostly women and children, of their dreams. ... we are forging partnerships on every continent to share information, coordinate legal actions and find and close criminal networks. ... I invite everyone here to join in a multi-year, multi-national effort to win the fight against trafficking. The final document from the special session, released on June 12, placed special emphasis on actions to be taken by governments and international organizations to reduce violence against women. The topic of the economic empowerment of women, finding solutions to lift women out of poverty, was addressed in part on June 5 with a three-hour panel, chaired by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, on micro-credit programs - the granting of small loans, no more than several thousand dollars, to begin a business. Micro-credit programs target people who have no collateral and, therefore, usually are denied start-up business loans by traditional banks. The micro-credit program has proved to be internationally successful in helping people achieve financial stability and independence, and about 75 percent of the close to 14 million people that have received micro-credit loans in the past five years worldwide have been women. (Also on June 5, President Bill Clinton, while on a six-hour visit to Kyiv, introduced a new micro-credit initiative, funded by the United States, to begin this year in Ukraine.) Receiving special emphasis in several panels was the mandate to improve the political empowerment of women. A new initiative was launched by the international organization Women's Environment and Development Organization titled 50-50 by 2005: Get the Balance Right! Though women are about 50 percent of the world's population, only an average of 13 percent of the legislators worldwide and only 7.5 percent of government ministers are women. In Ukraine less than 8 percent of the parliamentarians are women, placing Ukraine in the middle third of East European countries and the bottom third of 180 countries worldwide according to information from the U.N. Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Among the delegation members from Ukraine attending the U.N. special session were Dr. Iryna Holubieva, head of the Division of Family and Women's Affairs at the State Committee on Youth Policy, Sports and Tourism, and Halyna Honcharuk, coordinator of the Kyiv Center for Women's Issues. Dr. Holubieva noted that she learned a great deal from the country reports and, furthermore, was impressed with the determination with which women from many Asian, African and Latin American countries pursue solutions to the problems facing women in their countries. She suggested that their assertiveness and their willingness to admit and confront problems offers a valuable lesson to women in Ukraine. She also noted that Ukraine's women are among the most highly educated in the world (according to a recent UNIFEM report, in 1996, 95 percent of young adult women in Ukraine received a secondary education) and therefore could be, and should be, living better. She commented that she was impressed with the number of countries -15 in Western Europe alone - that have high-level government commissions or ministries devoted exclusively to issues pertaining to women and children, and for developing programs in keeping with the critical areas identified in the Beijing action plan; she noted that a similar entity should be established in Ukraine. Ms. Honcharuk attended several panels, including one on women and violence. She commented that she was extremely impressed with the number of men who participated in the panel and spoke out in support of programs and policies to stop violence against women in all forms and the necessity to elevate women in all aspects of society in order to achieve gender equality. She recalled that she particularly enjoyed the presentation by a group of men from Canada on a conference they had organized on gender equality and promised to take the idea back to Ukraine. She stated that the activities of her center in Kyiv are completely funded by the mayor's office and the City Council, and believes that in Kyiv there is great support and understanding among local officials for the issues confronting women.

"Gevork Kherlopian Speaks at NAASR on Origins of Armenian Christianity Dr. Gevork Kherlopian spoke on the early history of Christianity in Armenia in a lecture on May 4, 2000 at the Center and Headquarters of the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research here. Kherlopian has had a long and distinguished academic career in Armenia, Lebanon, and the United States and has published widely on Armenian history, theology, philosophy, and sociology. The May 4 event was his first time participating in the NAASR lecture series. ARMENIAN CHRISTIANITY OF INTERNATIONAL IMPORTANCE Kherlopian's focus in the lecture was on Christianity in Armenia before the official state conversion in 301 A.D. While Armenian Christianity after the conversion had been well studied, the introduction of the faith into Armenian lands and its early growth are broadly disputed issues, said Kherlopian. A scholar of this era is faced with the difficulties of sitting through various sources with highly varying degrees of reliability: Kherlopian has drawn on church histories, Biblical and non-canonical writings, folklore, and oral traditions as recorded by early Armenian writers such as Agathangelos. Kherlopian pointed out that the acceptance of Christianity in Armenia has a very deep international significance and importance; it is not only important for the Armenian people. Although today most of the Middle East is Muslim, this was not always the case; and the legalization of Christianity, or rather the penetration of Christianity in Armenia, was one of the basic factors in the Christianizing of the East. Unlike the Roman or Byzantine Empires. Armenian Christian states ere not imperialistic, and if not for the defense of Christianity mounted by St. Vartan Mamigonian at the Battle of Avarayr in 451 A.D. the growth of: Christianity in the region as a whole would have suffered, Kherlopian feels. EARLIEST EXPOSURE TO CHRISTIAN TEACHINGS The first century and more of Christianity is still shrouded in mystery. Little is known for certain, and much of what we think we know is speculative. Dr. Kherlopian explained that, at the time of the Crucifixion, it was thought that there were no more than 700 people who could have been considered Christians, and there were no Christian communities. Christianity, as we understand it, began to develop after the events of the Pentecost described in the Acts of the Apostles. Following this event, which was attended by Jews from many lands which were heavily populated with Armenians, such as Cappadocia, Parthia, and Cilicia, word began to spread when these diasporan Jews returned to their homes. It is known that there was a substantial Jewish presence in Armenia from the time of the Babylonian exile and particularly from the time of Tigran the Great around 100 B.C.; so there was doubtless communication between these Jewish communities and the Jews who first heard Christ's teachings. In addition, much of St. Paul's missionary work was done in regions where there are Armenians, such as Antioch and Cilicia. Kherlopian surmises that, in light of these potential connections and the well-established ties between the rulers of these lands and the rulers of Armenia, it is only logical that information about Christianity came to Armenia very early. ARMENIA PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT FAITH? Regarding the reasons why Christianity took root in Armenia, Kherlopian feels that Armenia was predisposed to accept the new religion. There was no monolithic faith in Armenia before the conversion (and as Prof. James Russell and others have shown, even after the conversion aspects of the old beliefs remained), since Armenia had gone through ages of worship of native gods, Persian gods, the Greek pantheon, and Zoroastrian gods, to list the most prominent pre-Christian religions which were prevalent in Armenia. Thus, it was not unprecedented for the nation to change religion. Although Kherlopian did not dismiss the traditional belief that Christianity was introduced into Armenia by the Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew, he pointed out that other nations claim that Thaddeus came to their land as well and that is common for multiple claims to be made regarding the apostles. This does not negate the possible truth of the tradition, but it forces us to examine it more closely. In conclusion, Kherlopian observed that he was presenting only a small part of the work he has done in recent years on the subject of early Christianity in Armenia and that on that matter, the work he has done is the smallest part of the work that remains to be done. Following the lecture there was a lengthy question-and-answer period, during which audience members explored other important topics, including the controversial role of women in the Armenian Church, both in early times and today. The consensus was that the topic of the early Armenian Church is one which is not easily exhausted. After the question-and-answer period, refreshments were served, and the audience was given the opportunity to speak to Kherlopian one-on-one.

"PERISCOPE: Refugee Issue A Major Crisis By Niall O'Dowd THE violent clash between black and white residents erupted in Parnell Street late last night. Customers in the Blue Lion pub and staff in the Nigerian shop, Infinity Ventures, hurled bottles and glasses across the road at one another. Gardai (police) questioned a number of people but no arrests were made. Eyewitnesses say that the trouble began when a man came out of the pub and shouted racist abuse at a black man sitting in a car. -- RTE News, Tuesday, May 2 DUBLIN - The first thing you notice in Ireland these days is the number of black and dark skinned people walking the streets. In my hometown of Drogheda, an old industrial city just 30 miles from Dublin, foreign faces were as rare as winter swallows in my youth. Nowadays they are commonplace. Now I could walk across the main thoroughfare West Street and see several different nationalities ranging from African blacks to Asians to Eastern Europeans. My wife, who could be mistaken for Spanish, was asked at a bank machine if she spoke English, an unheard of query just a few years ago. The presence of foreigners in Drogheda and towns all over Ireland has ignited a fierce debate that rages on the airwaves and in the newspapers. Some of the newspapers, especially the tabloids, are deliberately exploitative, making huge headlines out of any incidents in which refugees are involved. There are thousands of asylum seekers in Ireland at present, from Eastern Europe and African countries. In addition, there are huge numbers of illegal immigrants drawn to the Celtic Tiger from countries all over the world. The monocultural Ireland of the past is no more. Latvians, Romanian gypsies, Nigerian emigres, Kosovar refugees, and Asian job seekers now dot the cities and towns of Ireland in a way that no one could have foreseen even a few years ago. You will see the headscarfed Muslim women selling the magazine The Big Issue all over Dublin and the larger cities. It is a publication usually sold by homeless people, but the illegal immigrants are desperate for any paying work. In every hotel there are foreign workers, dark skinned Spanish, black chambermaids, and Eastern European handymen. Conversations in pubs are often carried out in two or three different languages. Ireland is ushering in an era of multiculturalism. Outside the pub little children of the emigres beg for whatever scraps are thrown from the Celtic Tiger's table. The lead story in last Saturday's Irish Times said it all. Ireland's leading Muslim cleric denounced the government's asylum policies, particularly the latest plan to separate asylum seekers and send them to small communities all over Ireland. Most Irish were probably unaware until last week that there was an Imam or Muslim holy man in Ireland who spoke for his ever-growing constituency. Equally, other religions are beginning to be heard, such as Eastern orthodox Christians and evangelical African sects. Chinese Buddhists are creating their own spiritual realities. Ireland is becoming a mini Tower of Babel. The reaction of the natives is mixed, to say the least. The government is not helping with a ham-fisted policy of scattering the asylum seekers throughout the country, often into small communities with little consultation and where there are little or no resources for them. Because they cannot work while they are seeking asylum, the refugees are forced to do nothing during the days. In isolated Irish villages, where 40 asylum seekers in a community of, say, 400 can make a big difference, that utterly alters the local landscape. There is also a fast growing nativist strain among many of the Irish. Ireland for the Irish is a phrase I heard continuously on radio and television from people phoning in to talk shows when I was there. Some of the villagers affected are demanding that the refugees take AIDS tests, and that they be checked for criminal records. It is the kind of inflammatory rhetoric, aided and abetted by irresponsible elements in the media, which is quickly making a bad situation worse. It is ironic, of course, to speak as an Irish emigrant to the U.S., where nativist sentiment not so long ago sought to ensure that No Irish Need Apply in this country. In Ireland today there are many who are seeking to ensure that No Foreigners Need Apply at a time when Ireland desperately needs more labor. Unfortunately, too many people have amnesia when it comes to their own history, and only relate to their present experiences. Rather like the bussing crisis in Boston, there is also a liberal establishment that is decrying the narrow-mindedness of others, yet who are ensuring that the refugees are placed nowhere near their pristine neighborhoods. It is a difficult problem which Ireland faces, and one that will not be resolved easily. The first priority must be to establish a proper and compassionate immigration policy, which is notably lacking. The reality is that Ireland needs about 70,000 workers at present to fill jobs in the marketplace. It should not be too difficult to set up a proper skills-based immigration policy that will also recognize the plight of those fleeing persecution in other countries. Ireland needs to learn from the American experience that immigration is a spur, not a hindrance, to prosperity.

"The Meaning of April 24, 1915 - Revelations of Dr. Taner Akcam I had read a lot about Dr. Taner Akcam, the dissident Turkish historian, but I wanted to directly hear his views about the Armenian deportations, massacres, and the final solution to the Armenian Question. He struck me as an intelligent, honest and well-read historian having specialized in sociology and having recently ventured into the thorny subject of Human Rights and the Armenian Question, which he labels as Turkish Denial of the Genocide: Taboo or Social Hysteria. During the reception at Hye Doon in Palisades Park, New Jersey, it was a pleasure to exchange views in general and, in particular, issues pertaining to Armenian-Turkish relations. He was asked, How come Turkish authorities are letting you present your controversial discussions on this issues, as was the case in the conference at Mersin University, Turkey or permitting the printing of your book on the same subject? Realizing that we both were the products of the Turkish educational system and grew up under the Turkish military regime, his reply was plain and simple: I wonder about that myself. THORNY ISSUE We both know that, without the consent of the Turkish National Security Agency, one cannot openly discuss the thorny issue of the Armenian Genocide in public; therefore, one should be careful when a Turk is permitted by the Turkish government to debate the Armenian Genocide openly. Akcam stated that he feels like a donkey in the minefield. What he means is, by venturing into the dangerous subject of the Armenian Question and the Genocide, he risks sanctions, threats and arrest. Akcam is a brave former leftist revolutionary, who was once arrested and incarcerated in prison with his friends for criticizing the Turkish government's excesses and human rights violations. It is true that from 1960 to 1990, on and off, thousands of leftist university students tried to challenge the Turkish military regime and facism, by advocating human rights to the citizens, cultural rights to minorities like Kurds, Laz and Cherkez, and religious tolerance to Alawis, Christians and others. Most of them were persecuted, incarcerated and even killed by nationalist vigilantes stationed on university campuses, pretending to be students; most of them, in fact, were government informants or on the interior ministry's payroll. Many young idealist students' lives were ruined for their beliefs and convictions in the cause of democracy an social justice and were silenced in brutality. COMMITTED TO DEMOCRACY & HUMAN RIGHTS Taner and his friends were able to dig out of a tunnel and escape from prison. His commitment to democracy and human rights was further strengthened in prison and he became determined, more than ever, to expose the Turkish government's fascism. The militaristic and racist mentality, which was responsible for he demise of the Armenians in Anatolia in 1915-23, and the oppression and persecution of the Kurds since 1923, is still a menace today to leftist and political dissidents and human-rights advocates. Dr. Taner Akcam's writings, lectures, and presentations emphasize the following fundamental facts that should be read carefully by certain revisionist Armenian historians who are questioning the premeditated and preplanned nature of the Armenian Genocide, calling the act a wartime response. Akcam presents facts, documents, and quotations from Ottoman officials, civil servants an citizens to the effect that the Armenian Genocide was planned, encouraged an executed by the highest echelons of the Ottoman government. Gendarmes and some military personnel also actively participated in the process of wholesale massacres and looting (It is a known fact that all Armenian conscripts in the Ottoman Army were murdered by their comrades - MA. He acknowledges that the Pan-Turkish leaders' aim was the elimination of the Armenian race in Anatolia to make room for Muslim Turks, only in order to create a homogeneous Turkish state. He agrees that one of the main reasons for the Ottoman Empire's entry into war was the Turkish leaders' determination not to implement reforms in the Armenian provinces as mandated by the international treaties of San Stefano and Berlin. Therefore, the Ottoman Empire's entry into WWI created an opportunity to solve the Armenian Question with deportation and massacres as preplanned. They used the Ottoman army's defeat in Sarikamish as a pretext and later blamed the Armenians for complicity and collaboration with the Russian enemy. COURT-MARTIAL EVIDENCE CITED He used the evidence from the postwar military court martial proceeding in Istanbul as proof that the Ottoman officials in the highest echelons were directly involved directly in the Armenian Genocide. Yet, Dr. Akcam questions the sincerity of the postwar Ottoman Military Tribunal's proceedings against the organizers of the Armenian Genocide and he admits that there was reluctance by the prosecutor's office to prosecute all the criminals. Dr. Akcam admits that most of the culprits were intentionally allowed to escape to Anatolia to join Kermalist nationalist forces in order towage a war of independence against the occupying ally forces between 1919 and 1923. It is a fact that, at the time of the Nationalist movement in Ankara, which was led by Mustafa Kemal, there were deliberate efforts by the Ottoman government to delay persecution of all the criminals. Only a handful of the lower-echelon perpetrators were punished by hanging, mainly in order to eliminate their witness against the highest echelons. Prominent CUP members, like Sukru Kaya, Ahmet Esat Uras, Tefik Rustu Aras, Salih Bozok, Recep Peker, Omer Naci, Mithat Sukru, Ali Cetnikaya, Ahmet Riza, Nihat Rest, Nurettin Pasha, Mustafa Ismet other segment also believes that it was unjust to kill all women and children yet they try to justify it, stating that the Armenians also did the same to Turks. The third category is the young generation residing in the western section of Turkey. When asked What happened to the Armenians?, they will ask you, What Armenians?, since they are not informed! Akcam knows well that the Turkish military, which controls the whole political life in Turkey, is made up of nationalist elements who will never agree that what happened to the Armenians was genocide, and they will continue to deny it, as discussed above. Akcam sincerely believes that what happened to the Armenians and what the Turkish nationalists did to them is no longer an Armenian or Turkish issue; since a crime of genocide was committed, this should be considered a crime against humanity. His response is unambiguous on this issue. VALUE OF TURKISH-ARMENIAN DIALOG However, the question now is the value of his advocacy for establishing a dialogue between Armenian and Turkish intellectuals and historians at the grass-roots level. How far can both sides go when the Turkish military, the only force in Turkey, is not only denying the Armenian Genocide but justifying it with its official Publications propaganda campaign with hired lobbyists in major world Capitals, from Washington to Paris, from London to Tel-Aviv. It is obvious that the Turkish military rulers are determined to deny the Armenian Genocide in the future as well. Tamer Akcam agrees with this assessment. This is why he is advocating a person-to-person approach, hoping that someday relations may change. Well, the Turkish government already knows that Armenia is a reality. Although the Turks refuse to establish diplomatic relations, they are testing the waters by permitting personal contacts between civilians. As it was in the case of the Chicago conference, where a handful of Armenians and Turks met to exchange views and presented papers analyzing Armenian-Turkish relations without releasing a joint written statement acknowledging the Armenian Genocide. Turkish historians are currently studying in St. Petersburg, Russia and learning the Armenian language and history, with the intent to establish an Armenian chair at Ankara University. With the government's blessing, an unofficial Turkish-Armenian Chamber of Commerce has been formed by a handful of Turkish and Armenian businessmen. Putting these token efforts aside, the Turkish government continues to arm Azerbaijan, forge a military alliance with Azerbaijan and Georgia, refuses to life the blockade, and conducts anti-Armenian propaganda with its broadcasts aimed at the Caucasian and Central Asian populace. Turkey continues to pressure Israel to use its influence in Washington to undermine Armenian lobbying efforts. Turkey is trying to exclude Armenia from the oil pipeline projects, regional economic pacts and cooperation. THANKS TO DR. AKCAM Taking all these facts into consideration, we should thank Dr. Taner Akcam for stimulating our minds, giving us an opportunity to see the dangers as well as the right set of circumstances. It is the conviction of most that if Turkey is ready to accept the European Union's standards as a candidate member, it has to adopt a real democracy, accept responsibilities and acceptabilities for past offenses, and commit itself to human rights and European values. Without these changes the Turkish government's efforts to test the waters with Armenian individuals or representatives will not go beyond an aesthetic goodwill gesture. Furthermore, they may even be considered a sinister effort to divide Armenians. We are already seeing the repercussions in the form of a looming disaster in the SAS (Society of Armenian Studies) where two ambitious Armenian students of history are falsely accusing two well-established Armenian professors of history of racism and anti-Semitism. They are disseminating accusatory misinformation and passing it through Turkish and Jewish academic circles. So far, their motivation remains unclear. Finally, let's turn to the meaning of April 24, 1915. The Armenian Genocide issue is more than man's inhumanity against man; it is not only a crime against Mankind; it is also a financial compensation issue - and what scares the Turkish nationalists the most - it is a territorial issue as well. After all, the Genocide was premeditated, preplanned and executed to acquire Armenian lands and properties, and permanently bury the promised reform program under international obligation in the six Armenian provinces, once and for all. This is why the Turks are trying to test the waters, attempting to establish an unofficial dialog between Armenians and Turks at a grassroots level without any political implications, to finalize the thorny Armenian Question.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-04-22,0
"Helsinki Commission hearing airs concerns about press freedoms by Chadwick R. Gore WASHINGTON - The trend toward state-controlled media and the erosion of the most fundamental right of citizens in a democracy - freedom of speech - in a number of countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union is perilous for our neighbors in Europe, said Commission Chairman Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) at the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe hearing on The Deteriorating Freedom of Media and Speech in OSCE Countries. While we have condemned recent events - the arrest of Andrei Babitsky, journalists' arrests in Turkey, and the assassination of Slavko Curuvija in Serbia - the totality of threats to the media and private speech was brought into full view today, he said at the April 4 hearing Members of the commission will join me in asking Secretary [of State Madeleine K.] Albright to address freedom of expression issues with governments in Central Asia when she visits next week. We want her to express our shared concerns in the most public and expressive way possible, so that the people of each country in the region know the American people stand behind them in their struggle for freedom and against tyranny. In July the U.S. delegation to the OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Bucharest, Romania, will also raise these concerns with our parliamentary colleagues. OSCE states have each committed themselves to democracy as the best form of government, a form that fails without free press and speech, said Smith. Another commission member, Rep. Joseph R. Pitts said, When raising concerns about violations of freedom of speech, it is vital that we not only address the effect on the media. As we know from numerous other Commission hearings, religious believers in Eastern and Western Europe and Central Asia have been imprisoned for publicly stating their religious beliefs. In Uzbekistan we have seen reports that on March 8 Uzbek police confiscated reports published by Human Rights Watch that were carried by one of their representatives who was monitoring the trial of 12 men charged with membership in Hizb-ut-Takhrir, a peaceful Muslim organization banned in Uzbekistan. The problems for religious individuals or groups are limited not only to speaking about their views person-to-person, but also speaking through the media. Testimony before the Helsinki Commission was delivered by: David W. Yang, senior coordinator for democracy promotion, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. State Department; Freimut Duve, OSCE representative on freedom of the media; Thomas A. Dine, president, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty; Linda K. Foley, president, Newspaper Guild-Communications Workers of America and vice-president, International Federation of Journalists; Emma E.D.

Discussing the U.S. commitment to media freedom, Mr. Yang pointed out that The strength of our commitment is, first and foremost, demonstrated in our bilateral diplomacy. Every day the State Department speaks out, both in public and private, against any and all violations of freedom of speech and the media. Mr. Duve explained, My office has been involved in freedom of expression issues in many OSCE participating states, including Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Uzbekistan, Romania, the Russian Federation, the Slovak Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Ukraine and in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia ... and it is a bleak picture. Mr. Dine warned, The possibility of the emergence of a free media in the post-Communist countries is threatened by a combination of three factors: government efforts to restrict or even suppress media freedom; survival of Communist era attitudes about the press among officials, the population, and even journalists; and some unintended and unexpected consequences of the transition period itself. Both the extent of each and the mix of all three of these factors, of course, vary widely ... I believe it is most useful here to consider them as a syndrome affecting almost all of them, rather than to examine each of the many countries of this region individually. Ms. Foley was somewhat critical of the role of the OSCE representative, saying in part, We have been following the work of the OSCE representative for media freedom, Mr. Friemut Duve, and the annual report for 1998-1999. Although it includes a long list of interventions and visits, our view is that it does not provide clear and comprehensive strategies in support of independent journalism. Because the OSCE representative often develops strategies on his own without coordinating with journalists' organizations in the affected countries, the OSCE's efforts have not been as effective as they could have been. Instead of operating independently, we believe the OSCE representative should support programs and activities developed jointly by all journalists' organizations and professional groups that are striving for change within the new democracies, Ms. Foley explained. Mr. Duve rejected the criticism, citing his selective approach to media issues, and explaining his involvement with all groups in a given country. Ms. Gray, in her testimony, noted: In the course of the past 10 years, we have documented a total of 153 journalists killed in the line of duty in OSCE countries. That is just over a third of the total of 458 journalists killed, and is a figure we see reflected again in the latest statistics we have: in 1999 almost a third of the 34 journalists killed died in OSCE countries. The number of journalists killed is the most dramatic barometer of press freedom, she contined. Less headline-grabbing forms of attack which the CPJ records are: legal action, including fines and imprisonment; threats or physical attacks on journalists or news facilities; censorship; and harassment, which includes denying journalists access to information, denying them visas to travel for their work, or confiscating or damaging their materials. We also document cases of journalists missing, kidnaped, or expelled from a country. We do believe that one of the most effective methods of improving the conditions in which journalists work in OSCE countries is to shine a very public light on attacks on the press, Ms. Grey underlined. Ms. Greene commented, Our primary focus is on the ways in which international institutions - such as the OSCE, the United Nations, UNESCO, Council of Europe and the European Union - influence press freedom in the world. ...These institutions wield great power, often merely through the moral authority of their resolutions or statements. These words can be forces for freedom and democracy - or they can provide cover for authoritarians seeking justification for restrictions on the free flow of information. I wish I could say that freedom of expression and of the press is thriving in the 55 nations participating in the OSCE. Sadly, I cannot. Chairman Smith closed the hearing explaining that this was the first in a series of hearings on this issue.

"Another Crack Made in Wall of Silence at Genocide Workshop in Chicago, IL: Armenian Genocide Subject of Chicago Workshop Some of the most prominent scholars of Turkish history and society gathered from March 17 to 19 at the University of Chicago for a workshop on the Armenian Genocide. The workshop represented an important, if tentative, step forward in the effort to end the exclusion of the Genocide from the mainstream of Turkish historiography. It was organized by the distinguished historian and political scientist Ronald Grigor Suny. The central project was best articulated toward the end of the workshop by Professor Geoff Eley of the University of Michigan, a historian of the Third Reich. Professor Eley noted that until some twenty years ago, historians of Nazism generally avoided dealing with the Holocaust, but today the Holocaust is seen as the central event of mid-twentieth century German history. Likewise, English history used to be silent about the Irish famine; the breaking of that silence has had important consequences for political life and culture in England. Eley saw the Chicago workshop as an important step in the direction of a similar integration of the Armenian Genocide as a central event in the formation of the Turkish state. Through coercion and rewards, the Turkish state is obviously trying hard to keep the Armenian Genocide out of Turkish historiography, to maintain what is sometimes called a wall of silence. Although Professor Eley's examples do not address the role of the state, they do represent the desired outcome. The examples also show that the dismantling of national myths has become an important project for historians. It should come as no surprise, then, that a growing number of students of Turkish history are addressing the Armenian Genocide. BACKGROUND The first important cracks in the wall of silence came with the work of Taner Akcam and of Fikret Adanir. Dr. Akcam, a sociologist based in Germany, wrote a book about the Armenian Genocide and argued that Turkish society must face its demons to heal itself. (The argument, it should be noted, is primarily an appeal to self-interest.) Professor Adanir, who holds the chair in Ottoman history at Bochum University, Germany, included the Armenian Genocide in his textbook on Ottoman and Turkish history. At a conference on the Armenian Genocide held at the Sorbonne in April 1998, Professor Adanir spoke movingly of his journey from denial to acknowledgment of the Genocide. The fundamental move from individual acts of courage to an organized engagement of the two fields of Turkish history and Armenian Genocide studies came in an exchange in the journal Armenian Forum. Ara Sarafian and the author of this report, as editors of the journal, invited two prominent historians of the Ottoman Empire to respond to an article on the Armenian Genocide. Thus, Engin Akarli, holder of an endowed chair in history at Brown University, and Selim Deringil, a professor of history at Bogazici University in Istanbul, joined Genocide scholar Dr. Vahakan Dadrian in responding to an article by Professor Suny. The encounter succeeded in raising new issues and casting new light on both the Armenian Genocide and the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It was a major blow to the wall of silence. It made every bit of sense, then, to build on that initiative - and that is what the Chicago workshop has done. PARTICIPANTS Professors Akarli and Deringil presented papers at the Chicago workshop, as did Dr. Akcam (now affiliated with Stiftung zu Förderung von Wissenschaft und Kultur, Hamburg). Other senior scholars of Turkish studies who presented papers were Professors Caglar Keyder (Bogazici University), Halil Berktay (Sabanci University), and Müge Goçek (University of Michigan). Scholars of Turkish studies who presented papers also included Professor Holly Shissler (University of Chicago), Seteney Shami (Social Science Research Council), Hakan Özoglu (University of Chicago), and Marc Baer (University of Chicago). From the Armenian studies field, Dr. Gerard J. Libaridian, Professor Suny, and Aram Arkun (Zohrab Center, New York) presented papers. Professor Kevork Bardakjian (University of Michigan) also made a presentation. Discussants included Professor Eley, Professor Cornell Fleischer (University of Chicago), Professor Robert Melson (Purdue University), and Professor Rashid Khalidi (University of Chicago). The workshop was organized by Ronald Suny and a committee consisting of Professor Gocek, Professor Bardakjian, Professor Stephanie Platz (University of Michigan), and Ken Church (University of Michigan). KEY POINTS The workshop, regrettably, was closed-door. Thus it would be unfair to report in great detail who said what. A conference report is being prepared by the organizers, however, and many of the papers will appear in print before long. It is possible, nonetheless, to discuss some general themes. The main points that were explored were historiographic. In other words, they related to how historians do their craft rather than to the actual findings they present. (1) Contextualization and normalization Genocide cannot be considered the normal, or understandable response to any crisis. Thus one problem that historians have to face is how to explain without justifying, comprehend without forgiving. Professors Keyder and Berktay were among the participants who expressed concern that an effort to contextualize can end up normalizing extraordinary events. The workshop did not find answers to this fundamental problem, but the participants were obviously committed to avoiding normalization. (2) Essentialization Everyone spoke against essentialization, i.e., taking a phenomenon out of the context of time, place, and circumstances and treating it as if its characteristics hold universally. An example is speaking of Islam as if every Muslim can be expected to act in similar ways whether in seventh-century Arabia or twenty-first-century Spain. The same goes for looking at history as if nations have always existed and always commanded the primary loyalty of members of national groups. They have not. It is important to avoid projecting backward and imagining that people have always thought of themselves as Armenians and Turks, that these words have always meant the same things to people, and that people have had the same hostilities, loyalties, and motives across time. Of course, thinking of people today as Turkish scholars or Armenian historians is also a way of essentializing - and wrong. To say Turkish historian is to subsume in the same category the person who has been jailed and persecuted for speaking out and the filthy bastard who lies and falsifies and kills memory. It implies an expectation that every Turk is on some level a representative of Turkey and obliged to make excuses for his or her compatriots and ancestors - or to take pride in them. To believe that, incidentally, is to believe that the demand for Turkish recognition of the Armenian Genocide is doomed to failure. (3) National Myths and the Genocide The founding myth of the Turkish state denies not only the Armenian Genocide but the very existence of the non-Turks in Asia Minor. The official history establishment in Turkey tries to reproduce the national myth. The job of honest scholars is to question and correct and debunk. A question with which the participants grappled is how to move from academic tracts to popular consciousness. Here, again, the workshop had no answers; but the participants did have a commitment to move beyond the ivory tower. Professor Keyder made the point that people have a vested interest in adhering to the nationalist myth; it is not only a question of identity but also of the dubious inheritance of material goods. Another important point in this regard was made by Professor Akarli: confronted with irrefutable facts, people sometimes make excuses. Present the Turkish public with overwhelming evidence of the mass destruction of Armenians and the response could well be, Someone was going to be squeezed out of Asia Minor and if `we' hadn't pushed them out, they would have pushed `us' out. This possibility (which has always been part of the official line) must be addressed in the effort to incorporate the Armenian Genocide into Turkish national consciousness. A corollary of this point is that confronting the denial of the Armenian Genocide has become central to the diaspora-Armenian identity. An unhealthy situation holds in which Dr. Libaridian noted, some people have a vested interest in the continuation of denial. Other issues that were discussed were less historiographical and more historical. Here, in fairness to participants, it is probably best to let their papers speak for themselves when published. Some highlights: Professor Shissler made a credible case that Young Turk leaders were not all that certain about the extent of their territorial ambitions; Professor Keyder made a fascinating argument on the question of popular participation in the Genocide; and Professor Berktay brilliantly analyzed popular literature (rather than the work of remote theorists like Gökalp) as agent of nationalist mobilization. Also, Professor Deringil showed how documents can be misused and misconstrued without the falsification of archives. Özoglu tracked the transformation of Kurdish society. Arkun presented one of the most painstakingly researched pieces, dealing with the aftermath of the Genocide in Northern Cilicia. His presentation was a reminder of the need for nitty-gritty research to support all the analysis that goes on in discussions of the Genocide. EVALUATION The workshop was excellent and Professor Suny and his committee are to be congratulated for an important contribution to scholarship and society. In the interests of keeping the project on track, I will allow myself a few words of constructive criticism. The organizers appeared to view the workshop as a revolutionary step, an unprecedented first, tentative meeting of Turkish and Armenian scholars. Unlike, say, the exchange in Armenian Forum, the workshop was not organized around questions to be explored - whatever the nationality of the scholars; rather it was organized to raise questions for future research. A consequence of this misunderstanding was that the workshop did not fully live up to its potential. Scholars in the field have been meeting and reading each other's work for years and know each other. For them, this was not a fragile first step. The fact is that every major scholar there was already on record as having condemned Turkish nationalist historiography. Every one (except to my knowledge Professors Deringil and Gocek) was on record as having spoken openly about the Armenian Genocide. Thus it should have come as no surprise that the conversation moved quickly to a condemnation of Turkish nationalist mythmaking and a condemnation of the denial of the Genocide. To those unaware of the background, the workshop seemed at that moment like a big success - one that ought not be squandered. And thus there was more timidity than appropriate gusto in exploring the questions that arose. It would be unfair to criticize the organizers without saying something about Armenian Genocide scholars who were invited and refused to attend. Of course, no one has to engage in a debate as to whether there was a genocide. But looking at the names on the roster, the missing scholars should have known perfectly well that such a debate was not going to occur. And so I am at a loss as to how they justify their absence. They would also do well to explain their silence while their colleague, Ron Suny, was being savaged in the press for engaging in scholarship. FUTURE DIRECTIONS The next steps need to be focused around specific questions. The most important theme that arose was that of history and memory. I would like to see textbook analysis (which some people, including at least one of the participants in the Chicago round, have worked on); more on popular culture (Professor Berktay's work on Turkish literature was mentioned above; Professor Gocek dealt with contemporary Turkish-Armenian literature; I would like to see a more representative sample of works placed carefully in the broader context of Armenian as well as Turkish literature); the matter of dubious inheritance needs further exploration - and there are scholars in Turkey engaged in such exploration. The wall of silence is far from destroyed. But the Chicago workshop made a big crack in that wall, and for that we must be grateful.","Lima, Vincent",Armenian Reporter International,2000-04-01,0
"Pope John Paul II Goes to St. James Armenian Cathedral in Jerusalem, Marking First-Ever Visit There by a Latin Pope On Sunday, March 26, 2000, following his morning visits to the Jewish Western Wall and the Muslim Haram Al Sharif, His Holiness Pope John Paul II and his motorcade made a short visit to the St. James Armenian Convent inside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. Although not previously publicized and unreported in the foreign press, the visit was pre-planned in the Vatican, through the intercession of Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, with Cardinal Sylvestri on his most recent visit to Rome, prior to the departure of the Pope for the Holy Land. The visit was a surprise to other Christian denominations who felt somewhat left out and full of envy, causing a level of grumbling and displeasure. His Beatitude Archbishop Torkom Manoogian, Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem, and the entire membership of the Saint James Brotherhood welcomed the pope at the western entrance of the Saint James Convent. The pontiff was then escorted with the solemn ceremony of Hrashapar into the Saint James Cathedral where he was seated on a special throne in front of the altar. In a short welcoming address, His Beatitude welcomed the Latin Pontiff in the presence of more than 500 invited guests from the Armenian community and other Christian churches. Archbishop Manoogian presented Pope John Paul with an Armenian khatchkar adorned in mother-of-pearl and crafted by the hands of our talented artists of Bethlehem. Then, the pope received a spiritual gift, a rendition of Ave Maria by 12-year-old Taleen Kalbian, an Armenian-American girl. Truly, this was an event of historic proportions in that, for the first time in the history of the Armenian Church, a Latin pope had formally visited one of the most sacred shrines of the Armenian Church. The Saint James Cathedral has been characterized in history by many Western visitors as The Gem of Churches in Jerusalem. It seems that the leadership in the Vatican decided to make up for the fact that Pope John Paul II was not able to visit Holy Etchmiadzin on his visit to Russia last autumn.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2000-04-01,0
"Historians from Turkey, Germany, and the U.S. Talk About the Genocide Over the weekend of March 17-19, scholars from ten universities and research centers met at the University of Chicago to present papers and discuss the controversial topic Armenians and the End of the Ottoman Empire. Organized by a committee consisting of historian/political scientist Ronald Grigor Suny of Chicago, historical sociologist Muge Gocek, literary historian Kevork Bardakjian, anthropologist/historian Stephanie Platz, and historian Kenneth Church of the University of Michigan, the gathering exceeded all expectations by its collegial and open-minded discussion, the seriousness of the papers, and the evident good will and trust demonstrated by the participants. Sponsored by the Council for Advanced Studies on Peace and International Cooperation (CASPIC) and the Center for Middle Eastern Studies of the University of Chicago and the International Institute of the University of Michigan, the workshop was conceived to be the first in a series of conferences that would advance the broader discussion of the history, literature, and politics of the Armenian Genocide. Professor Suny opened the workshop with a brief statement in which he said, This is a small, humble, and historic meeting - the first time that scholars of various nationalities, including Armenians and Turks, have gathered together to present papers and discuss in a scholarly fashion the fate of the peoples of the Ottoman Empire as that state declined and disintegrated. We will be looking at a number of different peoples - Jews, Circassians, Kurds, Arabs, Greeks - but the principal focus will be on a people and events that have been elided in much that has been written about late Ottoman history - the massacres and deportations of the Ottoman Armenians, the first genocide of the twentieth century. We do not expect full agreement, hut we do not expect serious and learned discussion. This is a first probe, an attempt to form a new scholarly community inspired by liberal Ottomanism, tolerance of difference on the basis of equality and respect, rather than exclusivist and insular nationalism. The first papers - by Marc Baer, a graduate student at the University of Chicago; Selim Deringil, a historian at Bogazici University in Istanbul; Seteney Shami, an anthropologist at the Social Science Research council in New York City; and Engin Deniz Akarli, a historian at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island - dealt with the millet system, the administration of minorities by the Ottoman state. Baer wrote about the shift in tolerance of Jews in the early Ottoman centuries, from favored subjects in the sixteenth century to greater discrimination and repression in the late seventeenth century. Deringil opened by stating that this was the most difficult paper I have written in my life; venturing into the Armenian crisis is like wandering into a mine field. He then proceeded to give vivid accounts of Armenian-Turkish relations based on close reading of documents that he had discovered in the Ottoman archives. Deringil demonstrated how documents are susceptible to multiple readings and must be carefully analyzed, placed in their historical context, and made part of a broader analysis. Shame dealt with the images and representations of Circassians, a people who in many ways acquired a new collective identify through deportation from the Russian Empire and exile in the Ottoman Empire. Akarli questioned the narrow framework of the nation-state and the ways it has limited our understanding of complex, diverse empires. He introduced examples from Islamic law to show how difference was dealt with in the Ottoman courts. In a major address to the conference, Gerard J. Libaridian, former special assistant to the President of the Armenian Republic, emphasized the intellectual and political obstacles that block the way to a fuller understanding of the Genocide. He began by reading Eghishe Charents' poem The Crossroads, and proposed that what was important was not only what happened but what we make of what happened. He questioned, Why do some people like the problem, rather than the solution? The events of 1915 and after must be re-placed into history. A common past has been hijacked by those who accept a nationalist framework. Some historians, he said, are like failed gods; they cannot make the future in their own image, so the remake the past in their own image. Papers during the second day included treatments of Turkish nationalism by Holly Shissler, historian at the University of Chicago; Caglar Keyder, sociologist at Bogazici University; and Halil Berktay, historian at Sabanci University in Istanbul. Shissler interrogated the distinctions between Pan-Turkism, Turkism, and Turanism. Professor Keyder reiterated that nationalist narratives suppressed the actual multinational character of the Ottoman Empire and called for active remembering. Professor Berktay, who is currently studying Turkish nationalism in the vital period 1908-1918, looked at popular literature, which he argued was far more influential in creating new attitudes than the remote theorists of nationalism were. The popular writer Omer Seyfeddin, the subject of his paper, developed Turkist ideas, rejecting the diversity of the empire and looking on the West as a brazen harlot, a weak, feminine, decaying civilization. The Genocide was the focus of a four-hour discussion, with papers by historian Aram Arkun of the Zohrab Center in New York City; historian Taner Akcam of the Foundation for the Development of Knowledge and Culture in Hamburg, Germany; Suny; and Bardakjian. Closely examining the trials of the Young Turk leaders after World War I, Bardakjian revealed damning material about the planning and execution of the deportations and massacres. Arkun discussed the aftermath of the Genocide in northern Cilicia. Using documents from the Ottoman archives, he showed how the failures of the occupying Allied powers prevented Armenians from receiving justice in the post-war period. Suny presented an analysis of the Genocide from the point of view of a failed imperial strategy that attempted to reshape the empire along more pan-Turkist and nationalist lines. Taner Akcam, the first Turkish historian to write about the Genocide, recreated in detail the timing of the decision for the deportations, locating it at the beginning of March 1915. Earlier, Enver Pasha, one of the top Young Turk leaders, called other party members to Istanbul to make plans for eliminating non-Muslim elements from Anatolia. In May-June 1914 the government moved Greeks from the west Anatolian coast. On August 2, 1914, the Young Turk central committee re-established the Teshkilat-I-Mahsusa, the special organization that would later carry out many of the deportations and massacres of the Armenians. At this point its task was to work in the Caucasus to provoke Russia into a war with Turkey. After the defeat of the Ottoman army at Sarikamish at the beginning of 1915, the central committee took the fateful decisions to deport Armenians. A dual mechanism operated: an official one from the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the local gendarmeries; the other, an unofficial mechanism made up of party officials and agents sent with secret orders to provincial governors. The last morning of the conference was spent on the post-Genocide period. A paper by Hakan Ozoglu, a historian at the University of Chicago, dealt with Kurdish rebellions and incipient nationalism and argued that the history of the transition from empire to nation-state cannot be written without including the Kurds. Muge Gocek explored memoirs by Armenian writers that have recently been published in Turkish. She pointed out that the end of the Cold War, the liberalization of the Turkish media, and the 75th-anniversary celebration of the Turkish Republic had all contributed to a greater sense of security among Turkish intellectuals and thus created the possibility for new histories of the silenced past. Geoff Eley, a historian from Michigan, began his concluding commentary by relating an encounter with a lawyer in a cab. The lawyer asked where he was going, and Professor Eley answered, To a conference on the Armenian Genocide. The lawyer then asked, Is that something happening today? Clearly, Eley went on the problem is how can scholars read the public sphere and official memory. He argued that first-rate collaborative work, like that being done by the workshop, was essential before public consciousness could change. Consciousness of the Jewish Holocaust had required good scholarship first. The record had to be written. Guests came to the conference from as far away as Minnesota, California, and New Jersey. Other commentators on the papers included political scientist Robert Melson of Purdue University and historians Cornel Fleischer and Rashid Khalidi of the University of Chicago. The goal of the gathering had been to create a scholarly community based on real research, sharing of views, and trust. Evidence that this had occurred came already in the first day through the liveliness and seriousness of the discussion. On the last day the participants enthusiastically greed that another conference be held to continue the discussion. A proposed theme was: World War I and the Ottoman Empire: Imperial Dissolution in a Transnational Conjuncture. A volume of papers from the series of conferences is planned for the future.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2000-03-25,0
"Pope Hopes to Stem Exodus from the Land of Christ, Including Jerusalem's Armenian Community The Sandrouni brothers are packing their hand-crafted ceramics and moving to Toronto. They're leaving the Old City's Armenian quarter, where their father arrived as an orphan in 1920, where they were born and raised and where they became widely recognized as master ceramic craftsmen. They're joining an exodus of Christians from the Holy Land - Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - that has reduced the community's size from 13 per cent of the population 50 years ago to less than 2 per cent today. No one will stay, believe me, says Garo Sandrouni, 44, referring to the Christian families he knows in the Armenian quarter. I told our bishop once, `You will have a procession one day and there will be no one behind you', he says, standing in his well-known shop near the Old City's Jaffa gate. When Pope John Paul II fulfils a lifelong dream next week with a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he will encourage Christians to remain in the land where Jesus preached the Gospel. The Pope wants to make sure that the Holy Land doesn't become a museum of dead stones. He wants a living Christian community to remain here, says Father Michael McGarry, rector of the Jerusalem-based Tantur Ecumenical Institute for Theological Studies, set up by the Vatican in 1971. Adds Bethlehem University sociologist Bernard Sabella: He comes to say to us indigenous Christians, `Stay put.' His visit is seen as a boost for the morale of the Christian community. It will hopefully get Christians to think twice about leaving. There are about 180,000 Christians left in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza strip, most of them of Arab origin. An estimated 35,000 are Catholic and the rest belong mainly to the Greek and Eastern Orthodox faiths. If the migration had not occurred, the natural growth rate of the Christian population since 1948 would have put their numbers today at 400,000, says Sabella, who has written extensively about the subject. During the 1948 Jewish-Arab war that led to the birth of Israel, almost 60,000 Palestinian Christians were displaced and became refugees. Since then, there's been a steady flow of Christians from the Holy Land to Latin America, the United States and Canada. Bethlehem and Nazareth may be forever linked to Christian history, but their Christian communities have long since become small minorities. They live peacefully with their Arab and Jewish neighbors - Christian-Muslim tension over the building of a mosque in Nazareth is an exception - and pack their bags largely for economic and political reasons, Sabella says. Grounded in a Western-style education by Christian schools, they look abroad to escape a stagnant economy and the century-old Arab-Jewish conflict. That's partly the case with the Sandrouni brothers. Garo, George and Harout are closing the doors to their shop in June after 13 years. Garo, George and their sister, Maro, are taking their families to Toronto, where they plan to reopen their ceramic shop downtown. Harout is moving his family to Washington. It's the end of what has become an institution in the Old City. It's so sad, says Mindy Weisel, a Washington-based art teacher who visits Israel - and Sandrouni's - every year. Handicrafts of this quality are so rare...I'm tracking you down in Toronto, she tells Garo. The brothers decided to pack their bags after George visited Toronto last year and fell in love with the city. It's so clean and quiet. You don't have to push your way through everything, says George, 37, comparing Toronto to the crowded, winding alleys of the Old City. People keep to themselves; they don't want to be disturbed and they don't disturb. But when they (people in Toronto) saw me looking around with a map, someone always asked if I needed help. Toronto's cost of living - moderate compared with Jerusalem's - and the big backyards of Markham, where George stayed with a relative, were added incentives for him to leave Israel. One of the biggest draws is the size of Toronto's Armenian community - some 25,000, according to George - and its highly developed network of community centers, clubs, schools, social organizations and church life. That's how it used to be in Jerusalem 20 years ago. Now, there's no Armenian community life any more. It's almost impossible to be Armenian in the Armenian quarter, George says. With only 1,000 Armenians left in the Holy Land, the community seems to have lost the critical mass it needs to stay alive. Sabella believes it may just be a matter of time before only priests remain, caring for the church's property holdings, which cover much of the Armenian quarter. George says his 5-year-old daughter attends a Catholic kindergarten because the Armenian school has so few students. Raising their children in Jerusalem almost assures they would lose their language and culture, the brother say. Whatever pleas the Pope may have to keep Christians in the Holy Land have come too late for the Sandrounis. But as the New World beckons, nostalgia already tugs at the heart. Every time I go to the Arab market, with all those smells and people, I say, `This might be the last time.' I already miss it, George says.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2000-03-18,0
"How the Kurds and Chechens Are Being Used and Dumped by Their Sponsors Back in 1996, Robert Olson wrote a interesting essay in Middle East Policy (Vol. 4, March 1, 1966 edition), titled The Kurdish Question and Chechnya: Turkish and Russian Foreign Policies since the Gulf War. In his analytical presentation, he compared this two perennial conflicts and makes a convincing argument about how the Kurdish problem in Turkey and Russia's war against Chechnya are linked to oil politics, and how third parties are using and utilizing these two regional disputes for their geopolitical interests. He characterizes past and current Turkish-Russian relations as complex and tries to investigate to what extent their relations are influenced by the Kurdish nationalist movement in Turkey and Chechen separatist movement in Russian Federation. It is a fact that these two conflicts are limiting any foreign policy leverage that one may have over the other, and forcing both of them to recognize their vulnerability as well as their advantage in their interstate relations. THE TURKISH CARDS The Turks are using the Chechen, Azeri and Georgian cards, while the Russians, in turn, are using the Kurdish, Armenian, Abkhazian, and Ajariancards to force one other to cooperate in such vital issues as gaining control of proposed or planned oil pipeline route projects. They both are attempting to establish advantage over one other in the region's military, economic, and political arenas and are trying to form alliances with their client states. Both are operating under the pretext of creating regional stability, economic cooperation and development; each is offering its version of the pact, which, in fact, is designed to neutralize one other's influence and establish dominance in the region. Turkey and Russia are both armed to the teeth. The Turks may have a qualitative edge with their access to Western technology and possession of a sophisticated war machine, which originated from the US, France and Germany. The Russians, on the other hand, have weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear bombs, which are capable of pulverizing all of Turkey. According to the latest Russian doctrine, in case of battle defeats in conventional war, Moscow will not hesitate to use its nuclear arsenal. Along with this regional rivalry, the most ominous developments are the involvement of the other interested parties in a quest to control energy sources and energy transportation routes, coupled with their efforts to undermine the security and the unity of what are perceived to be adversary powers. Thus, we are witnessing the development of the second Cold War, whose theater has now shifted from Europe to the Caucasus and Central Asia. TWO RIVAL AXES Political commentators are already talking about the creation of two rival axes among the dozen odd states, with Turkey, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Israel on one side, sponsored by the US, and Russia, Armenia and Iran on the other side, backed by China and, possibly, India and Greece. The emerging Russian and Chinese strategic partnership is designed to create multi-polar world power centers in order to deny US supremacy and single-power status. After the NATO intervention in Yugoslavia, particularly in Bosnia and Kosovo, both the Russian Federation and the People's Republic of China, which have several multiethnic regions of their own, are feeling threatened by US power, and now they both are forming a military and political alliance. The fall of the Berlin Wall, the demise of the USSR and the collapse of Communism raised hopes for a new world order, yet the world has become more fragmented and disorderly. The initial euphoria has now been replaced by more sober assessment. What is next, particularly in the Caucasus, Central Asia and the near East? Introduction of nuclear weapons in the Indian subcontinent, and confrontation between Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India are threatening regional peace. The export of Islamic fundamentalism from Afghanistan to the newly independent former Soviet Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, coupled with the turmoil in Caucasus and Kurdish region of the Turkey, is making this region a tinderbox, which looks like it is ready to explode. Some of the players in this Great Game are pursuing an aggressive policy to gain advantage over others, namely Russia, the US and its proxy Turkey, pushing the region to the abyss with unpredictable consequences. The price is oil, a new geopolitical alignment, and neutralization of what is perceived to be the adversary country's influence. NEW COLD WAR BETWEEN TURKEY & RUSSIA Beside the hot proxy wars in Chechnya, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Kurdish region of Turkey, a new cold war is also being waged between NATO member Turkey and Russia. Before analyzing the factors and historical routes leading to the conflicts in the Kurdish region of Turkey and the Chechen region of the Russian Federation, it would be useful to review Turkish-Russian relations. Historically, the Russians and the Turks remained rivals and adversaries, having fought numerous times since the time of Peter the Great in 1711, and subsequently in 1768-1774, 1853-1856, 1877-1878, 1915-1916. Both sides harbored deep suspicions and distrust toward one other, based on good reasons. At every opportunity, they tried to undermine one another until the Great October Revolution in 1917 when Czarist Russia collapsed, the Bolsheviks withdrew from WWI and signed the infamous Brest-Litovsk treaty on March 3, 1918, which provided that the Russian army be evacuated from Turkish Armenia. Seven months later, at the end of October, the Ottoman Empire also collapsed. Terms of surrender were signed in Mudros on October 27 but didn't go into effect until October 31, 1918. Defeated Russia was in a civil war with Czarist loyalists and British interventionists, while the defeated Ottoman territories were occupied by British, French, Italian and Greek armed forces. Under threat, the Bolshevik Russians and Kemalist Turks forged an alliance and signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression on March 16, 1921, which was in effect until it was unilaterally abrogated by Soviet Russia on March 21, 1945. In 1946 Russia requested a revision of the Treaty of Montreux, asking for the restoration of Kars and Ardahan to the Soviet Union, and demanding military bases along the Bosporus and Dardanelles. After a thirty-four-year hiatus, Turkish-Russian relations grew considerably in the late 1980s and 1990s. Mutually beneficial cooperation in the economic and cultural spheres brought the two countries closer together. Russian-Turkish trade increased from $400 million in 1985 to $2 billion in 1988. Before the demise of the USSR, both sides were planning to increase their trade volume to $10 billion by the year 2000. The presence of Turkish construction companies grew dramatically, and economic cooperation continued through 1995. The preliminary agreement for natural gas transportation from Russia to Turkey under the Black Sea was signed. LINK BETWEEN CHECHEN & KURDISH CONFLICTS Meanwhile, Russian control over the Ukraine, Caucasus and Central Asia continued to wane. The Kurdish war started in 1984; a decade later, by early 1994, it had begun to play a major role in Turkish-Russian relations, especially after the beginning of the Chechen insurrection in the Caucasus. It was during this same time that the Russians sponsored a cease-fire agreement between the warring Armenians and Azeris. The agreement was signed in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan on May 9, 1994, since Russia didn't want to deal with many crises at once in the Caucasus. It was beyond the capacity of Russia to influence events simultaneously in separatist regions in the Georgian territory of Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Ajaria and now in the Russian Federation of Chechnya. The Chechens were actively supporting the separatist Abkhazians against the Georgians, and they were actively supporting the Azeri war effort against the Karabagh Armenians as well. The year 1994 was momentous for the many ominous developments in the region, which developed rapidly. After failing in the battlefields, the Azeris, first under Abulfez Elchibey and later under Heydar Aliyev, decided to use their oil card against the Armenians. With the encouragement of Ankara, they now started to openly court the multinational oil companies with over inflated oil reserve figures. Initially, they falsely claimed that they had $200 billion worth of barrels of oil reserves. Later, this was scaled down to more realistic $30 billion worth of barrels of reserves. (Now we know that they have more natural gas than oil). The presence of oil and natural gas in the Caucasus and Central Asia now stimulated the appetite of the oil companies and Western geopolitical strategists to undermine Russia and Iran's influence over the new emerging nations of the region. The oil routes on the north, from Baku, Azerbaijan to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossijsk is passing through the Chechnya. EXPLOITATION OF PIPELINE ROUTE CONTROVERSY The proposed Baku-Supsa oil pipeline routes in the south, near the Kurdish region in Turkey, are supposed to link up with the Turkish Mediterranean seaport of Ceyhan. Ethnic wars in Chechnya and the Kurdish region of Turkey now created opportunities for the long-feuding adversarial Turks and Russians to undermine one another. Between 1991 and 1994, former Soviet Air Force General Dzhokhar Dudayev conducted a separatist movement in Chechnya with active Turkish aid, and he rejected a draft treaty on confederation with Russia. Chechen nationalists Gantemirov, Mamadayev and Soslambekov had all joined the opposition to Dudayev but, encouraged by Turkish support, Dudayev persuaded the Chechen Congress to reject the draft treaty with Russia. Chechnya now become a de facto independent state but one that was not recognized by anyone. Moscow's fear, however, was that Chechnya's quest for independence may encourage other Turkic regions like Tataristan, Chuvashia, Bashkortostan, Bburyatia, Ingushettia and Dagestan, which lies along with Russia's soft belly, to follow suit, heralding the end of the Russian Federation. In fact, for a long time, some Western cold war-era warriors and Turks have been cherishing this kind of outcome and they were pushing for it. Tensions between Ankara and Moscow intensified after the Turks learned that Moscow would be the site of an international Kurdish conference in Moscow during fall of 1994. Obviously, the Russians were reciprocating for Turkish mischief in Chechnya. The former member of the Turkish Parliament, Kurdish nationalist Ali Yighit, and Necdat Buldan, who fled to Europe to escape imprisonment in Turkey, arrived in Moscow in January 1995 to sense Russia's view regarding the establishment of a Kurdish parliament in exile. WORSENING RELATIONS Turkish-Russian relations got worse. The Russians gave signals to the Turks that if they continued to undermine Russia's national unity and territorial integrity, the Turks might find themselves in the same predicament. Since the PKK was waging a war of independence in Turkey, like the Chechens in the Caucasus, the Turks wanted to show that the Russian option for oil pipeline transportation was unsafe. The Russians, in turn, could prove that the Turkish option was also unsafe, and they could play their cards as well; namely, fomenting separatism in Georgia, keeping the Karabagh dispute unresolved, and demonstrating the ability to encourage the Kurds to continue waging a war of independence in the Kurdish region of Turkey. Once again, realpolitik prevailed in all interested capitals. After receiving a promise from the Turks that Ankara would not allow volunteers to go and fight in Chechnya and would not sell arms to the Chechens, rather it would use its influence on Dzhokhar Dudayev and his advisers to persuade them to negotiate with Moscow, the Russians, in turn, with then Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov as their spokesman, promised the Turks that they would not allow the Kurds to use Russia or Armenia as a base and would withdraw any political support for the Kurdish independence movement. Since then, the Turkish government has been forced to declare that Chechnya is part of the Russian Federation, and also that it will not threaten Armenia over Karabagh. In turn, the Russians kept their promise. When Abdullah Ocalan fled Syria and asked for asylum in Russia, the Prime Minister and former Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov rejected this request. For the time being, Russia and Turkey, both of which are internally weak, are forced to cooperate, as they did in the period from early 1917 to 1923., for the sake of their own national interests. Dumped by the Turks, the Chechens, after their recent decisive defeat in Grozny and Shatoi, have been complaining that they sacrificed a lot recently, as well as in the previous war, to help Turkey realize the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline route. In other words, the Chechens, under Turkish influence, sabotaged the Russian pipeline route. In other words, the Chechens, under Turkish influence, sabotaged the Russian pipeline route options to benefit the Turks; in return, they were hoping that Ankara would come to their assistance. Like their Azeri counterparts, now they learned that the Turks will go only so far to challenge the Russians, especially when they realize that war may spill over into their own territory as well. Similarly, both the Russians and the Americans dumped the Kurds for their own national interests. For their national unity and national perspectives, neither Russia nor Turkey could tolerate a separatist movement, particularly since both societies, due to lack of real democracy, couldn't offer democratic solutions to end the ethnic unrest. In Russia, at least, minorities can enjoy cultural autonomy, self-rule, and constituent republic status as long as they abide by the draft treaty provisions between the center and the periphery. In Turkey, however, you are only allowed to be called a Turk, period. For Armenians, there are lessons to be learned from these political games, which remind us once more of our earlier experience between 1896 and 1918 and from 1918 to 1923. Turkish expansionist designs, the dynamics of Turkish foreign policy, and the excessive spending of the Turkish military beyond their defensive needs, logically push the Armenian side into an alliance with Russia, Iran, and China. The ARF did a superb job by bringing the Turkish intentions to the Russians' attention during their early high-level meetings. The ARF also did an excellent job educating the poorly informed Armenian public in Armenia about Turkish dangers. In this matter, the views of President Kocharian and the Dashnaks coincide. One should be happy that Etchmiadzin, Antelias, ARF and President Kocharian are all sharing common aspirations to strengthen Armenian resolve against Turkish threats.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-03-11,0
"James Russell to Lecture on The Magic Sword of King Trdat for Zohrab Center, NYC Professor James R. Russell will deliver a lecture entitled The Magic Sword of King Trdat for the Krikor and Clara Zohrab Information Center of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America here on Tuesday, February 22 at 7:30 p.m. This talk is the third in the Zohrab Center's Year 2000 Lecture Series. The Armenian tradition attributes magical properties to the sword named Havluni that was wielded by Trdat the Great, the Arsacid king of Armenia who accepted Christianity. What is less well known is the fate of this miraculous weapon in subsequent centuries. There is reason to believe that it reappeared in the national epic of Sasun under a new name, and was used together with other miraculous instruments in the defense of the Armenians' Christian faith. This lecture will explore the fate of the Havluni sword, which has wider implications for the study of the transmission of the Armenian epic and its impact on oral literatures as remote as the Arthurian legend. Dr. James Russell is the Mashtots Professor of Armenian Studies at Harvard University. He received his Ph.D. in Religious Studies from the University of London, Bachelor of Literature in Armenian Studies from the University of Oxford, and Bachelor of Arts from Columbia College. His dissertation was published in revised form as Zoroastrianism in Armenia. Amongst his forthcoming publications are The Lost Epic of Tigran: A Reconstruction Based on the Fragments (forthcoming, in the proceedings of the UCLA Tigranakert Conference, ed. Richard Hovannisian), The Credal Poem Havadov Khostovanim of St. Nerses the Graceful (forthcoming in the proceedings of the University of Groningen Conference on Christian-Muslim Interaction in the Middle Ages, ed. Murre Van Den Berg); An Armenian Epic: The Heroes of Kasht (Caravan Press, forthcoming), and A Note on Coleridge and an Armenian Demon (forthcoming in JSAS). Recent publications include The Armenian Shrines of the Black Youth (Dukh Manuk) in Le Museon, and The Armenian Counter-culture that Never Was: Eghishé Charents,' in JSAS. The Zohrab Center is a reference and research institute which contains one of the largest libraries open to all interested in Armenian topics in the United States. Its staff assists scholars and the public at large in obtaining information on Armenian history religion, culture, and genocide. Professor Russell's lecture will be held in the Guild (G) Hall of the Diocese, which is located at 630 Second Avenue and the corner of 35th Street, in midtown Manhattan. Admission is complimentary.

"Turkish Historians Are Coming to Chicago - (Part VI of VI) The Turkish Historical Society and the Turkish Foreign Service establishment circles, quoting the revisionist pro-Turkish historian Justin McCarthy, proclaim that despite the presence of Armenia on nineteenth-century maps and the assertion of European politicians, there was in fact no Armenia in the Ottoman Empire. Prof. McCarthy, however, failed to acknowledge that in the Ottoman Empire the name of Turkey was also no present, yet Turks and Armenians were subjects of the Sultan, like the rest of other ethnic groups. The Turks also proudly proclaim that there is no Armenian Question since there are no Armenians left in Anatolia. If you press and ask them: What did happen to the Armenians? Their answer would be brief: They all left their residences and settled abroad. TURKISH VIEW OF EVENTS The Turks claim that the presentation of the 1915 events by anti-Turk historians is one-sided, since the fate of Muslim and Armenian refugees was remarkably similar, therefore just speaking of Armenian suffering and not mentioning Muslim suffering won't serve justice. War, bandits, starvation and disease killed Turks and Armenians indiscriminately. Both the Ottomans and Russians cleared border areas of part of their population in preparation for the war. In areas in which Ottoman authority was weak or in war zones, Armenians suffered terribly. In areas to the south where Ottoman authority was strong, such incidents were few and refugees arrived in Syria in relative safety. The Turks never acknowledge the historical fact that the deportees were intentionally left unprotected and abandoned to the mercy of special assassination squads (teskilat-i-mahsusiye) in prearranged killing fields (katliam mintikasi.) They cannot explain why many honest Muslim governors (mutassrifs) and mayors (kaymakams), who refused to execute, deportation and massacre orders, were removed from their positions and replaced by ruthless killers in order to continue the systematic extermination of the Armenian populace. The Turks wouldn't acknowledge the indignation of devoted Muslim mullahs who complained that the Islamic population of the towns and villages were unable to sleep and were suffering pangs of conscience because of the screaming voices of slaughtered Armenian victims. (mezbaha kurbanlari gibi feryat eden magdurun cefasindan vicdan azabi duyan Musluman ahali uykusunu kacirdi.) They wouldn't acknowledge that the special inspectors (mufettis) from the Ittihad Party headquarters supervised the deportations, the destination of the deportees, the area of concentrations, and exterminations. NOT A GENOCIDE, SAYS MC CARTHY All preplanned, prearranged, supervised and directed by the Ittihadist Party functionaries under the directive of the Ottoman Government. Justin McCarthy claims that any comparison between the Ottomans and Nazis is ludicrous, as is the use of the word genocide, to describe the actions of the Turks. He shamelessly states that What passed on between the Armenians and the Turks was not genocide - it was a war! The eminent genocide scholar Professor Vahakn Dadrian ridicules the Turkish allegation of inter-communal clashes with the following judicious and credible analysis: This description denotes the idea of a kind of civil war supposedly resulting from the relative collapse of the authority of the central government. It implies that the Armenians, an impotent, defenseless minority, were able to engage in an armed conflict with the omnipotent and dominant Turks and other Muslims ruling over them. The patent fallacy of such an allegation can be recognized by considering the following facts; On August 3, 1914, three months before Turkey intervened in the war with Russia, all able-bodied Armenian men in the 20-45 age categories, and later, in sequence, those in the 18-20 and 40-60 categories, were conscripted into the Ottoman army. What was left behind in the Armenian community was a mass of a frightened, if not terrorized, old men, women and children still haunted by the memories of the cycles of the massacres that were committed in the decades preceding WWI. Prof. Dadrian's description of these facts matches the eyewitness accounts of foreign diplomats, ambassadors, deportees and survivors. SUMMARY OF TURKISH ESTABLISHMENT VIEW The Turkish Historical Society and Turkish Foreign Service establishment circles summarize the sequence of the 1915 events as follows: 1) The Ottoman Empire entered WWI on the side of the Central Powers. At this point, Imperial Russian forces began to invade Eastern Turkey. (Historical facts reveal otherwise that Pan-Turkish Ittihadists, certain of their wartime ally Imperial Germany's victory preplanned invasion of the Caucasus and Central Asia, dreamed of unifying all Turkic nations under the Ottoman flag to create a Greater Turania, made up only by Turkic stock free of foreign elements - M.A.) 2) In 1915 this invasion was spearheaded by some 150,000 Armenian volunteers from Turkey and the Caucasus who, under the false impression that Russia was going to help them create an independent Armenia, had joined the Russian forces. Since the majority of them were Ottoman citizens, this act made them deserters. At the same time some, 40,000 to 60,000 Armenians from Eastern Turkey had formed guerrilla bands, and were attacking the Turkish army from the rear, while wreaking havoc throughout the region. (Vahakn Dadrian refutes all these Turkish fabrications based on the state archives of Turkey's wartime allies, Imperial Germany and Austria-Hungary. Dadrian points to German ambassador Metternich's seventy-two-page report to Berlin that there was neither a concentrated general uprising, nor was there a fully valid proof that such a synchronized uprising was planned or organized. DADRIAN'S REFUTATIONS Dadrian quotes German Chief of Staff of the Ottoman IIIrd Army, Felix Guse, Erzurum's German Vice-Consul Max Erwin Scheubner-Richter, Vice Consul Herman Hoffman in the southern districts that there was no proof that Armenians had any plan or intention to mount a general uprising. Dadrian also quotes General Posseldt, the German Commandant of the fortress at Erzurum, who stated that Armenians were blameless, and believed that they were the recipients of harassment and provocation on the part of Turks. Dadrian points out that the German officers described the defense of the Van and Urfa as spontaneous acts of self-defense to prevent impending annihilation. As Dadrian mentions, all the able-bodies Armenian men of military age, including those in the reserve age category, were already conscripted into the Ottoman Army to serve their Sultan. Only women, children, young and the elderly were left behind, they also were deported and were left to their destiny to die, and Armenian conscripts later were converted to labor battalions (amele taburu) and were exterminated. 3) The Turkish Historical Society claims that after some hesitation, the Ottoman government decided to relocate the Armenian- communities of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Anatolia in Syria, and Iraq which, at that time, were Ottoman provinces. Then the Turks claim that the relocation of the Armenians was not to be punitive (indirectly acknowledging that these Armenians did nothing wrong against the state). MISREPRESENTATIONS REGARDING DEPORTATIONS They continue, Those moved were allowed to take everything they could carry, and rent would be paid according to stipulated procedures for any real property that was being vacated. (an obvious distortion of the realities, this is a result of guilt feeling, and they are trying to cover up and rationalize their wicked acts with fabrication and falsification. The candid testimony of the Turkish General Ali Fuad Erden's [Chief of Staffof Djemal Pasha] that there was neither preparation, nor organization to shelter the hundreds of thousands of the deportees is very revealing. One cannot document any proof that the surviving deportees were allowed to claim their property or were compensated. If few survivors placed claims of ownership, their petitions were left unanswered intentionally for years in order to declare Armenian-owned lands as abandoned properties so that the state could confiscate them, and they did, and later they either sold them or gave them away to Muslim Turks. Thus after the physical elimination of the Armenians, now the second phase of the genocide was started with the demolition of the churches, schools, and cemeteries in order to erase the memory of what was left from the once prosperous Armenian communities in Anatolia.) 4) Finally, Turkish policy makers confess that the implementation of this deportation decree turned out to be a tragedy because the relocation of a large mass of people proved beyond the logistical capabilities of the dying Ottoman Empire. They are trying to rationalize their criminal acts - since all the deportees were women, children and elderly - stating that a large number of Armenian causalities occurred during the relocation - due not only to intercommunal warfare which had now become widespread, but mainly to disease, harsh weather, exposure, and hunger. (They are quick to blame Mother Nature, disease and victims but never assume responsibility or culpability of their government for their criminality in premeditating, preplanning, organizing and executing the extermination of the entire Armenian race.) 5) In order to prove that the intent was not genocide, the Turkish Historical Society points out that if the case against a genocide of Armenians needs any proof, one would have to look to Istanbul, the capital of the Empire. Armenians there were untouched. (this is almost like claiming that the Nazis didn't commit genocide against the Jews, since significant numbers of Jews were still alive under the German-occupied territories. They forget that the Ottoman armies lost the war and nearly surrendered to the Entente Powers, and Istanbul was occupied. The Turks didn't have enough time to finish off the last remnants of the Armenian communities, since mathematically it was not feasible to exterminate such huge numbers of people in a short period of time. Even the Nazis, with their sophisticated gas chambers, had difficulty exterminating the entire European Jewish population. The Turks, in fact, used primitive tools like shovels, axes, sledge hammers, daggers, butcher knives, rocks or their bare hands of exterminate the Armenians, which required a longer period of time.) FORGED TURKISH DOCUMENTATION What proof, if any, might the Turks have to implicate the Armenians in a so-called uprising? Practically nothing, except the forged photographic documents, according to which, in the summer of 1915, officials in the Ottoman Ministry of Interior's Propaganda Department Directorate were assigned the task of collecting suitable material for a propaganda publication for future use. In order to justify Armenian deportations (tehcir and sevkiat), they had to produce materials showing that Armenians were armed and organized, threatening the security of the Ottoman State. For this, the Turkish Interior Ministry sent directives to the interior to send damaging photographs implicating Armenians in planning insurrection. For this purpose the Armenian leaders and notables were forcefully assembled in front of the Armenian institutions prior to their deportation, where they posed for pictures with government-owned weapons and ammunition. Later, the Turks claimed that these Armenians were arrested in the possession of illegal arms. These kinds of forged materials later became the basis for Turkish assertions that Armenians were armed to carry out an uprising against the Ottoman State. After reviewing the allegations, falsifications, distortions, and fabrications of the Turkish Historical Society's propagandist campaign against the Armenians, aimed at shifting the blame to the victims in order to exonerate the perpetrators, one may not have high expectations from the visiting Turkish historians that they will be more factual and forthcoming to criticize their Historical Society's position which is identical to the official Turkish views, as discussed before. To make the Turkish historians' visit a reality, the organizing committee took extra precautions to confine discussions exclusively to Turkish-Armenian relations within the Ottoman Empire, prior to the Genocide, and they tried to push the issue of the genocide to the periphery, as a disputable and marginal subject in Turkish-Armenian relations. CONFERENCE TO AVOID CONTROVERSY According to some critics, the reason for keeping the workshop within delimited parameters is not to create a confrontation so that, at the end, the organizers, being non-controversial, can claim success. This will please officials in Ankara and Washington in the sense that Turks and Armenians are discussing the historical events to narrow their differences only in the historical perspective, devoid of any political implication. The Turks, indeed, are more than happy to discuss historical issues with almost anyone as long as territorial issues, financial compensation, or reclaim of ownership of former Armenian properties remain dead issues. Since the validity of the Armenian Genocide issue was put in question in the invitation letter sent to invitees by the organizers of this conference, the most reputable and respected scholars and historians declined to participate. Yes, Turks and Armenians should sit around the table and discuss what happened between their forefathers during 1915, and try to solve outstanding issues in academic or political settings without stipulation and preconditions, with intellectual honesty and a sense of factuality. For this, one anticipates that the participants should be well qualified, reputable, nonbiased, and academically honest, having conducted serious research on the genocide issue and Ottoman history, the history of the Turkish Republic and Turkish-Armenian relations. WHO'S INVITED AND WHO'S NOT Reputable and internationally known scholars like Prof. Vahakn Dadrian, Prof. Richard Hovannisian, Director of ANI (Armenian National Institute) Dr. Rouben Adalian, Prof. Stephen H. Astourian, Prof. Levon Marashlian, and doctoral candidate Ara Sarafian are the most effective and qualified when it comes to Armenian-Turkish relations and the genocide issue, yet they may choose not to participate. Prof. Yair Auron, Prof. Robert J. Lifton, Prof. Roger W. Smith, Yves Ternon, Yehuda Bauer, Helen Fein, Israel Charny, and Hilmar Kaisar were not even invited. The participants in the Conference from Turkey include Bektay Halil, Deringil Selim, Gole Nilufer, Keyder Caglar, Oktayli Ulber, Akarli Engin, Hanioglu Sukru, Kaili Hasan, Akcam Taner, Fatma Gocek. Invited from the US are Kevork B. Bardakjian, Kenneth Church, Stephanie Platz, Ronald Grigor Suny, and Aram Arkun. Stephanie Platz, Ronald Grigor Suny, and Aram Arkun. Stephanie Platz is very new in the field of nationalism in modern Armenia between 1988 and 1994; she has limited experience in the field of the Ottoman-Turkish history and the Genocide. Kenneth Church from the University of Michigan similarly has limited and generalized familiarity with these subjects. Ronald G. Suny has limited knowledge on the issue of the Genocide and Ottoman-Turkish history; he often analyzes the nationalism issue with outdated Marxist dogma and is an ardent supporter of multiethnic, multilinguistic, multi-religious state structure, along the lines of the US State Department policy. He vehemently opposes Armenian nationalism, without criticizing virulent Turkish and Azeri nationalism, equates Armenian nationalism, without criticizing virulent Turkish and Azeri nationalism, equates Armenian patriotism with narrow-minded nationalism, and believes that the Armenian Genocide was not premeditated and preplanned ahead of time; rather, it was a wartime contingency response by the Ottoman State. Only Aram Arkun from the US side is qualified, has credentials and knowledge in the field of the Armenian Genocide and Turkish-Armenian relations. With all our expectations and reservations, we wish success to the participants of the Chicago conference, and will look forward to the press releases and publication of the contents for academic and public scrutiny, both in Turkey and the US. The unofficial workshop has the backing of Istanbul Boghazici University, the Turkish Foreign Ministry, the US State Department and the University of the Chicago. We thank them for their understanding and encouragement in order to find a common language between former Ottoman subjects. After the proposed establishment of an Armenian chair in Ankara University, the Turks will continue to engage the Armenian side in order to exchange views in Turkish-Armenian historical relations, while intentionally avoiding the genocide issue and its political implications. The Chicago meeting will not produce any documents to recognize the Armenian Genocide as a historical reality, and the presence of the few historians studying Armenian history will create a false impression that they also have reservations about the validity of the Genocide. Newtonville, NY Note. Because of the shroud of secrecy around this conference, the names of the participants, and the content of the subjects in this upcoming conference discussed in this six series may be subject to changes in the future. Next week: a new series will examine the issue of the politics of forgiveness, neo-Ottomanism, Turkish expansionism in the Caucasus and Central Asia, oil pipeline politics, wars in Chechnya and the Kurdish region of Turkey.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-02-12,0
"Turkish Historians Are Coming to Chicago - (Part V of VI) According to the Turkish Constitution, The Republic of turkey is a democratic, secular and social state, governed by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public peace, national solidarity, justice and respecting human rights. If the ruling elite remains faithful to the spirit of this synthesis, the citizens of this country should live in peace and harmony. However, the reality is that justice is often implemented depending on the ethnicity and background of the individual. In a court of law, one's racial background may play a major role in determining the outcome of the verdict. It is not uncommon for the accused, if they happen to be Turkish in origin, to charge the plaintiff, if they happen to be giaour (infidel - term used for Armenians and Greeks), or Jefets (term used for Jews), with insulting Turks or the religion of Islam. This attribution would be sufficient grounds to turn the court's opinion immediately against the plaintiff. The Muslim Kurds may also find themselves in the same predicament. If one labels a Kurd a nationalist or separatist, casting doubts about his loyalty, this may serve as a warrant for his arrest. Even the devoted Muslims who are Turkish in origin are nowadays having legal problems. If you don't like someone's philosophy, call him a fundamentalist, or reactionary, this incrimination could be sufficient reason to incarcerate the dissenter. Those, who are exposed to Western ideas and harbor tolerant views with reference to minorities, or those who may want to translate a book or write an article about them, may risk censorship, reprimand or jail sentence. A FEW COURAGEOUS TURKS For example, one Turkish publisher made a mistake by translating the Encyclopedia Britannica accurately into Turkish, where the history of Armenia and Armenians was also mentioned. Because of this, charges of separatism were brought against the printing house and its director for allowing Armenian propaganda. There are many courageous Turks, like Ragip Zarakoglu from the Belge Publishing Company who is trying to budge the bureaucratic system and is taking risks. Unfortunately, a long struggle lies ahead for this new generation of Turks. The hope is in Europe. They predict that once Turkey is accepted into the EU, the ruling military and political elite may be forced to comply with European standards. This is what the new Turkish intelligentsia is hoping for but there will be a long journey before this dream becomes a reality. The consequences of the discriminatory wealth tax, illegal confiscation of the Armenian properties, and new laws designed to prevent Armenians from returning to their ancestral lands or, if they return, not have permission to form communities of more than ten houses, have already been discussed in my previous article. Also touched upon were the intimidation tactics against Armenian institutions such as schools and churches. It is a fact that Armenian parents, prior to registering their children in Armenian schools, have the burden of proving that the children are actually Armenian. Also the State has the right to close any church on the pretext that there are not enough attendants, and declare it abandoned property. The teaching of Armenian history in schools is prohibited. The discussion of the Armenian Genocide, publication of maps bearing the name of historical Armenia, or translation of books related to Armenian issues are forbidden, unless the official government views are represented. Armenian Genocide studies by foreigners are discouraged. Only a handful of trusted Turkish historians, or pro-Turkish foreigners who holding views identical to the official Turkish views, are permitted to have access to the classified Ottoman archives. Official publishing houses print only works which reflect the official line. SOME CRACKS IN THE BUREAUCRATIC WALL Fairly recently, however, some cracks appeared in this huge bureaucratic wall, thanks to the brave Turk, Ragip Zarakoglu's efforts. Because of him, the publication of Prof. Levon Marashlian's paper delivered at the Turkish Historical Society's XI Congress in 1990, and the translation and publication of the eminent genocide scholar Prof. Vahakn Dadrian's book, Ulusal Ve Uluslararasi Hukuk Sorunu Olarak Jenosid, in 1995 became a reality. All these facts and realities have to be presented to the public's attention, to familiarize readers interested in Turkish and Ottoman history with the complexity of the situation. Only those who have actually lived through the ordeal can have a keen understanding of the situation. The others, who have studied Turkey and Turkish history exclusively through books, articles, audiovisuals, lecture series or brief visits, will have an incomplete picture of that country, which still has an identity problem and is in a transition period. One of the ordeals, which Armenians, Greeks, and Jews lived through and which has left a lasting imprint on their memory, is the agonizing episode of the September 6-7, 1955 anti-minority riots in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir, which was again premeditated, organized and executed by the State. During these fateful 48 hours, the destruction of minority properties, workplaces and sanctuaries, including churches and cemeteries, was beyond description. The frightening part was the government, which was supposed to guarantee its citizens' safety, security and property as stated in the constitution, was the organizer and planner of these horrifying rampages, reminiscent of the state terrorism of the Ittihadist Young Turks. These events once again confirmed the only with government instigation and encouragement can crimes of this nature occur in Turkey. Ordinary people in turn, are only enthusiastic participants when their leaders foment hatred against minorities and incite their destruction. Otherwise, Muslim Turks are a law-abiding people, who truly believe in their leaders and that they know the best. During the riots, after the destruction of properties, the Turkish mobs, which had been brought in form the interior by the organizers, went wild and started to attack the residential sections inhabited by the minorities, and commit rapes and killings the whole night through. NO LONGER ANY SKEPTICISM Even the most skeptical person who once had a hard time believing that the Turks could kill 1.5 million human beings in 1915, were now convinced that once the government sponsors this kind of vandalism, anything is possible. When our parents were giving their accounts of the deportations, rapes, fires, kidnappings and killings, we were saddened but as soon as we left the house, after breathing fresh air and resuming our routines, shook our heads and tried to forget what we had heard. After the September 6-7, 1955 events, our views changed. It was very hard for us to understand that, after singing the Turkish National Anthem every weekend and reciting the allegiance to the Turkish State every morning in our classrooms, we were told that we were aliens in our own country and mistreated. Our parents worked very hard; they paid their taxes to the state; the male population did their duty in the Turkish Armed Forces; many served in Korea in the Turkish brigade. What did we do wrong that our very existence now was put in jeopardy? After these horrible events, most minorities left Turkey for good, settling in Greece, Israel, Armenia, Europe, Americas, and Australia. Those who stayed behind tried to lick their wounds. Five years later, after the coup d'etat on May 27, 1960, the National Unity Committee was formed, and power was transferred to the military junta under the leadership of General Djemal (Cemal) Gursel. All former government leaders and members of the parliament were arrested and members of the parliament were arrested and sent to remote Yassiada, a small island located in the Sea of Marmara, for trial. One of the serious charges brought against deposed Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Interior Minister Adnan Menderes, Interior Minister Namik Gedik, Foreign Minister Fatin Rustu Zorlu, and President Celal Bayar was related to the September 6-7, 1955 anti-minority riots, reminiscent of the Court Martial hearings against Iddihadists in 1918-1919. The prosecutor and judge accused the defendants of premeditating and organizing the riots, which caused billions of dollars of property damage and loss of lives, while humiliating the nation in the eyes of the world. All the defendants, except the deposed president, were sent to the gallows on other charges, including violation of the constitution. The details of the proceedings quite adequately documented that the deposed government leadership sent its agents from the interior ministry to Selanik (Salonica), Greece, and planted an explosive device in Ataturk's birthplace in order to incite anti-Greek riots in major Turkish cities where most minorities are concentrated. This was done intentionally in order to force minorities to abandon their properties and leave the country, and also to intimidate the Greek government to force them to be more forthcoming in the Cyprus negotiations. This incident also proved beyond any reasonable doubt that, in Turkey, only the government can premeditate, organize and execute crimes of this dimension, and can incite the masses against unwanted elements. SAME TACTICS, DIFFERENT GROUP Thirty years these deplorable events, more aggressive and brutal terror was now directed against another ethnic group, the Kurds. From 1988 until the present, 30,000 Kurds have been killed; 3 million of them have been deported and relocated; 3,000 Kurdish villages have been torched. Naturally the Turks are again blaming the terrorists and separatists, but nothing has been said about the organizers and perpetrators of the Kurdish atrocities, and yet the constitution still claims that every citizen of this country is equal and protected. The Turks are also successfully utilizing the ASALA's (so-called Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia) anti-Turkish and terrorist activities from 1973 to 1994, to oppose recognition of the Armenian Genocide. During these years, from Santa Barbara, California to Sydney, Australia, from Paris, France to Burgaz, Bulgaria, from Vienna, Austria to Ottawa, Canada, 34 Turkish foreign service employees, ambassadors, and consul general fell victim to ASALA revolutionaries. The Turks are pointing to these isolated incidents of the past 21 years trying to convince the world that the Armenians committed similar terrorist activities in the past and incited troubles throughout the Ottoman Empire, forcing the Turkish government to take preventive and defensive measures. Speaking about terrorism, the Turks until recently never admitted that the Turkish gangsters and village vigilantes on the government payroll, assigned by the Turkish Intelligence Services, conducted anti-Kurdish campaigns in the Kurdish region of Turkey since 1988, causing countless deaths among Kurdish intellectuals, writers, human-rights activists, and political leaders. This became public knowledge after the car accident in Susurluk, which exposed the cooperation between the government and gangsters. The Turkish public was shocked after learning that the body of one of the most wanted Turkish international terrorists was found alongside those of the governor and high-ranking Turkish intelligence officer; apparently all were returning from a party. ARMENIANS DEPICTED AS AGGRESSORS Since the eruption of the Karabagh conflict in 1988, Turkish propagandists have again pictured the Armenians as aggressors, committing genocide against the defenseless Azeri Turks with Russian help, and burning down Azeri towns and villages with barbarity. The Turkish Historical Society, drawing parallels between the Ottoman-Armenian conflict in 1876-1918 and Armenian-Azeri conflict in 1988-1994, is trying to convince the world that what the Armenians are doing in Azerbaijan today is similar to what they did against the Ottomans. The Turks prefer not to mention the atrocities committed by the Azeris against the peaceful Armenians in Sumgait, Baku, Kirovabad (Ganja), Shahumyan and Martakert, or the forced expulsion of the 350,000 Armenians with the help of Soviet interior ministry forces, or the burning of the Armenian settlements, or the day-and-night bombardment of residential areas in Stepanakert. They always present Armenians as villains and aggressors, and Turks as peaceful victims of the Armenian atrocities. The Turkish ruling circles certainly have a biased perception of the Armenians, or they believe that dehumanizing the Armenians serves their national objectives and interests well. After all, as they say, the best defense is a powerful offense. Thus, before the Armenians accuse the Turks of wrongdoing, it would be better to charge the Armenians with committing genocide against the Azeris in the Caucasus today and against the Ottomans in the past. This is the way they think. Hopefully, the visiting new generation of Turkish historians will make an effort to learn the realities during the time when their government tried to hide the facts from their own people. We all know what they said until now was sheer fabrications and distortions. They not only rejected any reprehensibility but, on the contrary, they justified the Armenian deportations and massacres without remorse. To make matters worse, they blamed the victims for their own demise. Our anticipation is that they will come up with fresh new ideas that will be closer to the truth.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-02-05,0
"Turkish Historians Are Coming to Chicago - (Part IV of VI) The Turks are a very intelligent, calculating, and nationalistic people. They understand international politics well and closely study the strengths and weaknesses of their adversaries and friends alike. They don't blab, they are reserved and patient. When their country was under foreign occupation, the Turks waited patiently; they took every abuse without creating a commotion, but when the right moment came, they asserted their power and will, and they defeated the enemy. Today, the Turks are fighting against Armenian charges with the same prudence, resolve, and consistency. We al know that they are trying to conceal, to deceive and mislead public opinion, and some historians are falling into a trap. In fact, some reputable analyses and experts are buying the argument that the Armenian Genocide was not premeditated, preplanned and executed by the Ottoman government; rather, it was a wartime response or a series of contingent responses to the desperate situation in which the Ottoman state found itself. The supporters of this theory include Ronald Grigor Suny from the University of Chicago, his Turkish colleagues Fatma Muge Gocek from Brown University, Engin Akarli, Selim Deringil from Bogazici University, and Turkish apologists William L. Langer, Justin McCarthy, Stanford J. Shaw, Steven T. Katz, Heath Lowry, Bernard Lewis and Thomas Goltz. NAIM BEY PAPERS A FORGERY The Turkish Historical Society always questions the validity of the Naim Bey papers, labeling them a forgery. They assert, Armenian propagandists are claiming that the massacres were an Ottoman government policy, looking for proof that such a decision was in fact made; for this purpose the Armenians produced a number of telegrams attributed to Talat Pasha, supposedly found by British forces commanded by General Allenby when they captured Aleppo in 1918. It was claimed that they were found in the office of an Ottoman official named Naim Bey, and they were not destroyed only because the British occupation came with unexpected speed. The Turks insist that these telegrams were not authentic; rather, they were fabricated and forgeries. They postulate further that following the Entente occupation of Istanbul, the British and French arrested a number of Ottoman political and military figures on charges of war crimes. In this, they were given substantial assistance by the Ottoman liberal Union Party, which had been installed by the Sultan after the war, and which was anxious to do anything to destroy the Union and Progress party (Ittihadist) and its leaders, who had long been political enemies. The Turkish Historical Society claims further that the British looked everywhere to find evidence against those who been sent to Malta, nothing incriminating could be found among the Ottoman government documents. The Turks also claim that `the Ottoman archives contain a number of orders, whose authenticity can definitely be substantiated, issued on the same dates, in which Talat Pasha ordered investigations to be made to find and punish those responsible for the attacks which were being made on the deportation caravans. Turkish officials now at least are forced to recognize that the deportee caravans were unprotected; indeed, contrary to their original allegations, those caravans were attacked and massacred, but these officials claim that this was not ordered by the government. WHO DID THE SLAUGHTER? If one believes these allegations, the next question would be: who were the criminals who attacked the deportee caravans and mercilessly slaughtered 1.5 million innocent women, children, young and elderly, all over Eastern Anatolia, day and night? Mathematically, it is hard to calculate how many criminals would be required to complete the eradication of one million people. Now, if the Ottoman government was not the organizer of these massacres, then the blame for the mass murder would have to be placed on the entire Turkish civilian population for its voluntary participation in the atrocities. For a while, the Turks were floating the alleged civil war theory to explain the number of deaths, including their own wartime causalities in the war zones. This conjecture has already been debunked by credible genocide scholars. Wouldn't it be less damaging for the Turks' image if a handful of government officials were to blame rather than the entire Turkish nation? Only the naive and gullible would believe that the perpetrators of the mass crimes ever would issue official orders in writing; they usually issue secret decrees and oral orders, while shredding any existing documents. Or they would classify and hide them in the archives, only show non-damaging materials, as the Turks are doing today. Everyone knows from the outcomes that the Nazi atrocities against Jews, Gypsies, Eastern European nations, Ukrainians, and Russians occurred. The same is true in the case of Stalin's atrocities against his own people and massacres in Uganda, Burundi, Cambodia, Bosnia, Kosovo or elsewhere. In none of these cases would one be able to document any written and signed order from the government, president or dictator, but all these happened in our century. END RESULT INDISPUTABLE It is also true in the case of the Armenian Genocide; the end result of this colossal crime is indisputable. The destruction inflicted on the Armenian cities, towns, villages, churches, schools, houses and cemeteries are all well documented. The premeditated arrest and murder of thousands of peaceful Armenian intelligentsia, clergy, and leadership, as a prelude to the general deportation orders, proves behind a reasonable doubt that the destruction of the detested race (Armenians) was well planned ahead of time. The eradication of the Armenian population in eastern Anatolia and the reduction of the Armenian presence in Turkey from 2.56 million (which, with natural growth, would have been 15 million now) down to 45,000, is more than enough evidence anyone would need to prove that the Armenian presence in Anatolia was systematically eliminated. 7) In order to refute Armenian figures of 1.5 million deaths, the Turks are trying to play with the numbers. The question they pose is, Did 1.5 million Armenians die during WWI? They continue, Like the rest of their claims, this also is highly exaggerated, with the number claimed being increased over time. The Turks agree about the bulwark figure of 600,000 deaths, as if this is a small number. Immediately, however, in order to reduce the impact, they claim that 1.5 million Muslims died as well. They fail to mention that most of the Muslim (Turks, Kurds, Arabs) casualties were in the six war fronts, including the Armenian-inhabited Eastern Front (Russian or Caucasian Front,), but there was no Armenian front per se, since there was no state called Armenia in 1915. They agree that over 1,559.000 Ottoman Armenians were living in small town and villages scattered all over Anatolia, but they minimize the number of deaths. How many Armenians died? they ask, and their answer is, It impossible to determine the numbers exactly, since no complete death records or statistics were kept during those days. CONTRADICTING THEMSELVES AGAIN Again the Turks are directly contradicting themselves for, if there were no statistics, how were they able to calculate that 1.5 million Muslims died? If one looks at the population figures for the Armenian-inhabited provinces prior to and after 1915, as contained in old Turkish publications, it becomes very obvious that a large number of those Armenians just disappeared off the face of earth. Based on official Ottoman statistics, the Turks claim that there were 1,550,000 Armenians living in the Ottoman territory in 1914. The Patriarchate of Istanbul gives the figure of 2,560,000. Aside from these figures, the Turks confess that at least 600,000 Armenians died. Their explanation, according to a Turkish Foreign Service publication: The implementation of this deportation decree turned out to be tragic because he relocation of a large mass of people proved beyond the logistic capabilities of the dying Ottoman Empire. Up to now, they cannot explain why women, children, elderly, disabled, even young pregnant mothers had to be deported under the most dismal circumstances, if the intent was not extermination of the Armenian race. 8) the political question that the Turks scorn the most: Is the Treaty of Sevres still in force? This is one of the reasons that they don't want any responsibility or accountability for the Armenian Genocide. They reemphasize over and over again that the Treaty of Sevres was buried after the signing of the Treaty of Gumri, Moscow and Kars. The reason for their refusal is to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia. They fear that this issue may be resurrected again, since the signatory countries - USSR, Soviet Russia, Soviet Armenia, Soviet Georgia, Soviet Azerbaijan and Soviet Ukraine - are nonexistent, and now there are New Independent States, which may require renegotiation of the some of the provisions of this treaty. MINORITY TREATMENT TODAY 9) The most troubling question is: Are the Armenians of Turkey being persecuted today? In this regard, the Turks' favorite lines are: The Turks and Armenians lived side by side in peace for six centuries, and the Turks suffered as much as the Armenians at the time of deportations. This is another false allegation. If anything, the Turks benefited the most by confiscating and assuming the ownership of the lands and properties of the Armenians without having to pay any compensation; they also assumed the life insurance and investment accounts of the dead Armenians. As far as the situation in recent history is concerned, it is not any better. The Turks claim that the 45,000 Armenians living in Turkey today are in no way separated from the remainder of the population. They are full citizens, with the same rights and privileges as other Turkish citizens, with their lives, liberties and happiness guaranteed by law. If one reads the informative book written by the Turkish human-rights activist Yelda Ozcan, needless to say, one can see that the minorities are held hostage for foreign policy considerations. For example, in the case of Jews; numerous threats were made to them over the Israeli invitation of Armenian Genocide scholars to a genocide conference in Jerusalem. The Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Elie Wiesel, founding chairman of the US Holocaust Council, in his recent book, reveals how Turks threatened the well-being of Jews in Turkey if the Armenian Genocide was included in the Holocaust Museum, or if Armenians were invited to the Genocide Conference in Tel-Aviv. Those belonging to the Greek minority were placed under expulsion, with the threat of their property being confiscated, if Greece continued making trouble in Cyprus. Likewise, the Patriarch of Istanbul, Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan, was forced to come out against the French House Resolution in reference to the Armenian Genocide. Another revealing book, Salkim Hanimin Taneleri (Salkim Hanim's Necklace), by Yilmaz Karakoyunlu reveals many historical in Turkey to the Turkish public. In this book the author focuses on the racist and discriminatory aspects of Turkish government policies and how minorities were treated in the past. The author exposes the known facts for the first time to the Turkish public; i.e., how the Turks viewed Germany during the WWII years, believing in that country's invincibility and readiness to conquer the world. The author reveals how the Turkish government established the village institutes (Halk Evleri), and the youth organization, Grey Wolves (Bozkurts) equal to the Nazi fascist youth organization. Under the late President Ismet Inonu, most former Ittihadists, who were actively involved in the Armenian Genocide were assigned to important positions, like Sukru Saracoglu who became Foreign Minister and later Prime Minister The author, who is a deputy from the Motherland Party (ANAP), reveals how the Turkish government denied the docking of a ship in Istanbul carrying hundreds of Jewish refugees. The Turkish Daily News reminds its readers that even though the Ottomans once bragged - and the Turkish state has not yet tired of boasting - of its past tolerance of the Jews who fled from Spain in the 16th century, this incident did not happen very long ago. The book also sheds light on how Prime Minister Sukru Saracoglu, desperate for cash to maintain a 1.5 million-strong wartime army, classified its citizens into three different categories: Muslims, Christians, and Donmes - converts (mostly Jews who adopted Turkish names and Muslim faith), and imposed astronomical taxes on minorities only. The reason was obvious, to bankrupt these minorities and hand business to Muslim Turks. The author is referring to the so-called Wealth-Tax (Varlik Vergisi) adopted on November 12, 1942, when most minorities, including the Armenians, Greeks, and Jews, lost all their savings and properties and were forced to go into exile in Ashkale to serve in labor battalions for the building of roads, and many died. According to exiles, they would have been executed if Nazi Germany had won the Battle of Stalingrad during WWII. The book also shed light on how the legal code was amended to claim that Armenian foundations, although considered to be legal Turkish institutions, are foreign to prevent Armenians from acquiring foundations or property in Turkey. There are other sinister laws that were introduced prior to 1936, prohibiting Armenians from buying lands in the former eastern provinces that had sizable Armenian populations prior to 1915. Many other laws prevented the Armenian remnants in the Turkish interior from forming communities larger than 10 houses, in order to prevent any significant Armenian presence from developing there. The last Armenian inhabitants of Diarbekir and Sivas also left for the reasons described above.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-01-29,0
"Turkish Historians Are Coming to Chicago (Part II of VI) In order to analyze the Turkish mentality, thinking process and attitude toward Armenian assertions and criticism of the Turks, who were accused of committing a great injustice to the Armenian nation ever since their arrival from the Central Asia, let us get familiar with the Turkish versions of history: 1) The Turkish Historical Society and foreign policy establishment circles argue against the validity of the Armenian assertion that Eastern Anatolia is the original homeland of the Armenians. They categorize the theory that the Armenians descended from Hayk, great-great-grandson of the Biblical patriarch Noah, as an unscientific claim, devoid of any evidence. They reject the idea that there is a link between Urartians and Armenians, despite the abundant evidence that during the historical process Armenians, people of Hayasa, and Uratu merged and forged a union in a country called Armenia, as attested to by ancient historians. Invoking other Armenian historians' account that the Armenians descended from the Thracian-Physician group, the Turks refute the Urartu-Armenia link, which could be traced back to the 3rd millennium BCE. The Turks claim the Armenian presence was recorded for the first time in the Behistun inscription of the Persian Emperor Darius the Great in 521 BC, but they add that these people were not related to the present-day Armenians. The Turks allege that the people named in that inscription were those who were coming from the geographical region, which used to be called Armenia at the time. It is the official Turkish Historical Society's position that Armenia is not the name of a country populated by the Armenians; rather, it is merely the name of a geographical region, which was one of the satrapies of the Persian Empire. ARMENIANS ARE NOT INDIGENOUS TO ARMENIA The Society tries hard to convince its readers that Armenians call themselves Hay; since their migration to the geographical region called Armenia, they adopted the name and called themselves Armenian. The Society conveniently ignores the historical accounts of the ancient historians like Herodotus, Tacitus, Strabo, Plutarch, Dino, etc. The Turks are even trying to ignore Muslim Arab historians' accounts, according to which, when Arabs invaded Armenia, they still called the Armenian lands Ermeniye under the Arab governors, and later they recognized the sovereignty of the Armenian kings and called them King of Ermeniye. The Turkish Encyclopedia (Vol. XV, Ankara, 1968) (former Inonu Encyclopedia) even mentions Ermensahlar Devleti (Kingdom of the Armenian State). Depending on the era, the Turkish government sometimes, accidentally or intentionally, tolerates translation of foreign sources like Ana Britanika 1988 (Encyclopedia Britannica), in which the accurate versions of Armenian history are translated. However, the publisher was later incarcerated for spreading separatist propaganda. Unfortunately, Armenian history still remains a taboo for the Turkish public. 2) The Turkish Historical Society and Turkish foreign policy establishment's next question is, did the Turks take the lands (eastern Anatolia) from the Armenians by force? The Turks proclaim that Armenians never exercised sovereignty and independence in the territories where they once lived. The point of this proclamation is to substantiate their argument that the Armenians cannot claim ownership over the geographical region once called Armenia. Ahmet Esat Uras, an Ittihadist and revisionist historian, as well as participant and one of the organizers of the Armenian Genocide, claims: ARMENIAN SOVEREIGNTY NEVER EXISTED The Armenians remained under the rule of various empires - Roman, Persian, Byzantine and Arab - and couldn't continuously maintain any sort of independent and unified Armenian state; therefore, they cannot claim any legal ownership to the eastern Anatolian territory. In order to underestimate Armenian statehood and the Armenians' legal claim to the territory where they once lived as a people, the Turks argue that if they (Armenians) had a feudal state or principalities between historical intervals, they were always subject to the emperors or caliphs that once ruled over them. Furthermore, the Turks claim they didn't wrestle the region from the Armenians when they arrived there; rather, they gained it by defeating the Byzantine Empire. Again the Turks conveniently forget that there was a well-established Armenian state under the Bagratids, and Armenians were able to defend the capital Ani from invading Seljuk Turk hordes. They also forget that the second Armenian state established in Cilicia used to be a neighbor of the Seljuk Sultanate of Iconium; that the Seljuk Turk leaders were actively seeking Armenian friendship when the Mongols, traditional enemy of the Turks, were attacking Turkish settlements in every direction. The Turks also prefer not to remember that there was a sizable Armenian presence - `Milleti Ermeniyan' (Armenian Nation) - in Anatolia, which was maintained there until 1915. The Turks fail to realize that Armenians had an established state, when the Turks were living a nomadic life, and most of the European states were nonexistent, consisting merely of principalities and feudal entities. The Turks claim further that, throughout history, most of the Armenians migrated from Anatolia to Ukraine, Poland, India, and Caucasus, centuries before they were deported by the Ottomans in 1915. The Turks thus cleverly minimize the total Armenian population numbers which lived in the Ottoman Empire prior to 1915. As a consequence, they try to minimize the number of Armenians who died during the Armenian Genocide. TURKISH RULE A BLESSING 3) Have the Turks always attacked and misruled Armenians throughout history? This is their most favorite argument. Turks seriously believe that, following their conquest of Anatolia, Balkans, the lands north to Crimea, and Arabia, the Turkish sword brought peace, justice and prosperity to the occupied lands (Turk kilidji feth olan topraklara sulh, sukunet, kanun, refah ve saadet getirdi). Therefore they believe that any complaints from subjects are not justified. It is true that when the Ottoman State was at the zenith of its power, the rulers were happy to maintain the multicultural, multiethnic diversity of the empire. With this policy the subjects felt that they were part of the mighty empire, where they found relative security, prosperity, and religious tolerance. In turn, these subjects contributed immensely to the state's cultural life, commerce, economy, architecture, art, music and literature. In fact, the natives of Anatolia, like the Armenians, always considered the land their own homeland, since they had lived there for more than 3000 years. The Turks love to publicize that the `Milleti Sadika' (team used for loyal Armenians) lived side by side with the Turks in peace for some 600 years and they held high offices, particularly in the 19th century. Twenty-nine Armenians achieved the highest governmental rank of Pasha. Twenty-two Armenians became ministers, including Ministers of Foreign Affairs. Thirty-three Armenians were elected to the Parliament (Ottoman Medjlis). Seven Armenians were appointed as Ambassadors, 11 as Consul Generals. Eleven Armenians served in universities as professors. While citing these numbers as proof that the Ottoman State was tolerant toward the subject nations, contemporary Turkish historians are indirectly confessing that the acceptance of the subject ethnic populace was not a natural phenomenon, but rather it was considered to be a privileged status. The Turks claim that the Armenians were allowed to establish religious foundations (vakif) to provide financial support for their religious, cultural, educational and charity activities. TOTALITARIANISM REVEALED Here again they reveal their totalitarianism, forgetting that those rights are not privileges granted by the state; rather, they are the basic human rights that the state is supposed to provide to its citizens. Turkish historians forget that the reason for the Young Turk Revolution itself was a need to eliminate arbitrary rule, to bring constitutional changes, to provide freedom of speech, press, and assembly, and to relieve the toiling populace of the burden of heavy taxes. When the Turkish-Muslim Ottoman intellectuals realized the need for changes to reform the ailing Ottoman State their best allies were Armenian intellectuals, including lawmakers, politicians, writers, and poets working shoulder to shoulder with the Ittihadists to bring the Red Sultan Abdulhamid II's despotic regime to an end. The Armenians requested that the heavy and discriminatory tax system be reformed, since they were paying more than double the amount of their Muslim compatriots. They asked for protection from the state against the abusive and oppressive rule of local Kurdish chieftains, who mushroomed during the rule of the Red Sultan, and the abusive oppression of the Hamidiye Cavalry, again created by the Red Sultan to oppress and intimidate peaceful Ottoman citizens of the Armenian extraction. The Ottoman Armenians were not asking for an independent state or cultural autonomy, but merely reforms, not exclusively for themselves, but for all Ottoman nationals. Denying these historical realities, contemporary Turkish historians claim that the Armenian propagandists suddenly claimed that the Turks mistreated non-Muslims, and in particular Armenians throughout history, in order to provide support for their claims of `genocide' against the Ottoman Empire. They continue since otherwise it would be difficult for them to explain how the Turks, who lived side by side with the Armenians in peace for some 600 years, suddenly rose up to massacre them all. They conveniently forget that the Ittihadists used Armenians for their aims, to get rid for the Red Sultan, and then turned against the Armenians, accusing them of being disloyal, as a prelude to the implementation of their own policy of purifying the Ottoman Empire of its foreign elements (Armenians.) They never acknowledge the heroic fighting of the 200,000 Armenian Ottoman conscripts against the Czarist Russian Army on the Caucasian front, in the Balkan wars, in the Arabian wars. They are completely mum about the fate of the Armenian Ottoman soldiers. We all know what happened to them: The Ittihadists took their weapons, subsequently converted them to amele taburu (labor battalions), and massacred them without mercy. The Turkish historians are misrepresenting the legitimate Armenian grievances as a subordination to, and insurrection against, the state. If the Turks and the Armenians were so happy living side by side for 600 years, what kind of terrible acts could the Armenians have done that triggered the Turks' wrath leading to the wholesale massacre of the Armenian populace in the eastern provinces. The answer is simple: The Ittihadists were looking for a pretext not to share the power with non-Turkish elements, and were looking for a scapegoat after the incompetent Enver Pasha lost the fateful battle of Sarikamis against Czarist Russia, and the Ottoman army was forced into a disorderly retreat.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-01-15,0
"Acting Russian President Putin Invites Leaders of Transcaucasus To Summit Meeting in Moscow Informed sources in Moscow have confirmed that acting Russian President Vladimir V. Putin has invited the three heads of state in the Transcaucasus for a summit meeting in the Russian capital. Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia flank the southernmost borders of Russia. An unidentified aide to president-elect Putin indicated that, over the last weekend, he held a brief telephone conversation with the Azeri president Heidar Aliev. According to Azeri officials in Moscow, the Azeri president has expressed reluctant acceptance to participate in such a conference. Last to sign on, according to Russian reports, was the president of Georgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze. Armenian president Robert Kocharian is assumed to have given his consent at the outset. The agenda of this meeting, to be held in coming weeks, has not been drafted yet. One pressing issue for acting president Putin is the ongoing war in Chechnya. All three Transcaucasian republics are playing some undisclosed role in this now protracted war. Most notably, according to Russian military sources, Georgia is harboring and providing logistic support to the Muslim fighters. Azerbaijan, on the other hand, is said to be facilitating the transfer of men and material offered by Turkey to the Chechen militants. Armenia, not sharing a common border with Russia, does not offer any significant strategic asset to other parties to the conflict. However, Yerevan's somewhat slight tilt towards Russia has caused consternation among its two other neighbors. Armenia's national borders are protected by some forty thousand Russian troops and this does not sit well either with Georgia or Azerbaijan. In recent months, Moscow has dispatched to Armenia some of its most modern weapons systems. President-elect Putin, a no-nonsense former KGB operative, paid a one-day visit to Armenia recently to personally express his condolences on the assassination of Prime Minister Vazken Sarkisian, Garen Demirchian, President of the National Assembly, and six other leading political leaders. At a time when he was in the initial stages of pursuing the war in Chechnya, this visit was viewed as a token appreciation of Yerevan's close links to Russia.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2000-01-08,0
"Diary of a Pilgrim In the spring of 1999 I had travel fever. I was trying to talk my husband and teenage son into traveling to Spain during the coming summer. When they both balked at the idea of leaving home during the most pleasant months of the year in our city weather-wise, I decided to take a trip without them. I had been planning this trip in my mind for many years, to travel across Turkey and visit the places whose names I had heard so often while growing up: Van, Gesaria (Kayseri) and, of course, Bolis (Istanbul). I had even cut out an article that I read in an English-language Armenian weekly newspaper in 1993 about a man, Armen Aroyan, who led groups to Turkey and Armenia. The itineraries for these tours were custom designed to fit the desires of the participants. It sounded like a good way to go. I picked up the telephone and called the number in the now yellowed article. The area code had changed, but I managed to track down Armen Aroyan. Armen told me that he was taking a group to Eastern Anatolia on June 25. He gave me a rough itinerary. It sounded perfect. He gave me the name of a local reference, someone from my city who had gone with him not once, but five or six times. When I called her, she gave rave reviews. I told him to count me in. My father was born in Constantinople in 1904 and lived there until he came to America at age 18. I had heard many stories from his youth and was familiar with a myriad of names: Pera, Kumkapi, the Getronagan School and the Shoogah (Grand Bazaar), to name a few. I wanted to see these places for myself. Although my father had never traveled into the interior of Turkey, his father had been born in Gesaria and Central Anatolia, and, as a young man, had traveled to Istanbul on foot to seek his fortune. My mother's father was from Van in Eastern Anatolia. His story was very similar to the story of the painter, Arshile Gorky, also from the Van area. Most of his family had perished during the 1915 Genocide. His mother had died of starvation. He had escaped to the United States and started a new life but a faraway look that sometimes crept into his eyes revealed a yearning for this place that he would never see again. I wanted to go there, to see Lake Van with my own eyes, which I had found so many times on the map. June 24, 1999. This morning my husband and son drive me to the Eugene airport for the short connecting flight to San Francisco. There I will board a non-stop flight from San Francisco to Munich, and after a one-hour layover there, fly on to Istanbul. Our group is going to be very small, only seven of us, the smallest group that Armen has taken to date. Including Armen, his Armenian guide and assistant Aghavni, and our Kurdish bus driver Cemal, we will be a total of 10 traveling across Turkey in a comfortable minibus. Another member of the group, Gladys Peters, is on my flights from San Francisco to Istanbul. While waiting for our international flight to board at S.F. International Airport, I have her paged so we can meet. We become fast friends. June 25, 1999. We land in Istanbul in the afternoon, buy our entry visas for $45 each and go through immigration without a hitch. Our contact person is waiting for us, holding a sign with the name of our hotel. He helps us get Turkish lira from the airport's ATM machine and takes us to our ride to the hotel. There is a message at the hotel desk that Ani, our Armenian guide, will meet us in the lobby at 7:00 p.m. That evening as we await Ani, we meet another member of our group, Dr. Robert Hewsen, a professor of Byzantine culture. Robert tells us that this is his second trip with Armen. Eighteen months ago, on his first trip, he swam in Lake Van. I congratulate myself for having packed my bathing suit. Before the trip is over I would understand why Armen has so many repeat customers. Ani arrives and takes us by taxi for dinner to Haci Abdullah, an Ottoman restaurant from the 1880's in the Pera area of Istanbul. While sampling an assortment of dishes, we meet Armen and more members of our group, including Dr. Dickran Kouymjian, Professor of Armenian Studies at California State University in Fresno, and his wife, Angele, originally from Paris. Some native Armenians of Istanbul dine with us. I sit next to a woman who is the principal of the Getronagan Lycee in Istanbul where my father attended. Tears come to my eyes as I tell her the story of how my father, whose family was very poor, had received a scholarship to attend Getronagan, and had walked several miles each way to school every day, and how he had to leave the school when he left with his family for America. June 26, 1999. I hear the call to prayer outside at 4:30 this morning. We rise shortly thereafter to get ready for our early-morning Turkish Airlines flight to Izmir. Another members of our group, Sonya Harlan, is meeting us at the airport. Sonya, an instructor of English and Armenian in Chicago, was born and raised in Istanbul, but this is only her second time back to Turkey in thirty years. During the course of the next week, Sonya's fluency in Turkish will prove to be useful to us. We arrive in Izmir and are met at the local airport by our trusty driver, Cemal, with the minibus that will be like home for the next two weeks. An hour later, Armen, Dickran, Angele and I are driving to Kasaba (now called Turgutlu) where Angele's mother was born and raised, to see if we can find her mother's old house. Kasaba is also Alex Manoogian's birthplace. With a population of about 20,000 in 1905, it is now a city of 80,000. The others in our group are spending time with Ani by the Izmir waterfront. Robert has taken a taxi to the area of Izmir where his father grew up. Time after time, we will find the former Armenian sectors of cities to be located in the oldest part of the city and now also the poorest. The children come out in full force, following us everywhere, wanting to get their picture taken. In Kasaba, several times I see storks in large nests made of straw built on rooftops. It brings back memories of the stories about storks in the old Armenian primes from which my father taught me to read Armenian. With a lot of imagination, one could imagine the thriving Armenian quarter, as it had once been, with small homes and the large Armenian church central in the neighborhood. The church in Kasaba is now a mosque. We return to Izmir, pick up the rest of our group, and head for Ephesus. On the way we stop at Meryem Ana Evi (Mary's House), the house where the Virgin Mary is reputed by tradition to have lived and died after Jesus's crucifixion. She supposedly lived to be 101 in this stone house. We spend the night at a waterfront hotel in Kusadsi, our rooms overlooking the Aegean, and dine on fish so fresh that they are swimming in a nearby tank until just after we order. The trial of the Kurdish PKK leader, Ocalan, is over, and we all await the verdict on June 29. June 27, 1999. We head to Ephesus, founded in the 11th century BC, though that part has not as yet been excavated. It once was a port city, but no more, since silt from the river has filled in the port. At the height of its glory, 200,000 people lived here. The theater is immense, seeming large enough to seat all 200,000. We are a little disappointed by Ephesus because so much of it is closed to tourists right now. After a stop in the town of Selcuk, we head east through Germencik by the Meander mountain chain to our south, through Aydin toward Nazilli. There are fresh peaches and watermelons at all the roadside stands. We take a short detour 3 km up a long hill to Nyssa, founded by Antiochus in the 3rd century BC, the site of a large amphitheater. There is a remarkable tunnel used to divert water from the theater and a good example of Roman engineering. But the highlight of the day is the archeological site of Aphrodisias near the town of Geyre. It is a very large site, newly discovered and excavated by a team from New York University. The stadium is incredible, built into the ground and very long. There are also the agora, bishop's house, bathhouses and a great theater. All this makes up for the disappointment of Ephesus and we celebrate by sharing a watermelon that we purchased earlier in the day. The weather is very hot and the landscape very dry. We cross a like today. The soil has so much iron in it that the take is a vivid pink. Truly amazing. We give a short ride to a British woman from Hawaii. She has been traveling alone all over Eastern Anatolia, visiting archeological sites. We spend the night in Denizli, a very large and pleasant city, whose claim to fame is the long drawn-out crowing of its roosters. June 28, 1999. Life appears to be very difficult in the interior. The land is desolate and dry. We pass many cherry trees, cherry pickers and cherry stands, as well as lots of poppies, dried and ready to be harvested and turned into opium. We are in the vicinity of Afyon, the opium capital of Turkey. There are many fields of sunflowers. We are headed north towards Konya. The police pull our bus over and accuse our driver of speeding, a bogus charge. He pays the equivalent of a $50 fine and they let us continue. We pass the outskirts of Konya, then pass through Novsehir and enter Cappadocia, an area with vivid rock formations caused by a volcano. In the Byzantine era the monks lived in the many caves in this region. We spend the night in a large, fancy hotel in Urgup in Cappadocia. There are no other tourists. Many foreign tour groups have cancelled this year due to the Ocalan trial. After dinner I walk the one kilometer to town. The moon is full and has lit up the rock caves surrounding the town. June 29, 1999. We visit the former Armenian neighborhood of Kayseri. Now it is the poorest section of town, and the little stone houses are in ruin. There are a few Turkish families living there, like squatters. There is a Kurdish man, who holds the key to the Armenian church and opens it for us. At one time there were several Armenian churches in Kayseri. The church we enter, St. Gregory the Illuminator, was built in the 15th - 16th centuries. It was renovated in 1885. There used to be a school next door to the church (Gumshian Varjaran). Robert tells us that the Armenians of Kayseri spoke Turkish because as one story goes, the sultan did not want to hear the Armenian language and threatened to cut out the tongues of any who spoke it. Suddenly I realize why my father used to speak Armenian to his mother and Turkish to his Gesaratsi father. On the hillside is Talas, the Beverly Hills of Kayseri, where the rich Armenians lived. The American College is located there on a beautiful site overlooking the city, but Americans no longer occupy it. At one time the missionaries were here and helped Armenians come to America. The Gulbenkian family was also from Talas, I later find out that this is where my grandfather was from. The population of Kayseri is now almost half a million. Before the Genocide, there were about 15,00 Armenians living there, with another 5,000 in Talas. I just ate my first mulberry. There were some Turkish men under the mulberry tree, picking. When we stopped and asked for some, one man said to the others, They are our grandfathers. Give them some. Apparently a lot of Turks acknowledge that their grandmothers were Armenian, alluding to the many Armenian girls kidnapped by Turks and forced to become their wives and bear their children. This morning we visited one of the caves with beautiful fresco paintings inside, where celibate monks once lived. Now we are driving through Pinarbash, population 11,000, on our way towards Malatya. The invisible border of historic Armenia is not far from here, between Pinarbash and the next town of size, Gurun. It is so desolate here. I have been marking our route on a roadmap to Turkey that I bought at one of our pit stops. This minibus has been the ideal way to see Turkey. No other tour would go to all of these places. There is a tiny beautiful river along this terrible road. We pass a group of women doing their wash in the river. There are tall posts on both sides of the road, marking it for times of heavy snowfall. Men are fishing in the river. The soil is very dry but very fertile, all volcanic. However, for anything to grow, it needs irrigation. It is typical to see no trees until we pass a village. We enter Gurun (once called Gorek), population 9,900, and find the old Armenian church. There is a storefront facade built onto it and it looks deceptively small from the outside. Someone lets us in. It is huge: it was once used as a movie theater by the Turks. Now its purpose is to store animal feed and lumber and it is in very poor shape. We stop at the Armenian church in Malatya. Malatya is a predominantly Kurdish city. The front door of the church is boarded up, but we enter through a hole in the side of the building. There is rubble inside, and outside, a large garden, probably once the cemetery. The former Armenian quarter is also a slum. Nothing has been kept up, and it's very sad. Near Malatya we cross the infamous Euphrates River. We stop for photographs. The sun is slowly setting. The light is beautiful. The countryside is much greener now. Cemal, our driver, tells us that Malatya has the best apricots in all of Turkey. Now we pass our first military checkpoint, twelve miles from Elazig, population 250,000, close to where we will spend the night. The Turks just wave us through. Our hotel is on Hazar Golu, or Lake Hazar. There is a once-in-a-lifetime magical moment that occurs. Four of us enter our hotel room and stride onto our adjoining balconies overlooking the lake at the exact moment that, from behind a hillside, the full moon begins to slowly rise over the lake. In her beautiful voice, Gladys sings Loosin Yelav (Moonrise). As she finishes her song, the moon peaks in the night sky and its light glistens across the lake. That night we dine on fresh fish from the lake at the hotel's outdoor restaurant. June 30, 1999. Today we climb the hill to the town of Harput. There is a fortress up here. We're seeing more of the women fully covered in their traditional black garb (charshaf). This is an almost wholly Kurdish town. From here east, the population will be all Kurdish. We stop at the ruins of the Surp Hagop Church, then at Surp Garabed. Ten minutes from here is Hussenig (now called Ulukent) where some old Armenian homes are left. We stop at St. Barbara Church, a pile of rubble that was once the Armenian church. Only one wall remains standing. We travel east to Mush and drive with a military escort up a mountainside to Surp Garabed, a church and monastery from the 4th century. At one time this was the most sacred pagan site of ancient Armenia. The Mush plain is below us, the cradle of Armenia. There were once over 300 Armenian villages here. The snowcapped Taurus Mountains are in the distance, creating a beautiful setting. This site was abandoned in 1915 and remained so until 1960 when the Turkish government settled Kurds here. The Kurds used remnants of the Armenian church to build their homes. We see Armenian inscriptions on the stones that are now part of the existing buildings. The people are very kind. Some of the old churches are now barns for their farm animals. Tonight we spend the night in a hotel in Mush. A local Armenian man joins us for dinner and tells us his history. He speaks only Turkish and is a Muslim. His grandfather was married off to a Turkish man, but she hanged herself. Her son, this man's father, went to an orphanage and then was taken in by a rich Kurdish family. Eventually they found him an Armenian girl to marry. July 1, 1999. We travel to Bitlis, population 51,000 - William Saroyan's family's ancestral home. It is situated at an elevation of about 5,000 feet. The Armenian church here is now used by the government liquor monopoly to store their inventory. We are not allowed to enter the church. We stop by the Bitlis River, which runs near the city. It is about 163 kilometers to Van. At Tatvan we catch the first glimpse of the beautiful blue waters of Lake Van. There are mountains all around us as we drive along the lake. I see a lot of beehives and bee collectors. Also hay harvested and tied in rolled bundles. There are a few tents of nomads here and there. From Gevash we take a boat to the island of Akhtamar. The water is clean and invigorating and I go for a swim. I wonder if my grandfather once come onto this island and also swam in these waters. I'm sure of it. The Holy Cross Church on the island is relatively well preserved. The outside designs are wonderful motifs - animals and Christian personages renown. Inside the church, remnants of paintings on the walls are still visible. Tonight at dinner we sample tarekh fish that is only found in Lake Van. July 2, 1999. We are spending two nights in the city of Van, population about 230,000. Our hotel is well situated near shops and great bakeries and pastry shops. Today we are on a day trip, driving along what was once the main caravan route from Van to Iran. At Albayrak is the church of St. Bartholomew, but the soldiers do not let us enter the church. We only have permission to photograph it from the outside. Again the Kurdish villagers are kind. They invite us into their homes and offer us tan, a thick yogurt-like drink made from sheep's milk. We pass through a myriad of military checkpoints. The Turkish soldiers are very nervous about the verdict in the Ocalan trial. They are expecting the Kurdish insurgents to swoop down from the hills any day and engage them in battle. They tell us that, for this reason, the road back to Van is closed to traffic after 3 p.m., but after much persuading we are allowed to return to our hotel. We stop at the old city of Van, which is all destroyed now. Tonight we go shopping and several members of our group buy rugs. July 3, 1999. Before leaving Van we stop at the Van Museum. On the second floor there is an Armenian Genocide section where the Turks acknowledge the genocide. However, they have it backwards as the statements try to convince us that the Armenians massacred the Turks. I don't know whether to laugh or be disgusted. We eat lunch at the beautiful waterfall at Muradiye. The land we are traversing now is very sparsely populated. Sheep are a mainstay. The women occupy themselves with the washing and drying of wool. There used to be buffalo and reindeer here, but they are now extinct, although they are still used as motifs on rugs. There are military checkpoints about every twenty minutes here. We are close to the Iranian and Armenian borders, headed ever closer to Mt. Ararat. We'll be spending the night in Igdir, a jumping-off point for visiting the ghost city of Ani tomorrow. We stop at Ishak Pasha's palace, a gingerbready palace in the mountains. Legend has it that the architect was an Armenian, and when he finished the building, the chieftain cut off his hands so he could never design anything more spectacular. Just as the sun is setting, we stop on a deserted side road to photograph the fabulous view of Mt. Ararat. July 4, 1999. We drive to Kars to get the required permission to visit the site of Ani. It is a formality that takes about thirty minutes. On the way we stop at the town of Digor (Tegor) to see the remains of the Armenian church there. Only one wall of stone is left. The road from Kars to Ani has been newly renovated. There is a lot of action at Ani, known as the city of 1,001 churches, although in reality the number was more like 140. There is a beautiful view of the Marco Polo Bridge where the famous Silk Road crossed the Akhurian (Arpa) River. After spending several hours in Ani, we drive bong the Arax River to Erzurum where we will spend the night. The sun is setting and the light is beautiful. The landscape is very green with rolling hills. July 5, 1999. Today we pass some of the most spectacular scenery of this trip - deep gorges and canyons surrounded by huge rock faces. Our bus climbs a narrow road up to the hillside town of Ardanush and then to Artvin. We continue on to Rize for the night. July 6, 1999 - We drive to Samsun by way of Trabzon and Ordu, along the Black Sea coast. At Samsun we drive to the former Armenian quarter where the mother of Dr. Dickran had lived. People in the neighborhood point out what had once been the Armenian Church and tell us that an old house still standing was where the church's caretaker used to live. Everyone in the neighborhood is very friendly to us. A boy of about 15, who speaks English, directs us to a spot with a spectacular view of Samsun. It is a very uplifting experience for us all. He also suggests a restaurant situated directly on the Black Sea. Our last night together as a group is celebratory. We drink cognac and dance. July 7, 1999. We board our flight from Samsun to Istanbul. I will spend the next several days visiting my father's old neighborhood and the schools that he attended, as well as the tourist sites of Istanbul. I think of how different my life would have been had my father and his family not immigrated to the United States. I feel badly for the Armenians who, as they put it, were left behind. The Armenians in the Diaspora look down on them for being Turkified, although to me it is no different than being Americanized. And the Turks don't consider them Turkish. They are like the man without a country. I highly recommend this trip for anyone interested in exploring his or her Armenian ancestry, or even just getting a close-up view of Easter Turkey. We traveled 2,600 miles overland, literally from one side of Turkey to the other. Armen Aroyan is a very experienced group leader. His hotel and restaurant choices are always top-notch. I guarantee that this will be a journey you will remember for the rest of your life. If you are even remotely interested, don't wait. For dates of upcoming trips, Mr. Aroyan can be reached at (626) 359-9510 or via e-mail at: aroyan@earthlink.net.

"Nationalist Forces in Turkey Are Now Questioning Whether EU Membership is Worth the Cost Although Turkey's application for membership in the European Union was accepted on December 10 of this year, nationalist Turks and hard-line military representatives in the Turkish National Security Council are questioning whether they really want to be part of the European Union. This reluctance has to do with the strict criteria and requirements for EU membership. Prior to Turkey's formal and final admission, Turks have to come up with many changes in the legal field, specifically constitutional, civil, human and minority rights. In addition, there are issues of democracy and politics that must satisfy demands of the EU, OSCE, European Commission, European Council of Ministers, and Parliament. Along with this, Turkey was asked to make a constructive contribution to the settlement of all disputes with various neighboring countries by peaceful means in accordance with international law. This is why Prime Minister of Turkey Bulent Ecevit responded very bluntly to visiting Javier Solana, the European Union representative, when he stated, There may be details that are hard for us to digest. Indeed, the devil is in those details. EU FOCUSING ON SHORTCOMINGS EU member states, under Article 57 of the European Convention of Human Rights, called on Turkey to show how domestic laws ensure the effective implementation of any of the provisions of this convention. Before waiting for the answer, the EU Council is focusing on Turkey's numerous shortcomings, coming up with a series of questions and recommendations, and asking for the implementation of the principles of the European Council and OSCE without delay. To be more specific, Europeans are asking Turks to eliminate the Turkish Military's influence through the Turkish National Security Council, whereby generals are controlling the political system, approving or disapproving political appointees in the judiciary and emergency court system in the country, particularly in the Kurdish regions. The generals also control and regulate activities in academia and in the universities, in the news media, public broadcasting, religious affairs, civic life, trade unions - in short, every aspect of Turkish society. Europeans are very critical of Turkey's censorship of the press and the harassment or police violence perpetrated against individual journalists, arbitrary detention and imprisonment of political dissidents and human rights activist like Mr. Akim Birdal, as well as torture and political murders while in prison. The situation regarding the freedom of association and freedom of assembly has also been scrutinized and criticized by the European Council report, which cites the closing down of the Turkish Human Rights Association for an indefinite period the emergency courts run by military judges. As far as freedom of religion is concerned, according to the Europeans, there still exists a difference in treatment between those religious minorities recognized by the Lausanne Treaty (Armenian Apostolic, Greek Orthodox) and other religious minorities (Hamshins, who are Armenian-speaking Muslims, Suryanis, Donmes-Muslim Jews, Muslim Georgians-Laz, Sufis,, Bektashis, Alevi or Kizilbash Kurds). Even the majority of Sunni Turks who acknowledge the five pillars of Islam are complaining of religious discrimination, since the banning of the Islamic fundamentalist Refah party; followers of this brand of Islam are also persecuted, and now they are taking their cause to the European Council. This is ironic but real. Why are the Turkish nationalists and generals against so-called fundamentalism? It is not out of concern over violation of secular principles, but mostly due to their desire to eliminate the concept of Islam's universality in which Kurdish and Turkish Muslims would be equals in the eyes of Allah (God Almighty). EQUALITY VS. TURKISM This notion of equality contradicts the principles of Turkism, according to which everyone is considered to be Turk, through assimilation or conversion. The Turkish daily Sabah (Morning) goes even further in articulating the Muslim concerns: We have to strive to defeat organized crime (gangsters assassinating political opponents, dissidents with collusion of state apparatus - MA), torture, inflation, corruption and darkness (not enlightened by Islamic principles - MA). Our problem is not Helsinki (where Turkey's EU candidacy was accepted - MA) but Ankara. Professor Ilber Ortayli, an Ottoman historian from the University of Ankara, was also pessimistic when he stated, Many people think that if we join the European Union, within three days we will have a British-style Parliament. We have a kind of naive hysteria for the European Union. The editor in chief of the Turkish Daily News was more blunt in his views: Turkey's democratic structure does not live up to the standards of Europe. Long-suffering Western-oriented Turkish intellectuals are hoping and praying that if the EU accepts Turkey as member, many of the taboos will be open for discussion, and the long expected reforms in democracy, judiciary, constitution, civil and human rights, minority and religious rights will be open for discussion. TURKS' INTEREST IN EU ONESIDED Yet Turkish political elite and generals are mostly interested in that aspect of European Union membership which has to do with economic and commercial benefit. They are cool and reserved toward political reform, part of the EU requirements that membership will demand. After all, the generals witnessed what political restructuring and pluralism brought to the USSR: dissolution of the monolithic empire, loss of central control, fragmentation of the once mighty state and military apparatus, and the declaration of independence by all constituent republics. Firsthand experience with the demise of the Ottoman Empire, and an analogous comparison of the multiethnic Turkish State with the former USSR are raising hairs in nationalistic circles. Is it possible that Turks, Kurds, Circassians, Laz, Sunni Muslims and Alevis, and Suryanis are going to be able to restructure a multicultural, multiethnic and religiously diverse new democratic Turkey, not for only Turks but all ancient Anatolian cultures? Is it possible that Turks will make a constructive contribution to the settlement of all disputes with all neighboring countries by peaceful means in accordance with international law? Can the Turks establish a just peace in the Greek Cypriot region and in the Kurdish regions of Turkey? Can they refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of Iraq with sizable Turkish minorities living in Suleymaniye and Kirkuk? By the same token, can they refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of Iran, where 15 million Azeris live in the northern region, and make peace with the Armenians and accept the unique status of the Armenian region of Karabagh? Are they going to accept accountability for the confiscation of Armenian lands and properties, or the Armenian Genocide? EU DEMANDS ON TURKEY The EU is also asking Ankara to: (1) abolish the death penalty (in reference to PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan); (2) more strictly observe human rights protocols, in light of torture, jailing of dissidents, human rights advocates, and journalists for their writings being common occurrences; (3) reform the role of the military that has staged four coups d'etat in the past four decades and still now dominates the government through the Turkish National Security Council; (4) improve the economy and stem inflation since Turkey is considered to be the poorest nation in Europe; and, lastly, improve relations with her immediate neighbors. Acceptance of Turkey by Europe is part of Turkish reformers' dreams since the time of Sultan Mahmut II in 1839-1876, the ill-fated and misguided Young Turk movement in 1908-1918, and the Kemalist revolution since 1920. Pioneers of the democratic reform movement in 1960-1970 and participants of the short-lived intellectual revolt and ethnic awakening against rigid state control in 1980's sought to bring Western values to Turkish society. Yet the leaders of the democratic movement were all purged; the elected government and leaders were all deposed through military interventions and coups. Recent attempts to bring about peace and harmony between the Kurds and the Turks through the universal religion of Islam in 1997 were also aborted by the military; the legitimately elected Necmedin Erbakan government was forced out of office, and his Islamic party was closed. Conditional and state-controlled democracies in the former Communist countries of the Eastern European bloc and the former USSR, which used to be called people's democracies, all failed and collapsed. The military regimes, which professed to be practicing controlled democracy in South America, the Caribbean, Southeastern Asian and African regions, also caved in. Either you have a democracy or you don't. The term controlled democracy is a smokescreen for rulers who pretend to be practicing democracy according to their interpretation, but whose aim is to maintain the status quo without real democratization, reforms or commitment of human rights. Their goal is to maintain their control over the masses and protect their own personal, family, clan, or political elite's ideological interests. They are not prepared to share power with anyone through the honest election process. COSMETIC CHANGES NOT THE SOLUTION The solution does not lie in making cosmetic changes, like granting Christian minorities, particularly the Armenians, the right to renovate their institutional properties through painting or face-lifting churches and schools. It is difficult for anyone in the US or Europe to imagine that permission for such routine upkeep had to be obtained from the state prior to December 10, 1999 - the date of acceptance of Turkey's candidacy to EU. Yet these kinds of permits were required, and their intent was to bring about the deterioration of Armenian properties in order to Gradually phase out the Armenian presence. One wonders if the Turks will now permit the restoration of the Armenian architectural jewels in Eastern Anatolia. The answer is probably no! The Foreign Minister of Turkey gave a very bold answer to European critics when he stated, Turkey is no ordinary candidate and is determined to join the EU without sacrificing its unique blend of east-west persuasion. But in order to prevent further criticism, he acknowledged, Deep changes are needed if Turkey wants to rid itself of the stigma of human rights abuses. He immediately drew the line when it came to the issue of Kurdish cultural rights, stating We are not in the business of creating privileged minorities. Up to this date, Turkey continues to outlaw Kurdish-language education and broadcasting as potentially divisive measures. The Turks want the Europeans to understand this clearly. On the other hand, Ankara wants to be sure that Turks living in Germany, Bulgaria, Greece or any other part of Europe have full cultural rights, including Turkish-language instruction in schools, broadcasting and publications in the Turkish language. Turks want the best of both worlds: economic integration and trade benefits from the EU, and protection of the civic, political and cultural rights of Turkish nationals living in various European countries. But when it comes to Turkey itself, Ankara wants the Europeans to understand that 15 million Kurds are not going to have the cultural rights that the EU is hoping for, since they believe that Turkey is a unique blend of the East and West. The Ottoman Turks used to ask what form of service you want to have or what kind of music you want to hear - a la Franca or a la Turqa, the choice is yours.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-12-25,0
"Do Europe and Turkey Have Anything in Common? In order to keep up with European civilization, the Turks tried to bring political reforms to the ailing Ottoman Empire. This is known as the history of the era of `Tanzimat' (Reorganization) 1839 -1876. Following the declaration of `Hatti Humayum' (Imperial rescript) by Sultan Mahmut II on November 3, 1839, the decree states: If security of property lacks, and people are not free from anxiety, no one cares for his state or his `millet' (nation), or works for the building of prosperity. On the other hand, if the situation is the opposite, that is, if property is fully secure, then the individual will care for his own affairs and his zeal for state and `millet' and love of motherland will increase daily. Amazingly, the decree also mandated to protect individual rights: Hereafter, until the pleas of the criminal are examined and adjudged publicly, in accordance with the laws of the `Seriat' (Islamic canon law), no one shall be executed, secretly or publicly. No one may attack the reputation and honor of another. REFORMS SHORT-LIVED Unfortunately, this era of reforms, when the Turks were attempting to look like and live like Europeans, didn't last long as the bloody despotic reign of Abdulhamit II (Red Sultan) started in 1876. Under the Red Sultan, political suppression, spying on citizens, persecution of dissidents, arbitrary arrest and execution of innocent people, abuse of subjects, and persecution and wholesale massacres of the Armenians in Adana and Zeitoun occurred. The Red Sultan, frustrated with losing lands in the Balkans and facing opposition from the newly emerging Young Turk political movement, turned to one of the minorities that had not sought to revolt against the Sultan, the Armenians. There had been no problems with the Armenians previously since they had been integrated completely into Ottoman society. The era of reforms initiated by Sultan Mahmut II was abandoned and the era of bloody suppression of Adulhamit II was in full swing, with the hope of integration into European civilization buried in the pages of history. The German-educated Young Turks, who were admirers of autocratic German militarism in order to carry out their national objectives and ideology - Pan-Turkism (to unify all Turkic - speaking nations from the Balkans to the Central Asia, from the Arabia to Russia and China) began to challenge the Red Sultan's regime. Their idea of being equal to European civilization was not in their culture but was rather a quest for political and military modernization. The Young Turks' idols were German militarists and fascists, and their idea of modernization was to get rid of Christian minorities, particularly the Armenians, in order to create a homogenous Ottoman state made up of only Muslim and Turkic stock. In their initial quest to power, they first asked for the deposition of the Read Sultan and his replacement by a constitutional and representative government - `Mistreated' (Constitutional Monarchy.) MOST BLOODY PERIOD The Young Turk Revolution finally deposed the Red Sultan and the Young Turk period began, extending from 1908 to 1918. This era was a most bloody period of the declining Ottoman state. Colorful words and promises, like freedom of press and political association, democratization, protection of minority rights, and reforms in the provinces, never materialized; instead, a monolithic, dictatorial, and fascist regime was created, and the anticipation of WWI gave a new pretext and impetus to the triumvirate of Enver, Talat and Djemal pashas, to consolidate their power and to execute their preconceived plans, to enter the war on the side of Germany and to defeat Russia, in order to eliminate the major obstacle to the creation of the neo-Ottoman Empire II. For this, the plan of Enver, Talat, Djemal, Behaeddin Sakir and Ziya Gokalp was clear: the creation of a more vibrant and homogenous new empire stretching from the existing Ottoman lands to the newly conquered lands in the east. These geographical areas included Turkic - inhabited southern Russian lands, Caucasus, Central Asia, and the Turkic - inhibited Chinese land of Uighur province. Meanwhile, they also tried to secure their control in the Balkans and Arabia as well. The implementation and initiation of the Armenian Genocide under the cover of the WWI started in 1915, in order to execute the premeditated, preplanned master plan, preconceived in 1907 during secret meeting of the Young Turk hierarchy, attended only by a handful of Pan-Turkists, with slogans like Empire for Turks Only. DREAMS SHATTERED WWI ended with the defeat of Imperial Germany and the Ottoman Empire. The dream of the political reforms, Pan-Turkism, and creation of neo-Ottoman Empire or, more accurately, Greater Turania (home of all Turkic-speaking nations) was shattered. Former Ottoman lands, and capital of the Empire, Istanbul, were now under foreign occupation, and plans to partition Ottoman territory were under way. Now the Turks themselves were fighting for their national survival, in the land where the ethnic cleansing of the Armenians was completed. The Turkish nationalists, under Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Ataturk), rejected the American mandate, European intervention, and the treaty of Sevres, and conducted a successful war of liberation and independence against British, French, Italian and Greek occupiers with Bolshevik help, between 1918-1920. Once the Turks won their war of independence, a new era of Kemalism started. Mustafa Kemal was also a dictator but he was more or less a benevolent dictator, and a great reformer. He managed to inject self-confidence into the masses. He gave the nation a new alphabet and dress code, liberated women, established secular law, eliminated the power of ignorant mullahs, abolished foreign economic control, nationalized critical industry, including railroads and shipping under the control of foreigners, stimulated education, and conducted prudent foreign policy. Yet his attempt to bring Turkey up to European standards also failed. TURKEY FOR TURKS ONLY Being ultra-nationalist, he was flanked by the former members of Young Turk political movement, who were involved directly with Armenian deportations, massacres and final solution - the Armenian Genocide - and who adhered to the principles of monolithic homogenous state, Turkey for Turks only. All the ethnic or religious minorities, including remnants of the Armenians, Armenian-speaking but Hamshins, Laz, Zazas, Kurds, Yezidis, Greeks, Suryanis, Alavis, Sufis, Bektasis, Turkmans, Albanians, Circassians, and Boshnaks are thought to present themselves as Turks. The multiethnic and multicultural Ottoman mosaic was overtaken by forced monolithic and uniform society through assimilation and conversion. While the US, the former USSR, and Europe created multi-ethnic, multi-religious and multi-linguistic state structures, the leaders of the Turkish Republic did their outmost to discourage this course, and until 1950 control was maintained through the one-party system, CHP (Republican Party). The period between 1950 and 1960 represented the so-called `democratic years which began after the National Assembly elected Celal Bayar as President, Adnan Menderes, deputy from Istanbul, as Prime Minister, and Fuad Koprulu as Foreign Minister. In addition, the multiparty system and plurality were tolerated. In order to secure Turkey's membership in the Western alliance and integrate their ailing economy with the West, the Turks agreed to make some cosmetic concessions. It is fair to say that some limited political pluralism, human rights, freedom of speech and expression, news media, and publications, to the extent permitted by the rules and regulations imposed by the military. MENDERES OVERTHROWN When the Kurds became very active and took control of municipalities and mayoral jobs under the Democratic Party, nationalist forces and the military became alarmed. Fighting between Democrats-DP and Republicans-CHP gave pretext to the army to overthrow the constitutionally elected Menderes government on May 27, 1960 and thus the experience with democracy came to its end. This democratic experiment was replaced with a conditional democracy, which was supervised, dictated, and regulated by the powerful generals. General Djemal Gursel was elected President, the National Unity Committee was formed in 1960-1961 and a new constitution was adapted. Since Turkey became a member of NATO in 1952, and because of its strategic location, the US and Western countries placed their national and economic interests above their principles. In the main, they closed their eyes to human rights, minority rights, and the violations of democratic principles in Turkey. Encouraged by this, the generals made a habit out of throwing any government or political leader out of office if the so-called principles of Kemalism were violated. The so-called practicing democracy became conditional on certain requirements set according to the afore-mentioned rules. From 1960 to the present we have witnessed many coups d'etat - 1971, 1980, 1997 (the latter, forceful ouster of Prime Minister Erbakan). Any reference to the Kurdish rights, Armenian history and the Armenian Genocide, or criticism of Kemalism, undue influence and control over society by the generals or practice of religious fundamentalism met with stiff resistance from the ruling political elite, and the generals were punishable with jail sentences. Despite the activism of the flourishing new Turkish intellectuals, who became exposed to Western ideas and cultures, their struggle to reform the outdated Turkish legal code, in order to eliminate man-made artificial restrictions against the creation of a multiethnic and multicultural society, again was discouraged with stiff penalties and jail sentences. Once the rules were loosened and free expression was permitted, the unprepared Turkish society was plunged into political and civil chaos: feuding between leftist and rightist forces ended with thousands of killings; sectarian violence and so-called Kurdish separatist activities left 5,000 dead by 1980. This was again followed by coup d'etat and political repression. MORE POWER TO THE GENERALS In 1982 again, the constitution was revised to give more say to the generals. Political suppression led to the Kurdish struggle in 1988 whose proponents began asking for their rights as far as maintaining their culture and using their language was concerned, or requesting permission to have Kurdish broadcasts, newspapers and other publications. The Kurdish leaders were accused of separatism, charged with treason, and put in prison, or they were physically eliminated by the death squads who were on the interior ministry's payroll. Between 1988 and 1999, bombing of the Kurdish villages, forceful deportation, relocation and massacre of its ethnic populace and physical elimination of the Kurdish leadership was in full swing. The Kurdish war claimed 35,000 dead, 30,000 of them ethnic Kurds and 5,000 of them government soldiers. After all these setbacks and historical experiences, when the Turks were finally invited to apply to European Union on December 10th 1999, there was no jubilation in Turkey, since this invitation will require the Turks to meet certain criteria, which the Turkish generals will be unable to meet. Europeans want to be sure that Turks will comply with European standards; in establishing democracy, protecting human rights, abolishing the death penalty, and building a civil society based on law. Already right-wing nationalist partners of the present Turkish government coalition are rejecting these values. Why? The reasons are obvious; they don't want to grant equal rights to the non-Turkic populace, or freedom of using the Kurdish language in schools, broadcasts, and publications, or granting cultural rights to ethnic and minority groups. They are against creating a real pluralistic society, which may slip out of the control of the generals, and which may challenge and threaten the fundamental principles of the creation of Turkey for Turks only. Prime Minister of Turkey Bulent Ecevit responded very bluntly to visiting Javier Solana, the European Union representative, when he stated, There may be details that are hard for us to digest, but in general the acceptance of our candidacy on equal terms is a great success for Turkey. Are the Turks really going to digest, comply and become a member of civilized world? Are they going to accept responsibility for their past misconduct or - as they have done previously - avoid any accountability and continue the occupation of Cyprus, deny cultural rights to the Kurds, and deny responsibility for the Armenian Genocide? Are they going to be a peaceful nation or are they going to continue to pursue an aggressive policy of pan-Turkism? President Demirel's statement that the year of 2000 will be the year of the Turkic world stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Great Wall of China is a threatening message to the Balkan nations, Armenia, Russia, Iran and China.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-12-18,0
"Armenia After the Coming of Islam: New Book by Antranig Chalabian Historian Antranig Chalabian, author of General Andranik and the Armenian Revolutionary Movement and Revolutionary Figures, has now come out with a comprehensive volume entitled Armenia After the Coming of Islam. This book is about Arabic, Persian, Byzantine Greek, Seljuk Turkish, Turkoman, Mongol-Tatar, and Ottoman Turkish history, all in conjunction with Armenian history. In the jacket notes, Chalabian writes, The research and writing of Armenia after the Coming of Islam was begun in the mid-1980s under a different title, but the work was interrupted for some years. He cites the publication and multiple printings of General Andranik (four in Armenian and one in English), its English translation and publication, and then his study of the heroic struggle of the Armenian haiduks (freedom fighters) in the mountains of Sassoun, entitled Revolutionary Figures, and its two printings, as the reasons why the completion of his latest book was delayed. The author continues, Finally, in 1994, I resumed my research and writing on the subject that was titled Armeno-Turkish Relations during the Centuries. In the 1990s I had second thoughts about this title, because I realized that our relations and problems were not only with the Turks, but other nations as well. I therefore changed the title to Armenia after the Coming of Islam. Armenia after the Coming of Islam covers the period between the seventh up to the early nineteenth centuries. It is about Armenia's relations with the Arabs who ruled most of Armenia for 245 years (A.D. 640-885), the Persians, the Byzantine Greeks, the Seljuk Turks, the Turkomans, the Mongol-Tatars, and, finally, the Ottoman Turks. After about six years of work, Dr. Chalabian now offers Armenia after the Coming of Islam, a book of 608 pages, 10 maps, 24 pictures, bibliography and index, to those who are interested in Armenian history, the history of our ancestors. In the author's words, I think that Armenians after the Coming of Islam will be an important book for the English-speaking Armenians of the western hemisphere because knowledge of the experiences and relationships with our Muslim and non-Muslim neighbors during the past centuries will help us develop better and more solid relations with them in the future. Ignorance of what happened in the past could lead to political pitfalls in the future, with catastrophic consequences. Copies of Armenia after the Coming of Islam, priced at $35 plus $3 shipping and handling ($5 outside the USA), may be ordered directly from the author: Dr. Antranig Chalabian, 17264 Melrose St., Southfield, MI 48075-4227.

"Why Blood Is Flowing in the Caucasus, Not Black Oil This article was written prior to the OSCE Summit held in Istanbul this past Wednesday and Thursday. Host country Turkey has great expectations from the OSCE summit in Istanbul, hoping that the following will materialize: 1) Turkey is a regional superpower and has the power to shape the geopolitics in the Balkans, Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia. 2) Turkey is also in control of energy transportation routes. Turkey has to be militarily strong to protect not only energy sources and pipelines, but also its own national interests, and to project its military and geopolitical power beyond its borders. TURKEY FLEXING ITS MUSCLES Turkey is about to become a police state in the region, and is poised to undermine Russia and Iran's influence. In order to be able to flex its muscles in the event of confrontation with other regional powers, Turks vow to spend $35 billion for ambitious military modernization programs, which include the purchase of a $2-billion airborne early-warning system, a $4-billion-dollar fleet of 145 attack helicopters, a $7-billion-dollar order for 1,000 main battle tanks, and the modernization of their air force and navy. The list of items includes 67 tons Abrams M1A2 main battle tanks, 240 F-16 warplanes, and 1700 armored personnel carriers. The list also includes Patriot missiles to intercept incoming ballistic missiles. Turkey wants to acquire a first - strike capability and build nuclear energy stations so that in the future it will have the potential of developing nuclear weapons and join the nuclear club. Turks make no secret that, in order to bring Azeri oil from Baku to the Turkish loading station at the port in Ceyhan, a final peace agreement among the warring parties, Armenia and Azerbaijan, is a must; otherwise, oil companies won't invest $3-4 billion near the Karabagh conflict zones. Every effort was made to finalize peace agreements in the Istanbul summit; a lot of arm twisting, pressure tactics, financial incentives, and political backing were promised to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. These efforts caused concern in Russia over losing control of this important region. They also caused alarm in nationalistic circles in Azerbaijan, which are vowing not to recognize any peace agreement that loosen Azeri control over Karabagh. WORRIES IN ARMENIA AND NKR Patriots in Armenia and NKR are also worried that this agreement might jeopardize their security and quest for independence. Obviously, the blueprints of this agreement are tailored to meet the requirements of maintaining peace and stability in the region so that the necessary financial investments may be made for the oil and natural gas pipelines to become a reality, rather than to satisfy the national interests of Armenians or Azeris. For well over thirty days now, the Russian army has been pounding Chechnya with artillery, tanks, and precision bombs from the air, simulating NATO tactics in Yugoslavia, in order to force the Chechens to sue for peace on Russian terms. Russia wants to maintain its control over the oil and natural gas resources, and energy transportation routes as well. In order to deny Russia victory, certain sources are continuing to finance Chechen war efforts, and providing them the necessary military training and equipment to sustain a war of attrition against Russia. Wahabis from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and millionaire terrorist Osama ben Laden from Afghanistan are bankrolling the Chechens, and Islamic fundamentalist volunteers from Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Arabia are pouring in to conduct a Holy War against the infidel Russians. Yet Russia and Turkey recently signed an agreement to fight against terrorism and separatism, naturally on the basis of their terms and understanding. The Kurds are a headache for the Turks, just as the Chechens are for the Russians. BAKU BECOMING ISLAMIC HUB Yossef Bodansky, who is senior editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs' Strategic Policy, wrote an interesting article, The New Azerbaijan Hub, which appeared in the journal's October 1999 issue. According to the author, World Assembly of Islamic Youth, The International Organization of Islamic Salvation, and Al-Ibrahim Foundation have established headquarters in Baku where Islamic fundamentalist terrorists are indoctrinated and trained to conduct terrorist activities and subversion in the Caucasus, Central Asia, and even in Russia proper. Their aim is to carve up the Islamic states in territories controlled by Russia, like Chechnya, Dagestan, Ingushetia, Chuvashia, Kabardino Balkaria, and even Tataristan. Their agenda also is to liberate the Muslim territory of Karabagh from Armenian occupation. They are also conducting subversion in the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. According to the author, the team of Islamic Jihad traveled twice to Baku, to the Azerbaijani-Dagestani and Azerbaijani-Chechen borders, and carefully studied the situation on the ground. Terrorists like Chechen Shamil Basayev, Saudi Osama ben Laden, Jordanian Khattab, and Turkish citizen Rejeb Yeghid and many others are conducting organized joint efforts to promote terrorism and subversion to undermine the present order. Their aim is based on many factors, like serving the cause of Islamic fundamentalism, to carry on a war of liberation in the regions of Muslims who they perceive to be under the yoke of infidels or secular governments who are the puppets of the US or Russia. BETWEEN RUSSIA & THE NATO POWERS According to Anno Hellenbroich's essay, which appeared in the 11/5/99 issue of Executive Intelligence Review under the title of bloodbath in Armenia Creates Power Vacuum, the terrorist attack took place (in the Armenian parliament) during the period when the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia met four times, under considerable American pressure, to try to find an agreement in the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict. On October 15, 1999, Iravunk (Rights), the largest Armenian opposition newspaper, quoted US Vice President Al Gore who urged Armenia for its own good to come to an agreement with Azerbaijan before the OSCE's Istanbul summit on November 17-18. The author continues, Iravunk situated this letter in the context of sensational new oil discoveries in Iran, and negotiations between Russia and Iran over a possible pipeline that would cross Armenian territory. The author adds, with quotation from Iravunk, This would conflict with plans for an Azeri oil pipeline from Baku, Azerbaijan, to the Turkish loading station at the port in Ceyhan. Finally the author concludes, With the assault on the Armenian Parliament, the British `Great Game' (alluding to the Russian-British rivalry in the nineteenth century to control Afghanistan, Persia and India - M.A.) has produced new corpses on the battlefield of the Transcaucasus, and has thrust Armenia into the midst of a contest between Russia and the NATO powers. Strobe Talbott's visit to Baku coincided with the forced resignation of Azeri Foreign Minister Tofig Zulfigaro and Vafa Gulizade, the foreign affairs advisor of Azeri President Heydar Aliyev. Talbott reportedly gave the message of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Aliyev and praised him for his statesmanship and leadership for the forthcoming Karabagh negotiations. The European Union has been critical of Azerbaijan for not meeting its obligations to cooperate with Armenia in EU-sponsored projects in the South Caucasus. With a carrot-and-stick policy, the US and the West are trying hard to bring the parties of the conflict into agreement. Talbott came to Armenia with the same message but, one hour after his departure, the top leadership of Armenia was assassinated. HASTY AGREEMENT TO BE AVOIDED According to the Russian newspaper Kommersan's 11/6/99 issue Russia rescued the Karabagh conflict resolution from a hasty conclusion. The newspaper claims that, during his Moscow visit, Robert Kocharian, President of Armenia, was urged by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin not to take hasty decisions in the middle of the Karabagh conflict resolution. According to this newspaper, signing an agreement with Azerbaijan under duress may jeopardize the future of Karabagh. Vahe Kaprielian, President Kocharian's spokesman, stated in Moscow that Russia, as cochairman and regional power, is interested in the final solution of the Karabagh conflict. He later continued, I would like to remind all of President Robert Kocharian's previous statements that he was not going to OSCE's Istanbul summit with the intention of putting his signature on a final Karabagh peace agreement. The presence of Defense Minister General Vagharshak Harutunian was very significant since the leadership of Armenia's armed forces is very upset with Armenia's civilian leadership. Tiny Armenia, Karabagh, and Azerbaijan are now being pulled in many directions by the different power centers for the control of oil and natural gas resources and transportation routes. For this, competing power centers are trying to establish military and political control over the region which has strategic and geopolitical importance. The victor, in turn, will determine the future of the region and destiny of many nations in the next millennium. If the effort were made to find a just solution to attain peace and harmony in order to improve the lives of the impoverished population of the region, no one would have an objection. Alas, all efforts are being directed to gain advantage over others, for maximum geopolitical, military, and economic control at the expense of other interested parties. As long as the cold-war mentality prevails, the resolution of the Karabagh problem will remain complex and unattainable in the near future. The bloodbath in Armenia is part of this contest between Russia and the NATO powers.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-11-20,0
"Dikranagerd/Urfa Conference at UCLA to Bring Together Senior and New-Generation Scholars New-generation scholars in Armenian Studies will join their senior colleagues at UCLA on the weekend of November 13-14 to participate in the Dikranagerd/Diarbekir and Edessa/Urfa conference. This sixth international symposium on Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces will take place, Saturday, November 13, 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and Sunday, November 14, 1:30-6:00 p.m. The conference organizer is Richard Hovannisian, A.E.F. Chair holder in Armenian History at UCLA. First-time participants in the series include three scholars from Paris. On November 13, Claire Mouradian, a historian who has written several volumes on Soviet Armenia and the Caucasus, will present a new file of documents based on the correspondence of the French consul at Dikranagerd/Diarbekir in 1895 and demonstrating in organized nature of the Armenian persecutions.

"As I See It - Armenian Assassinations Tragic, But Need Not Deter Democracy The tragic killings of Armenia's leading political figures by a handful of delusional men have posed yet another challenge to the struggling landlocked country of 3.5 million people located in the southern Caucasus region. This senseless tragedy, very personal to me since I knew the victims, is an aberration in Armenian history. Armenia was the first country to adopt Christianity as its state religion in 301 A.D. Throughout the centuries, Armenians have had an unparalleled history of truth and dedication to their culture and ancestral homeland. Different occupation forces have passed through the area, but Armenians have stayed united. Systematic pogroms at the hands of the Ottoman Turks culminated in the Genocide of 1915 where half the Armenian population, some 1.5 million, perished, and the remainder dispersed all over the world. Because of 17 centuries of Christian tradition, Armenians have a major presence in Jerusalem. One quarter of the Old City is designated as the Armenian Quarter. For centuries, the Armenian Church has assumed the responsibility of maintaining Christianity's holiest sites and making them available to all of mankind. The Manger, the Holy Sepulcher, the Garden of Gethsemane, the Mount of Olives, and Saint James Monastery are but a few examples of holy sites maintained by the Armenian Church. There are roughly four million people of Armenian descent outside of present-day Armenia, approximately one million of whom are in the United States. Armenians throughout the world are known for their contributions to the arts, sciences, politics, business and religion. The best-known institutions, from the Sorbonne to Oxford, Harvard to UCLA, are full of doctors, scientists, engineers, and historians of Armenian descent. Writer William Saroyan, Gov. George Deukmejian, Coach Ara Parseghian, and businessman Kirk Kerkorian are of Armenian descent. On the world stage, singer Charles Anzavour, composer Aram Khachaturian, philanthropist Calouste Gulbenkian, world chess champions Tigran Petrossian and Garry Kasparov, and aeronautical engineer Artern Mikoyan are also of Armenian descent. Armenia savored its first taste of independence in the aftermath of World War I with its 1918 Declaration of Independence. Its two-year experiment in democratic nation-building proved too weak to withstand the looming Soviet expansion, but achieved remarkable precedents: universal suffrage, women and minority representatives selected to parliament, and the appointment of a female ambassador, all in 1918. This new Armenian Republic established a national university and state-funded school system, established the region's first courts and jury trials, sanctioned labor unions, and legalized a new eight-hour work day. Emerging from a collapsing Soviet Union, Armenia adopted a national referendum on independence in 1991 and quickly became a leader in economic market reform as the first former Soviet republic to privatize nearly 90 percent of its agricultural lands by 1992. Armenia continues to outpace economic and political reform among the former Soviet states, despite the hardship of a blockade imposed by neighboring Azerbaijan. The conflict with Azerbaijan is not a religious one between Christians and Muslims. After the 1915 Genocide, Armenians were accepted and cared for by nations such as Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine and Egypt, with mostly Muslim populations. My grandparents and parents were among the lucky ones to survive and were helped by caring people. I grew up with friends of many religions. The present conflict has its genesis with Stalin's dismemberment of what was left of historic Armenia. Azerbaijan succeeded in the ethnic cleansing of all Armenians within its Soviet borders and was ready to cleanse Nagorno-Karabagh, an area of 98 percent Armenian population, when the Armenians fought back by asserting their right of self-determination. Armenians do not have militaristic tendencies in their character and do not have a history of aggression, but when duty has called on them they have responded. During the 1915 Genocide, my grandparents - farmers and businessmen - fought their way to the height of Musa Dagh Mountain (made famous by Franz Werfel's Forty Days of Musa Dagh) rather than be slaughtered, and were lucky to the liberated by the French navy. Armenian volunteers liberated Jerusalem from the Ottoman Turks. Armenian soldiers and officers were in the front lines fighting Hitler's forces. In Karabagh, the options were annihilation or survival, and they had to make a choice. The legacy of this largest tragedy in Armenia reveals the need for a greater emphasis on strengthening the institutions of democracy and solidifying the rule of law. Armenia holds an advantage, however, as the only nation in the region with a legislature strong enough to balance the executive and increasingly independent judiciary, and a recent record of multi-party fairness and transparency. The contrast with its neighbors is marked by their violent and bloody changes of government, their lack of true political dissent and by Armenia's rapid progress in pluralistic and democratic elections. Faced with the challenges of the peace talks over the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict and the necessity to return to normal governance to reassure a weary population, the current situation poses a grave test of responsible leadership. And, the brutal lessons learned throughout Armenia's history, and reiterated in the past days, must not be forgotten by its leaders nor ignored by the international community. This recent tragedy in Armenia, like the devastating earthquake of 1988, is yet another challenge, but not a defeat for Armenian democracy and statehood.

"Helsinki Commission chairman cites repressive policies in Uzbekistan by Chadwich R. Gore WASHINGTON -- Since mid-1992 Uzbekistan has been one of the most repressive new independent states under President Islam Karimov, said Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe Chairman Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) on October 18 at a commission hearing on The State of Democratization and Human Rights in Uzbekistan. There are no registered opposition parties, all media are tightly censored, and there are no independent human rights monitoring organizations, said Rep. Smith. Religious liberty has also been challenged. While for the most part the Jewish community has not encountered difficulties from government bodies, and President Karimov has pursued good relations with Israel, Evangelical Christian denominations have faced official harassment. Moreover, a crackdown on Islamic believers has been under way since 1997. That has been documented in the State Department's Human Rights Report and many reports by non-governmental human rights groups. Uzbekistan is scheduled to hold parliamentary elections in December and a presidential election in January 2000 against this general background, he noted. Commission member Rep. Joseph R. Pitts (R-Pa.) commented, From my travels, I saw that the fear of Islamic extremism is one of the main motivating factors behind the Uzbek government's crackdown on all religious groups ... However, fear does not absolve governments of their responsibilities to protect the rights of citizens to religious liberty ... By prohibiting unregistered religious gatherings and criminalizing free religious speech, Uzbekistan violates its OSCE [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe] commitments to religious liberty and free expression. No democratic state can ever justify what reliable reports tell us about continuing torture, extorted confessions or the planting of false evidence. Even in circumstances where a genuine threat exists to the well-being of the state, rule of law and due process norms must be followed in order to ensure that human rights are protected, he said. Rep. Pitts concluded, The current government policy of violating human rights of Uzbek citizens is an obstacle that must be overcome. Uzbekistan's full potential cannot be realized until these human rights issues are dealt with in a constructive and just way. John Beyrle, deputy to the ambassador-at-large and special advisor to the secretary of state for the new independent states, testified that Uzbekistan has shown little progress in democratization. The U.S. will likely discourage other governments and the OSCE field missions from monitoring the upcoming December and January elections. Free and open media are vital to the growth of true democracy, [yet] Soviet-style press censorship remains pervasive; the rule of law remains weak; and, the exercise of religion is hindered by the 1998 restrictive law on religion, he said. Sodyq Safaev, ambassador of the Republic of Uzbekistan, commented: Uzbeks today face the numerous challenges of building a secular democracy and opposing the threats of religious fundamentalism and political extremism. ... The main achievement of Uzbekistan during the short period of its independence was that it has managed to avoid altogether the disintegration of society, economic collapse and chaos. He continued: 76 percent of the population of Uzbekistan is satisfied with the government's job. ... They see that all institutions of statehood and government are functioning and providing them whatever the state should provide to its citizens. ... The people also see that they have been freed from the shackles of the state economy. ...The people also see that now, at last, for the first time this century, they are genuinely free to travel abroad. ... Both individuals and ethnic groups are free to leave the country, should they so desire. Although Uzbekistan is not fully democratic in the sense that the West understands it, although mistakes have been done, although plenty of shortcomings still exist, it is certainly the freest system under which Uzbeks have ever lived. Ambassador Safaev stated. And [the] nation is firmly committed to the further strengthening of secular democracy and [the] free market. Cassandra Cavanaugh, researcher for Human Rights Watch/Helsinki, presented a very different perspective: By the fall of 1998, ... some have estimated that over 80 percent of all working mosques were closed. We see the following pattern of human rights violations: Arrests are clearly discriminatory, based on evidence of piety such as beard-wearing (now extremely uncommon), regular attendance at suspect mosques or individual prayer or Koranic study alone or in groups. Police often plant evidence which forms the basis for initial charges: small amounts of narcotics, ammunition, or increasingly, banned religious literature, or a combination. The authorities act as hostage-takers, arresting family members or occupying family homes to coerce the appearance of a wanted person. Family members have also been sentenced to prison terms solely on the basis of their affiliation with suspected religious figures. From beginning to end, she continued, the right to a fair hearing is violated, with accused persons most often deprived of the right to counsel, held in incommunicado detention and tortured. There are increasing reports of deaths in detention. Being accused is usually tantamount to being convicted, as the presumption of evidence is entirely lacking. Alarmingly, she noted, The government is building what can only be described as a concentration camp reportedly exclusively for Muslim prisoners at Jaslyk, in the ecological disaster zone of the Ust-Yurt plateau. According to the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, there have been at least 38 deaths in custody in this facility. The U.S. should move beyond talking about the threat of terrorism not justifying repression. ... Recent experience shows that the threat of sanctions can bring about change. ... Therefore, we urge you to make Uzbekistan subject to all measures provided for under the Religious Freedom Act, Ms. Cavanaugh concluded. Paul Goble, communications director, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, noted that Tashkent is converting Islam from a religion to a political force of enormous and potentially destabilizing force. Speaking about the building of two prison camps for political opponents, he noted, These camps will resemble the gulag of the Soviet past, and even if no one is ever confined to them, their existence will cast a chilling shadow over the population. Uzbekistan's most open question is `after Karimov, what?' Mr. Goble said. Lawrence Uzzell, director, Keston Institute, commented, It cannot be stressed too often that Uzbekistan's 1998 law on religion is the most repressive in all of the former Soviet Union. Only in Uzbekistan has the state formally criminalized religious dissent, by formally amending its criminal code to impose prison terms of up to five years for unauthorized religious activity. Unlike Russia, which allows even unregistered groups to gather in the homes of their own members, Uzbekistan explicitly prohibits any kind of communal activity by such a group - even a Bible study in one of its member's apartments. By law, Uzbekistan explicitly bans all forms of missionary activity, bans religious education at the elementary or secondary level, and subjects all imported religious literature to state censorship, he pointed out. Abdurahim Polat, chairman of the Birlik Party and exiled opposition leader, noted Preparations for elections in Uzbekistan are going ahead with full speed, and [in a manner] totally against democratic principles. The opposition is banned from participating in these campaigns. Exiled leaders of democratic opposition decided to delay their return to Uzbekistan. These elections will not have any positive effect on the state of the nation. On the contrary, it may have a negative effect and destabilize the situation. It seems like civil war is unavoidable, he said. With the assistance of the international community, mainly from the member-countries of the OSCE, it is still possible to stop the bloodshed and find the solution in the best interests of the Uzbek nation, Mr. Polat concluded.","Gore, Chadwich R",Ukrainian Weekly,1999-11-07,0
"Armed Forces of Armenia Prove Best Offense Is a Good Defense For the last two weeks, most Armenians have engaged in petty arguments as to who should be the next Catholicos. Some have tried to invoke the ecclesiastical bylaws as a basis for the election of the new church leader, while others have tried to conspire to push the candidacy of their favorite, making others very upset over witnessing the contamination of the Armenian Church with earthly dirty politics. While these arguments continued, many secular-minded Armenians were paying more attention to other serious developments in the region. The first development was the hardening of the Russian position against Chechen separatists and terrorists. After almost a decade of inertia, the Russian government and the military flexed their muscles against militaristic Islamic fighters led by Jordanian-born extremist Khattab and Chechen terrorist Shamil Basayev, who are linked to international terrorist Osama bin Laden, a sworn enemy of the US and Russia. Taking into consideration that Chechen extremists in the past fought against Karabagh Armenians and recently proclaimed that, after expelling Russians from Muslim territories in the Caucasus, they would liberate another occupied Muslim territory, Karabagh, from the infidel Armenians, these recent developments are very important for us. GULUZADE RESIGNS The second most important event was the resignation of Vafa Guluzade, the foreign advisor of the President of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev because of so-called health reasons. This customary excuse for politicians who have fallen from grace in the ex-Soviet countries is usually invoked to make their forced resignation more palatable to both themselves and the public. His departure, like that of his former counterpart Gerard Libaridian two years ago, was forced upon him by the leader of his country due to obvious policy differences. Heydar Aliyev now is cornered and is about to make some serious concessions in the Karabagh dispute, to secure his probable successor, his son Ilham, a stable and governable country free of international disputes and instability. Allegedly Vafa Guluzade, like Libaridian, was serving Western interests rather his country's interests. The experienced Gray Fox Aliyev knows that his army is not a match against the Armenians, third parties will not permit him to launch a war against Karabagh, and any regional armed conflict will set back the oil pipeline projects that he was hoping would bring prosperity to his impoverished country. The third most important development involved the tangible changes in the position of the OSCE Chairmen, particularly the one from the US, who were advising Heydar Aliyev to be more forthcoming in the negotiation process, and to conduct a face-to-face negotiation with Armenians within the framework of the Common State proposals. ADVERSARIES CHANGE TUNE Armenia's adversaries are now ready to sit down and negotiate, thanks to the strength of Armenia's armed forces, which are very impressive, as many participants of the Armenia-Diaspora conference witnessed during the parade on the occasion of the 8th anniversary of Armenia's independence. The message was clear to both friends and foes alike, that this nation's leadership is committed to peace through strength. Indeed, if in the past we had listened to our military men more than to our bishops and archbishops, we wouldn't have been slaughtered like sheep, nor would we have been enslaved for centuries. Those who taught us to be good and love our enemy in order to earn a place in heaven, in fact, deprived us from life on earth. Millions of our brothers and sisters perished long before their time, and Armenia has become a impoverished, ravaged and occupied country due to religious pacifism. Thanks to the Armed Forced of Armenia, today our borders are secure, Armenia's citizens are living free and in peace, and our adversaries are sitting down to negotiate with us seriously. The Armed Forces of Armenia are well disciplined, well trained and equipped with state-of-the-art military hardware, including the latest battle tanks, field artillery, short - and long-range missiles, supersonic jets, and communication gear. They are led by well-educated professional officers. Armenia and Karabagh are the home of many former WWII heroes, generals, marshals, and recent veterans of the Afghanistan and Karabagh wars. When critics based in the Diaspora criticize Armenia's leadership for their shortcomings, they should also learn to praise them for their successes. Forming a glorious armed forces, keeping the Armenian currency stable against foreign currency, creating energy self-sufficiency and even the capacity to export electricity to Georgia, and rebuilding the earthquake-disaster region and war-ravaged Karabagh are not small undertakings. ADVICE TO DIASPORA ARMENIANS Diaspora Armenians should learn to respect Armenia's leaders, forget ambitions, and appreciate the fact that the people of Armenia are the ones who are living on and defending the Armenian lands, not the charlatans of the Diaspora. They should allow the elected leaders to do their job and refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of Armenia. They should learn to put their money where their mouth is. Except for a handful of Diasporan entrepreneurs and benefactors, how many of these Diasporan Armenians have contributed anything to the economy of Armenia? Let them come forth and he counted. How many participants of the Armenia-Diaspora Conference, now that they have returned to their respective countries, will remember the hospitality of the Armenian government and people, the lavish dinner tables and festivities they attended, and return the favor by providing technical and financial assistance? All the good that came out of the Armenia-Diaspora Conference can now be destroyed by all the current mud slinging and false accusations. Thanks to the armed forces and leadership of Armenia, we will continue to maintain the independence of the state, the well-being of its populace, as well as pursuing the Armenian national cause. The truth shall make you free, according to the Bible: Knowing what is true will free you from the bonds of deceit.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-10-30,0
"Gomidas Institute Releases Marsovan 1915: The Diaries Of Bertha Morley, Key New Source on the Armenian Genocide In front of a full house, Gomidas Institute Books released the latest publication in its Armenian Genocide Documentation Series: Marsovan 1915: The Diaries of Bertha Morley. The evening was opened by Ned Apigian (ARF Azadamard Committee). There were three speakers: Ara Sarafian (General Editor of Gomidas Institute Books), Cross Mooradian (on be half of the Mooradian family, which underwrote the publication of the book), and Hilmar Kaiser (who compiled and edited the book). Marsovan 1915 is a critical edition of the diaries of Bertha Morley, an American music teacher in Marsovan (near Kharpert). It is a blow-by-blow account of the Armenian Genocide in Marsovan between April and September 1915. Kaiser noted that the diaries, which were written for Morley's own private purposes, record the systematic disintegration of the Marsovan Armenian community-the arrest of Armenian community intellectuals, the methodical deportation of the rest of the population, and the eventual destruction of deportees. Morley narrates how Armenian property was plundered by Ottoman local and central officials and how Armenian women and children converted and were absorbed into Muslim households. She also testifies to the efforts of Ottoman authorities to conceal their criminal activities. Much of what Morley wrote is familiar to students of the Armenian Genocide. The scenarios she described were also enacted in other parts of the Ottoman Empire at the time. Yet such thematic repetition is of vital significance for the construction of the Armenian Genocide thesis because it demonstrates how deportations, murders, forced abductions, and plunder were systematically carried out under the authority of the Ottomanstate. The diaries of Bertha Morley represent a case study of the Armenian Genocide as recorded by an American music teacher in Marsovan 1915. According to Morley there were no Armenians left to speak of in Marsovan by the end of September 1915. Marsovan 1915: The Diaries of Bertha Morley joins Rev. Henry Riggs's Days of Tragedy in Armenia; Personal Experiences in Harpoot, 1915-1917, and Rev. James Barton's `Turkish Atrocities'; Statements of American Missionaries on the Destruction of Christian Communities in the Ottoman Turkey 1915-1917 in an expanding documentary series on the genocide of Ottoman Armenians.

"Open Letter to Esteemed Patriarch Mesrob Mutafyan I met Your Holiness during a reception at the Sports and Music Complex after the conclusion of the Armenia-Diaspora conference held on September 22-23, 1999 in Yerevan. I informed you of the general consensus of some US delegates from the East Coast that you are considered to be the best person to be nominated for the position of the next Catholicos of All Armenians. I asked you not to be hesitant about accepting such a nomination. Your answer was an affirmative one. As you may agree, the majority of the participants called this conference a success in terms of developing mutual trust, cooperation, and coordination to resolve the enormous social, economic and political issues both Armenia and the Diaspora are facing today. The Government of Armenia did its utmost in collaboration with people from different political, ideological, philosophical and social spectra. They listened earnestly to criticism from the audience and they expressed their willingness in private to take the necessary measures to correct those problems related to corruption, decline in moral values, social injustice, and the brain drain abroad. I believe poet Sylva Gaboudikian's presentation summed up the general feelings of most Armenians when she stated that we cannot allow the degeneration of our social values, disintegration of the social texture of Armenian society, decline of culture, art and science, and seduction of youth with materialism on the pretext of creating a free market economy. To the satisfaction of most delegates, the Armenian leadership absorbed, without anger, harsh public criticism and pointed comments directed at their shortcomings. During the first Armenia-Diaspora conference, between breaks and later during social gatherings, another important upcoming event, the topic of the catholicossal elections, scheduled for October 26-28, was fervently discussed among some concerned delegates, and privately with government officials. To my knowledge, President Robert Kocharian repeatedly pledged that there would be no interference. In his TV and, later, press interview with Hayastani Hanrapetutiun [Republic of Armenia] correspondent Anahid Adamian, on September 23, His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, stated that There is absolutely no interference by the government of Armenia in the upcoming catholicossal election. During the same interview, Catholicos Aram continued, Members of the Armenian government are also the sons and daughters of our nation and they are entitled to express their own opinions and preferences on the catholicossal candidates. Aram I also ruled out any possibility that he would be a candidate, and added that the next Catholicos should be elected from Armenia. Later, the issue of alleged government interference in the upcoming catholicossal election prompted the Armenian Church leaders, from New York to Stepanakert, from Istanbul to Jerusalem, to release a statement, entitled Pastoral Appeal. To my surprise and disappointment, your signature also appeared in the pastoral letter publicly criticizing the Armenian government for interfering to the National Ecclesiastic Assembly election process. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT OF ABP. NERSISSIAN The Armenian government is allegedly supporting the former Catholicossal Vicar, Archbishop Karekin Nersissian, vicar of the Ararat Diocese, to become the next Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians. In all honesty, how can you criticize the Government of Armenia for interference, when your own election needed approval of your country's (Turkey's) government? Without Ankara's consent you could have never been elected Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and All Turkey. Let's not forget about the farce that the Turkish Government displayed first against your nomination; it was a clever ploy by the Turks to give the impression to foreigners that, despite their objections, Armenians elected a Patriarch of their own choice, thanks to the prevailing religious tolerance in Turkey. We both know well that, without the approval of the Turkish government, you could never have been elected. Isn't it also true that any candidate for the post of Patriarch has to be a Turkish citizen, to have served in the Turkish military, and pass the scrutiny of the Turkish Security and Interior Ministry (MIT) for national security reasons? In the same con text, why are you so upset then with alleged Armenian government intervention? Do they have fewer national security concerns then the Turks? Do you realize that you already lost the confidence of the government in Yerevan when you imprudently released the contents of your confidential conversation with the Armenian government representatives to the public? From this point on, the Armenian Government will consider you a national security risk, particularly when there are rumors that foreign governments in the West, including the government of Turkey, would prefer that you or someone from one of the Western countries occupy the throne of St. Gregory the Illuminator. After all, you know well that global politics and religion unfortunately mix only for geopolitical gains. Our nation many times has been subjected to this game, from the time of the Romans, Persians, Byzantines, Ottomans, Czars, and Soviets; the situation is not any different now, is it? Do you believe that, as a Turkish citizen, if you were ever elected to the post of Catholicos, you would be put politically in a compromising situation as a Supreme Patriarch of All Armenians to ask the world to recognize the Armenian Genocide? Immediately, the Turks will make an issue over another Armenian born and educated in Turkey, once again betraying the Turkish fatherland, as other traitors like Krikor Zohrab, Vartges (Hovhannes Serenguilian), and Karekin Pastermadjian did to their Ottoman fatherland. CONFRONTATION WITH ARMENIAN GOVERNMENT In your recent interview, you stated, The Church and State should not be engaged in a conflict. Yet you are taking an active role in spearheading a confrontation with the Yerevan government and taking sides with those irresponsible bishops and archbishops who are openly declaring a war, by threatening not to recognize the next Catholicos, if this person is the former Catholicossal Vicar, Archbishop Karekin Nersissian. Are those bishops and archbishops losing their minds, are they followers of Christianity or of dirty secular dirty politics? Are you encouraging these kinds of irresponsible acts for personal gain in order to become the next Catholicos? If you ever tried this in Turkey, certainly the Turkish government would have more than enough reason to tighten further the already tight rules and regulations, as they did to the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, going back to 1956. Your Beatitude, with all due respect, you must be aware that, in this upcoming catholicossal election, certain circles are using the issue of character and fitness for high office as a pretext to cover up their own personal ambitions, to knowingly or unknowingly serve foreign governments, and for political reasons. Their cry is not for principles, as they pretend, and you are allowing yourself to be used by these circles. If character assassination is a real issue, the Armenian Church hierarchy will have difficulty passing scrutiny not only in Armenia but in the Diaspora as well. JUDGING OTHERS FOR SHORTCOMINGS One might expect that a religious leader of your caliber should criticize all that is considered to be unworthy of the ecclesiastical level, not only the ones running for the highest office. I believe your predecessor, Patriarch Karekin Kazanjian, died because of cirrhosis of the liver inflicted by excessive alcohol use, not expected from a person holding the office of the Patriarch of Istanbul; you served under him without reservation, yet you are judging others for their shortcomings. I believe the cosponsors of this pastoral letter were all subjects of character assassination. Similarly, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Torkom Manoogian once was the subject of insinuations for alleged sexually inverted activities; Archbishop Diran Kureghian, the Primate of Russia, was allegedly a former KGB collaborator; Abp. Khajag Barsamian's quick ascendancy to high position was allegedly attributed to his association with Abp. Torkom Manoogian. Naturally Abp. Nerses Bozabalian, Locum Tenes of the Catholicossate, wants to be the next Catholicos, and he also allegedly collaborated with the KGB. Not to mention many North American Armenians, so-called Etchmiadznagans, when they had excellent working relations with those KGB-elected senior clergy in Soviet Armenia who are now having difficulty establishing working relationships with the elected leaders of free Armenia, and are engaged in name calling. Your Beatitude, it is the easiest thing to let good people's names be smeared in a witch hunt, but the question is, what are we accomplishing by attacking a benevolent person like Louise Simone, a lady who is helping Armenia in every way she can. Banal attacks on Louise Simone are most deplorable, her contribution to Armenia's cultural life, medical facilities, religious institutions, along with those of Kirk Kerkorian, the Hovnanian brothers and Vatche Manoukian, should be most appreciated. Following the conclusion of the successful Armenia-Diaspora conference and on the eve of serious negotiations in the Karabagh conflict, some external forces are trying to create a confrontation between the Diaspora and Armenia, and these forces are using you as an instrument in their divisive tactics. For skeptics, the election of a patriarch, a Turkish citizen, to the position of Catholicos of All Armenians in Holy Etchmiadzin could be considered a ploy to bring Armenia and Turkey into close cooperation, which may bury the thorny Armenian Genocide issue, and change the regional geopolitics in favor of the US. This may not be a far-fetched assumption in the world of political cynicism. The weakening of the Armenian Church and the creation of a division among its ranks will well serve the interests of our adversaries. It is time to stop this madness. I believe Your Beatitude will better serve the Armenian Church and the Armenian national cause, if you gracefully withdraw your candidacy and remain in Istanbul to serve your country, Turkey. Most Armenians believe the election date for the next Catholicos should be postponed to a later date and each candidate's past and present conduct be scrutinized by the nominating committee. For national security reasons, like any other civilized country of the world, the Armenian government should have the right to object to those candidates who may pose a security risk. Assertions that there are more Armenians living in the Diaspora than Armenia, or that there are more resources in the Diaspora churches than in Armenia, or that the senior clergy in the Diaspora are more educated then their counterparts in Armenia, are insufficient arguments to push the candidacy of a Diaspora-based clergyman. IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER The character, moral values, and leadership qualities of the future Catholicos, as with every clergyman from the top to bottom, is vitally important. We all know that there have been many cases in the past of high-ranking clergymen of the Armenian Church with past histories of alcoholism and/or sexual misconduct, including heterosexual affairs as well as homosexual ones, collaboration with foreign services, or embezzlement of church funds. Certainly one can see many similar instances in other denominations or religions, including followers of the Christian, Jewish or Muslim faiths. It is the human factor with none of us being perfect. Yet people expect prudent conduct at the ecclesiastical level. In our time, we have witnessed, particularly in the US, impeachment and humiliation, or even resignation, of the President, arrest and persecution of persons misusing religion for financial or sexual gains. Whether in the US or Armenia, public figures are under scrutiny, and candidates have to learn to deal with it. For the sake of public trust, the Church and Government should deal promptly with those allegations of misconduct and, depending on the outcome, candidates with personal problems or associations with foreign security services should withdraw, to prevent an embarrassment, and any potential damage to the institution. We cannot all be blamed for the administrative division between Etchmiadzin and Cilicia but all of us can be blamed for not coming forth to address issues that could impair the integrity of our Holy See.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-10-16,0
"Orientale Lumen Conference advances ecumenism by Roma M. Hayda Roma M. Hayda is active in the lay and catechetical movements of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. She was a two-term president of the Patriarchal Society in the United States and currently heads this organization's Laity Council. The Orientale Lumen III Conference, held at Catholic University in Washington on June 15-18, was dedicated to the topic Mary, the Mother of God, and the Church. This conference, the third in a series of annual conferences, provided an opportunity for Catholic and Orthodox Christians to discuss their respective traditions regarding the Theotokos (Mother of God). Presentations were given by well-known scholars and theologians, such as Archimandrite Robert Taft, S.J., and the Rev. Michael Fahey, S.J.: liturgical celebrations of many kinds were held; and there were many opportunities for everyone to learn from each other and share in an atmosphere open to dialogue. The speakers represented the Roman Catholic, Ukrainian Orthodox, Russian Greek-Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Assyrian Churches. Among the conference participants were Eastern Catholics who share the Byzantine tradition (Melkites, Rumanians, Russians, Ukrainians and others), representatives of the Eastern Catholic Maronite and Malabar communities, and Coptic Christians. All told, the participants were about equally divided into three categories: Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholics and Roman Catholics. Despite the diversity of faiths represented, there was a convergence of thought that Marian theology is Christ-centered. This understanding is rooted in the Sacred Scriptures and the traditions of the East and West, even though these traditions developed along different paths. Ignoring Mary and raising her to a goddess-like status are two opposing and extreme interpretations of Mary's role that developed in the latter half of the second millennium. However, Christian theology does not support either of these extremes. For many years, the differences between Orthodox and Catholic traditions have been in the process of being overcome, nonetheless, the issue remains of the dogmatic definition of some Marian beliefs by the Roman Catholic Church, definitions that pose a problem for Christian Churches of some Eastern traditions. In particular, the Immaculate Conception of Mary and what the East calls Mary's Dormition (Uspinnia) and the West calls Mary's Assumption into heaven were treated extensively by theologians on both sides of the East-West divide. At the core of the divergent understanding between East and West of the Immaculate Conception is the Augustinian understanding of original sin, which Eastern theology treats differently than does the Roman Catholic Church. However, theologians of different traditions agree that Mary also needed redemption and that her major contribution was her intelligent and voluntary decision to be the Bohorodytsia, the Mother of God, in the span of her earthly life and beyond. Theologians noted continually that at every moment of her life Mary was dependent on the Logos, her divine Son. Related closely to the Augustinian notion of original sin is Mary's Assumption. The Rev. Fahey, who frequently is consulted by official Catholic-Orthodox ecumenists, said the Eastern Churches resent what they perceive to be the oversimplification in proclamation of some Roman Catholic dogmas. Narrowing down the mystery surrounding the Bohorodytsia easily leads to extremes and circumvents the East's transcendent view of Mary, the Theotokos - the living icon of divinization. The Rev. Fahey called for appropiate Christological and ecclesiological balance. Throughout the conference, diverse Christian communities participating in this dialogue addressed conflicting areas, as well as the common ground for their beliefs. The Assyrian Church's presentation notably differed from that of other participants. Going back to Apostolic times, this Christian Church is Semitic in character. Its church interiors resemble that of a synagogue and do not have the iconography associated with most Eastern Churches. The Assyrian Church's Bishop Mar Bawai Soro explained that in the early centuries the Assyrian Church did have iconography, and does not object to iconography today, but the tradition was lost during many centuries of isolation amid an overwhelming Muslim majority. Until relatively recently the Assyrian Church did not participate in the ecumenical dialogue. However, the contribution of the Assyrian Church confirms the common Christian theology of the Early Church, even though with distinct spiritual traditions, and it is a strong reminder of the real meaning of the eucharistic union within the community of Churches in the first millennium. The Kyivan Christian tradition was represented by Dr. Roman Yereniuk of the Ukrainian Orthodox St. Andrew's College in Winnipeg. Dr. Yereniuk spoke from the perspective of the Ukrainian religious and cultural ethos. His talk was enhanced with innumerable illustrations of the Bohorodytsia icons with appropriate historical references, as for example the world famous Bohorodytsia of Vyshorod (also known as Our Lady of Vladimir) that is now in the Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow (but will soon be housed in a functioning church). Movement has its disappointments The ecumenical movement that carries so much promise also has its disappointments. Any major directional change has its pitfalls. The political considerations of power players overshadow real achievements of the past and those yet to come. The June meeting in Baltimore of the International Joint Commission for the Theological Dialogue Between the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church was canceled at the last minute due to the bombing in Serbia and the refugee crisis in Kosovo. Pressed by the Orthodox, the Ecumenical Patriarchate and the Holy See issued a joint cancellation communique, another in a series of repeated postponements. The plenary session that should meet every two years has not met since 1993. One would think that in the face of serious problems it is that much more important to continue the discussions. The International Joint Commission, which is the official dialogue group, is exclusionary in character - also a disappointment. For example, during the dialogue when Eastern Catholic Churches were at the center of discussion, the Ukrainian Catholic Church and other Eastern Churches in Union with Rome were not included and, therefore, not present to state their case. This is a frustrating element in view of the Catholic-Orthodox internal division within most Eastern Churches as the Kyivan and Antiochian Churches (among so many others) bear witness. Despite disappointments, meaningful progress has been made. Despite constraints posed to dialogue by the established International Joint Commission, serious unofficial ecumenical dialogue groups make valuable contributions. The Kyivan Church Study Group, established in 1992, has effectively addressed the common roots of Ukrainian Orthodox Churches and what the Rev. Andriy Chirovsky of the Metropolitan Andriy Sheptytsky Institute in Canada defines more accurately as the Ukrainian Greco-Catholic Church. In addition, they addressed theological issues brought to the forefront by the International Joint Commission and by doing so the Ukrainian Catholic Church's position was presented from learned theologians. In the process, the study group continues to define the particularity of the Kyivan Christian Tradition and bring about an increasingly clearer picture of the internally divided Church that endured a painful and complex past. The Kyivan Church Study Group and the Orientale Lumen document itself were the inspirations of the Orientale Lumen annual conferences. Sponsored by the Eastern Churches Journal, the Society of St. John Chrysostom, and the Catholic University's School of Religious Studies, the organizers have the intellectual capacity and genuine dedication to ecumenism to make a difference. Bishop Vsevolod of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. is on the planning committee of the Orientale Lumen conferences. For a decade he has served on the U.S. Catholic-Orthodox dialogue, representing the Standing Committee of Orthodox Bishops in America. Besides theological, liturgical and Scriptural discourse on the Bohorodytsia, there was a clearly expressed desire to invite the ecclesial communities that came out of the Reformation experience to join the discourse. Privately, the question of canonical and noncanonical communities was also discussed. The ability to meet an acceptable level of discussion has been a [legitimate] concern, because scholarship is needed to address issues surrounding each Church entity. Unfortunately the matter of canonical status has been used by some Churches participating in the ecumenical dialogue for political purposes. For example, the Ukrainian Catholic and the Ukrainian Orthodox Churches (and there are several Orthodox jurisdictions) have experienced politically motivated moves by the Moscow Patriarchate. On another note, in the case of the Ukrainian Churches, isolation of the Churches is not the answer. When this was mentioned to the organizers of the Orientale Lumen conferences, the response was that these conferences are not sponsored by any particular jurisdiction - all people of good will who are interested in the program are welcome to attend, and certainly no one would be excluded because of their adherence to any particular Church jurisdiction. If at this time there is no active participation in the ecumenical dialogue of the Ukrainian Churches, then continued demands to be included without providing the commitment are meaningless. The ideal of ecumenism is to come together as a communion of communities (a eucharistic union), while respecting the fullness of diverse traditions. This process re-examines the Roman primacy, papal infallability and the collegiality of bishops of the first Christian millennium. Clearly, the model of the second millennium follows more closely the monarchical model of governance that does not always correspond to the Gospel. Coming from divergent Christian traditions, the convergence of theological thought on Mary was impressive. Christ's centrality in Marian iconography and Mary's portrayal in prayer with her hands raised, as in the famous Oranta icon in the apse of St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv, is also a primary symbol of the Church. This eternal ideal remains always to be reached.","Hayda, Roma",Ukrainian Weekly,1999-09-26,0
"North Caucasian instability Is Nightmare for Russian Federation and Armenia Russia, officially known as the Russian Federation, is made up of Federal Republics, Regions (Oblasts), Autonomous Regions, Territories (Krays), and Autonomous Districts (Okrugs). The Russian Federation covers 6,592,800 square miles in area and has a population of 146,861,000. The inflation rate is 84.4%, death rate per 1000 population is 15.0% and life expectancy is 58.3 years for males, and 71.7 years for females, while the infant mortality rate is 24.7%. Alcoholism is a Russian disease affecting the average man on the street to the Kremlin hierarchy. Corruption is rampant, and nine multi-billionaire tycoons, who have invested most of their earnings in foreign banks abroad, control the national economy. It has been Russia's destiny to be governed by self-serving, corrupt and cunning leaders from the time of the Boyars to the Czars, from the Commissars to the contemporary pseudo-democrats. Russia's foreign debt is ever increasing, the budget deficit is covered by foreign loans, and its economy is faltering. Russia's international prestige is on the decline and Russia is facing a threat from its ethnic elements and Islamic fundamentalists. RUSSIA'S UNDERBELLY EXPOSED In particular, Russia's soft underbelly in the northern Caucasus and Caspian-Volga Basin, as well as Central Asia, is exposed. New ethnic insurgence is threatening the territorial integrity of Russian Federation. Russians compose only 86.6% of the total population; there is a significant number of Turkic ethnicity and Muslims who are living in the other Federal Republics: Altay, Buryatia, Chechnya, Chuvashia, Daghestan, Ingushetiya, Karbardino-Balkaria, Kalmykiya, and Autonomous Districts like Tataristan, etc. So far, Moscow has been confronted with a crisis in Chechnya and now in Daghestan. Probably there are more insurgencies in progress. Dispirited and unpaid Russian recruits and even elite Russian paratroopers are no match against the well-motivated Chechen and Daghestani rebels. The widening conflict increases instability throughout the oil-and gas-rich Caspian Basin and Caucasian regions. The declining Russian power and prestige has already created a power vacuum in the region, and foreign countries, especially Turkey, Iran, and the US, are attempting to influence the regional politics and are contesting with each other over access to the energy riches of the region. President Yeltsin is changing his premier every couple of months. THE CASE OF CHECHNYA The new acting Prime Minister and Prime Minister designee Vladimir V. Putin has staked his credibility on crushing the rebels in Daghestan. His predecessors also have claimed quick victory, but they all failed. Russia still insists that Chechnya is part of the Russian Federation, but it is a fact that Chechnya is de facto an independent country, and Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev is openly challenging Russia's authority in Daghestan. Islamic fundamentalist volunteers from Turkey, Afghanistan, Iran, Azerbaijan and Saudi Arabia are pouring in to conduct holy war against the infidel Russians. The US-supported Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo are forcing the Christian Orthodox Serbs to accept a de facto partition of the Yugoslav Federation. The prospect of direct US support to the Muslims of the Russian Federation is not farfetched; at the very least, a proxy intervention using Turks and Azeris to undermine Russia's authority is highly probable. Where all these conflicts or geopolitical games may lead is hard to predict, but the rising power of Islam may eventually pose a threat against Western civilization and the US. The increasing number of Muslims in the US, and the conversion of American Blacks to the Islam religion is not uncommon. In the past, the Christian States helped the Muslim countries economically, militarily and politically, but it is seldom seen for any Muslim country to help a Christian country, with the exception of Iran's assistance to Armenia, and the Arab countries who helped the Armenian survivors of the Genocide. NEW WORLD DISORDER In this multipolar world, after the demise of the evil empire USSR, the expectations of building a New World Order didn't materialize. Instead, we have witnessed the fragmentation of larger states into new nations, whereby a new world disorder has been created. More fragmentation of the other States, like the Russian Federation, Turkey, People's Republic of China, may occur in the future, depending on the balance of power among the competing national interests. Our primary concern is Armenia's safety and security. With the emergence of Islamic power and the Muslim nuclear nation of Pakistan, coupled with the declining Christian fortunes in the region, unfavorable conditions are being created for the Christian States of Serbia, Greece, Russia, Georgia and Armenia, and even further east to China and India where there is a considerable Islamic population. The declining Christian birth rate and increasing Islamic birth rate is another time bomb, which will threaten regional stability. In the year 2010, the projected population figures for the Islamic countries are: Turkey, 76 million; Azerbaijan, 8.2 million; Turkmenistan, 5.7 million; Uzbekistan 28.7 million; Kazakhstan, 16.1 million; Kyrghyzstan, 5.3 million; Afghanistan, 34 million; Pakistan, 176.4 million; Iran, 73.1 million. These figures are only for the Islamic countries around the vicinity of Armenia. CHRISTIAN POPULATION SMALL Armenia's projected population for the same year is 13.8 million, Georgia's is 5.2 million, Greece's is 10.8 million, Serbia's is 10 million, and Russia's is 143.9 million, provided that the Russian Federation will not have disintegrated by then. The real danger for Armenia comes from the declining birth rate, increased infant death and mortality rate in populace, and increasing emigration abroad. It is no longer a secret that the Chechens have a hostile disposition against the Armenians. The Chechen rebel leader Shamil Basayev was in Nagorno Karabagh during the height of Armenian-Azeri conflict, and Chechen mercenaries, along with Afghan Mujaheddins, were fighting against Armenians. Recently, Chechen leaders again threatened Armenians and swore to liberate the Muslim territory of Nagorno Karabagh. Any Islam fundamentalist successes in the North Caucasus will have everlasting detrimental effects on Armenia. The introduction of NATO and the US military presence into the Caucasus would be helpful for Armenia's security and even for Russia's security, since Islamic fundamentalism is a real threat to the US and Western civilization as well. Although the introduction of religion into politics and geopolitics is a bad choice, it is a case under study for strategic thinkers. The war between the Islamic Crescent and the Christian Cross may be viewed by skeptics as an outdated concept but today's realities prove that it is not farfetched either. In the case of the Armenians, we cannot take a chance at all; it is a matter of survival.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-09-18,0
"Inter-Faith Group under the Banner of Appeal of Conscience Foundation Expresses Solidarity in Extending Humanitarian Aid to the Victims of Earthquake in Turkey A delegation of leaders representing diverse religious backgrounds came together here at the State Department to meet with the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright. The Honorable Secretary was a gracious host and listened attentively to the reports of action taken by each organization, church, mosque and synagogue represented there. Speaking on behalf of the group, Rabbi Athur Schneier, President, Appeal of Conscience Foundation, said: Madam Secretary, my colleagues and I represent a broad spectrum of America's religious faith; we want to thank you and the President for your leadership in responding to the earthquake disaster which has traumatized the people of Turkey. Many of the relief organizations connected with our communities also responded to this enormous disaster, reminding us once again of the vulnerability of human life. Lives can be shattered and snuffed out suddenly; tragedy gives no warning and takes no vacation. This is why we appeal to our fellow Americans of faith and heart to devote today, Saturday and Sunday to prayer and humanitarian action in the mosques, synagogues and churches, as a sign of solidarity with the people of Turkey. During our meeting with the Turkish Ambassador Baki Ilkin this morning, we learned more fully of the devastation and the enormity of the tasks ahead: to bury loved ones, care for the homeless and begin the long process of reconstruction. They need help from the American public and private sector. We are confident that the United States will play a major role in the long-term international relief effort which now matches the magnitude of the vast destructions equally powerful message of support and encouragement to the people of Turkey. The American people are known for their spirit of generosity. We will do our share in support of an afflicted part of humanity - the Turkish people. Among the groups represented were: The National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States of America represented by Rev. Dr. Rodney I. Page, Deputy General Secretary; Rev. M. William P. Fay, Assoc. Gen. Secretary, National-Conference of Catholic Bishops; His Grace Bishop George Papaioannou, Archiepiscopal Vicar, Greek Orthodox, Archdiocese; Imam Yusef Safeem, Muslim American Society; Ms. Diana Aviv, United Jewish Communities, Washington, DC; H.E. Most Rev. Archbishop Herman, Abp. of Philadelphia and Eastern Pennsylvania, O.C.A. and Rev. Fr. Vertanes Kalayjian, Pastor, St. Mary Armenian Apostolic Church, Washington, DC, representing the Primate of the Diocese. The Inter-Faith group earlier had met the Ambassador of Turkey, H.E. Baki Ilkin and were briefed on the extent of the destruction and human suffering. He was pleased to announce that the humanitarian aid offered by Armenia was on its way the very morning. The same issue was again highlighted as the group met with Mr. Marc Grossman, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, prior to meeting with the Hon. Madeleine Albright. Among concerns expressed were also the status of both the Greek Orthodox seminary and that of the Armenian Patriarchate. The wisdom of close cooperation with the local nongovernmental organizations actively operating in the earthquake area was also stressed. Rev. Fr. Vertanese Kalajian reported, among other representatives, the humanitarian actions taken and the appeals made by both His Beatitude Mesrob II, and the Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church H.E. Archbishop K. Barsamian. In response to this historic meeting, The Honorable Secretary of State issued the following statement: I had the privilege today of meeting with a very distinguished group of religious leaders concerning the urgent and ongoing need to support earthquake recovery efforts in Turkey. The leaders - Rabbi Schneier, Reverend Page, Monsignor Fay, Bishop George, Iman Yusef, Archbishop Hennan, Father Kalayjian and Mrs. Aviv - reflect the breadth of America's commitment to this effort, particularly within faith-based communities. I want to extend my full support to their call for action. From the day the quake occurred, the United States has joined a broad range of other countries in providing material assistance to the rescue, relief and recovery work in the devastated regions of Turkey. Both President Clinton and I called Turkish leaders to express our sadness and shock and to offer help. There is much our government can do. But the need for assistance, both now and in the months ahead, will far outstrip the amount we or others can provide through official channels. That is why the contributions of nongovernmental organizations are so critical. President Clinton has called on Americans to give generously to responsible charitable groups that are supporting relief efforts. The distinguished leaders I have met with today are effectively conveying the same message to citizens around our country. As always, our people are responding generously and I am confident they will continue to do so. It is vital to remember that the recovery and rebuilding process in Turkey will go on long after the tragedy itself has faded from the headlines. Our commitment to assist, both as a government and as a people, must be long term. Turkey is our ally and friend. Its people are in desperate need. We cannot - and I know we will not - let them down. The Inter-Faith group expressed willingness to support the Administration's effort to request additional appropriations from the Congress. In view of the expected visit of the Prime Minister of Turkey Hon. Bulent Ecevit, there was an expressed hope to meet him as well. There was a brief press conference where a few of the issues were highlighted and further explanations were offered. During the photo-op, our own Miss Joyce Naltchayan was among the photojournalists representing Agence France Presse.

"Informing the Misinformed About Religion and Politics Whether one likes it or not, politics and religion often interconnect, and these two structures are conterminous. Both institutions are an integral part of mankind's social life and their coexistence is commonly seen, from the most primitive societies to the most advanced ones. Religion has an integral place in American political culture as well. During election year, it is not uncommon to see the incumbent President and First Lady or presidential candidate and his wife sit up front in their customary pew during church services under the TV cameras, or visit other denominations' places of worship, including synagogues. In turn, American voters look at what values motivate their political leaders and what their core beliefs are. One may argue and defend that the secular state structure is more idealistic and functional than the ecclesiastical state system, yet politics in both forms are only relatively modified; they both have internal and external dynamics, and their main desires are for the preservation of power, or social values and order. CONTRADICTIONS ABOUND While the secular state tries to implement constitutional law, the ecclesiastical state apparatus prefers to apply institutions, invoking divine authority, may develop ideas and tools which contradict secular claims and values. In order to exercise their influence and power, secular institutions react against these challenges in order to preserve the authority of the state. This kind of confrontation between two structures can be seen during social and political changes. Depending on educational, social and/or economic level, and the tradition of the populace, either showdown or coexistence between ecclesiastical and political power centers may ensue. One can witness this kind of contest in Turkey, between the ruling elite, Turkish Generals, and devoted Islamic populace, or in Iran between the ruling Mullahs and discontented masses. In Soviet Armenia too, the Communist regime and Church coexisted since political realities forced both sides to cooperate. Religious institutions and politicians, although in different ways, are equally involved with economic, social, civic and communal issues yet they may have diverse interests and perspectives; cooperation or collision may ensue, depending on their goals and objectives. The interconnection between religion and politics can be seen in civil rights, gay rights, abortion rights, rights to display religious symbols in public places, etc., and all these issues become the subject of political campaigns with the injection of religious or moral tones into the program. The integration of political agendas and religion can be seen in early Judaism and Armenian Christianity, when under foreign invasion or domination these two distinct nations tried to preserve their ethnic identity or political entity and structure by forming a religious community within a new state structure established by occupying forces. INTERCONNECTION OF RELIGIOUS & POLITICS The entire Old Testament attests to the political struggle of the Is realties against foreign or local tyrants. The saga of the exodus of the Hebrews from Egypt under Moses is a perfect example of political involvement of religious institutions. Under the yoke of the Roman Empire, followers of Judaism in occupied Israel were exuberant when they thought that Jeshua (Jesus Christ) was the promised Messiah who would deliver the Israelis from the yoke of the Gentiles (Romans). When the Israelis realized that Jesus was promising them the Kingdom of Heaven but not the liberation of Israel, and He was preaching to them to love their enemy and turn the other cheek, the people of Israel preferred to follow convicted Barnabas, in order to terminate the Roman occupation. The Armenian rebellion under Vardan Mamikonian against Persian rule with the participation of clergy, notably Ghevond Vartabed, was a manifestation of the will of the people to preserve the political independence of Armenia. In this case, political and religious structures were closely aligned to defeat the common enemy. The ideals of divine and political liberty merged for the good of the fatherland in the Battle of Vartanantz. The evolution of the Armenian Church under Persian, Byzantine, Arab and Ottoman occupation was a historical necessity. As the residence of the Catholicate of All Armenians kept changing its location, political requirements placed new challenges at every level of ecclesiastical institutions, and the Armenian Church was turning to a national bastion to preserve Armenian identity. The Armenian Church has become a spiritual and political organizational force. For example, Patriarch Mkrtich Khrimian Hairik and his associates pursued the political rights of the Armenian nation at the Conference of Berlin. Patriarch Malachia Ormanian become the figurehead leader of stateless Armenians. COLLUSION EVER PRESENT Collussion between politics and religion is seen from ancient times down to the present. The very nature of the Crusades during medieval times, with the pretext of delivering Christian shrines in the city of Jerusalem from Muslim occupation, in fact was based on economic and political considerations. As a matter of fact, the Crusaders were after the riches of the East when they arrived in Constantinople; they robbed and ransacked city's riches, creating contempt among the Greek Orthodox population. When the Crusaders arrived at the Cilician Gate, instead of helping their fellow Christian Armenians, they tried to project the power of the papacy advocating conversation to Catholicism in order to enhance the Latin power, domain and influence. This is another perfect example of religious institutions meddling into global politics. The humiliation of King Henry IV of Germany to walk barefoot to Rome to apologize to Pope Gregory VII for challenging the Pope's authority is also a manifestation of collusion between religion and politics. The collaboration of Pope Pius XII with Nazi Germany and his appeasement of Germany's fascist leaders were also based on the political expediency of religious institutions. The alleged assassination of Pope John Paul I and Catholicos Zareh is also part of internal politics of religious institutions. The election of Pope John Paul II to the papacy at the height of the Solidarity Labor movement in Poland, the prelude to the collapse of Communism, is another manifestation of the collusion between religious institutions and political centers in global dimensions. Not to mention the KGB's interference in the internal and external affairs of Etchmiadzin during Soviet rule in Armenia, or the alleged CIA involvement in Cilician church affairs during the Cold War period. Fairly recently, former President of Armenia, Levon Ter-Petrossian's interference in favor of the late Catholicos Karekin II's election. In the US, the role of the so-called Christian Coalition or Christian Right in election politics is well known. Southern Baptists, United Methodists, Irish Catholics, Orthodox Jews, even Hindus and Buddhists with their political agendas are still mixing politics with religion. In conclusion, mixing politic with religion is not my idea; it is part of human culture from ancient times until today. I am not an advocate of it but I am trying to be analytical and factual. A WORD TO CRITICS This space is too limited to go into detail about how religion and politics mix, which is a fact of life. Those who loudly criticize mixing politics with religion are the ones who failed the Armenian Church until now. Playing politics in parish council elections, not inviting so-called rival church hierarchy to commemorative or ecumenical events, as we witnessed after the death of Karekin II. The list goes on and on. It pays to be well informed and to be a good student of history and social studies. It also helps to be sincere, realistic and factual. Self-deception helps no one. It is different to be a realist and factual, or to be a hypocrite and deceptive. Yes, it would be ideal to separate church and state but, as long as politicians love to play religion, and clerics become involved in politics, a clear delineation of the their responsibilities and duties will be hard to define. Therefore, wouldn't it be better to choose one that plays both politics and religion better than the pretenders? Yes, the elected Armenian leaders of Armenia and Karabagh will lead the people of Armenia and Karabagh to a new millennium, and the elected spiritual leader of Etchmiadzin will lead those Armenians throughout world who want to be lead. His Grace Archbishop Barkev Mardirosian might be my choice for his realistic approach to today's needs. It is true that there are few Armenians left in both Armenia and the Diaspora who discriminate against Karabagh Armenians, as they were discriminating against the late Karekin II. It is also sad an true that some people of Armenia would also continue to discriminate against foreign-born Armenians, as some in the Diaspora continue to discriminate against Armenians from Armenia and Karabagh. After al, politics and religion have interacted throughout the centuries and continue to be coterminous even today. Those ho are not happy with it must first stop mixing politics with religion themselves.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-09-11,0
"Armenia and Karabagh in the New World Order - Part II LEANING TOWARD TOTAL DOMINATION The once respected and admired democratic United States has the opportunity and tendency of becoming a dictator all over the world. There is no power in the world to restrain its unlimited voracious appetite, guided only by economic self-interest. Wherever in the world its hard-line policy is resisted, the US enforces its selfish policy over the rest of the world's nations by using unlimited power against unruly nations. It exercises several severe punishing means, such as restrain them, it uses the military forces of the United Nations and NATO. If there is a strong objection by the member nations to use these forces, the US uses its own, along with those of its devoted partner, England, with complete disregard for the United Nations resolutions, or world opinion on these matters. Unfortunately, this is the result of an imbalance of power in the world. The balance of world power has restrained the US and the Soviet Union from reckless adventures. The US lost the Vietnam War and the Soviet Union lost the Afghan war. These are two examples of the good from the balance of power. One may wonder if the adventures in Iraq, Panama, Bosnia, and Kosovo would have taken place if there had been a balance of world powers. The US involvement in Iraq had two main purposes: one, establishing long desired military bases in the Middle East by using false scare tactics under the pretext that Iraq is about to attack Saudi Arabia; and secondly, to make Saddam Hussein an example of what to expect if a nation's ruler does not obey the New world Order. Another similar example was Panama's Noriega, to teach the Latin American countries a lesson for their disobedience. Disregarding international law and world opinion, the US invaded a sovereign country, kidnapped its president and replaced him with a US-trained puppet. Kosovo was an ethnic tragedy inflamed and expanded by NATO aerial attacks. Why Kosovo? Why not Turkish Kurdistan, where Turks have destroyed over 3,000 Kurdish villages, dispersed their population, and continue the assassination of Kurdish intellectuals, forbidding the Kurds to enjoy their language and culture? Why not Rwanda, site of the first African genocide? BLACK SHEEP OF EUROPE There is an obvious reason. The Serbians and Bulgarians are the black sheep of the European community. They, like the Russians, are of Slavic origin and religiously are close to the Russian orthodoxy. Perhaps for that reason the Serbians and Bulgarians are considered pro-Russian and, therefore, are unwelcome neighbors to the European community. The Serbs and Bulgarians have been grateful to the Russian people, for assisting them in their struggle to free themselves from centuries of Turkish subjugation, freedom which has never sat well with Turkey. The Serbs were one of the strongest opposing forces in Europe against the Nazis during World War II, and caused considerable casualties to the Nazi army, which the Germans will never forget or forgive. Branded as pro-Russian, the Serbs and Bulgarians became an outcast to the Western world. Therefore, they are not trusted for future NATO membership and are not subordinates of the New World Order. This is why the United came a convenient target for the United States, England, Germany and Turkey to strike when the ethnic dispute in Kosovo heated up. The Allies knew that by bombing Serbia they would further irritate and subsequently detonate the explosive ethnic conflict between the Serbs and the local Muslims. They got what they had hoped and planned for. With their aggressive action against the Serbs, they aim to prove to the Muslim world that the Western powers are not anti-Muslim after all. By striking the Serbs, they also knowingly to defend their partner in time of need. The US-NATO bombing of Serbia has long surpassed the barbarism of Milosevic. Destroying Serbia and its economy, killing the Serbian people and occasionally killing the Kosovo Albanians, whom they supposedly are protecting, is this done just to punish Milosevic? Does Washington really care about the Kosovo Albanians? What's the real reason for US involvement? Control of the region, establishing a military base for another NATO adventure? Regardless of the outcome of the Kosovo adventure aimed against tiny Serbia, NATO lost its prestige and credibility as defender of democracy, becoming nothing but a colonial force in the hands of the superpowers. It has become a routine necessity for the US to test its advances weapons of mass destruction and military personnel on real targets and humans: Panama, Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan and now Kosovo. One may wonder which country is the next victim - Iran? Libya? Syria? or perhaps Armenia? Karabagh? On the road to speedy democracy, economically decayed Russia was degraded and treated as a third-world country by the New Superpowers in spite of the vast unclear power the Russians still possess. RUSSIAN FACTOR VOLATILE The Super Powers seem to ignore the possible dangerous reality Russia may face after the term of their trusted man, Yeltsin, expires. The ruined Russian people, out of desperation and anxiety, may have to choose a dictator as their nation's leader, a savior from the present economic chaos and lawlessness. Hoping that he will change the presently downgraded image of Mother Russia from a subordinate of the World Super Powers into, if not respected, but at least a feared world power. Surrounded by non-hostile NATO forces, Russia cannot any more ignore its national security interests. Russia has no other choice but to reconstruct its military power, increase its defense production and regain its number-two status of armament sales which will considerably revitalize the Russian economy, just like it does for many countries. To successfully implement the New World Order throughout the world, the United States is engaged in sponsoring worldwide educational seminars by bringing in young graduates of various fields of science and business, etc. from all over the world, training these future governmental leaders, leading scientists, and businessmen by guiding them in the direction of accepting the policy of the New World Order as the one and only best policy for the entire world. Thousands and thousands of these youngsters enter the United States each year from all over the world, including several hundred from Armenia. The United States in hoping that the new core of loyalists in these nations will secure its dominance of the world. Through these people, the US intends to increase and strengthen its intelligence surveillance throughout the world. The United States, through Michael Lemmon, its ambassador to Armenia, suggests that Armenia will prosper under the New World Order if it establishes closer ties with neighboring countries Turkey and Azerbaijan. America, he said, has a strong interest in opening a commercial route linking Azerbaijan to Turkey via Armenia which would bring very, very real economic benefits. This is nothing but a threat that Armenia can prosper economically only if Karabagh and the people of Karabagh are sacrificed by being handed over to the bloodthirsty Azeris, just to ensure America's economic gain in the Caucasus. On the one hand, the world financial powers provide generous humanitarian loans to Armenia while, on the other hand, they allow the Azeris and Turkey to unlawfully blockade Armenia, making it difficult, if not impossible, for Armenia to pay back its debt. Thus, human suffering is increasing in this tiny nation. Pope John Paul II is helplessly witnessing the performance of the New World Order, the economic globalization, the free market and financial control, resulting in indebted and bankrupted countries. In his message called Respect for Human Rights and the Secret of True Peace, he expressed his deep concern of growing inhumane and unbearable conditions created under the New World Order. In the meantime, the poor countries, among them Armenia, are becoming poorer, facing the unjust treatment from the world superpowers. One may wonder, what is the future of the New World Order since it is already facing a worldwide financial crisis even though the US is flourishing economically? The United States, continuing its behavior in the world arena, may force the international community to create a counter-power. The only way the world can be saved from tyranny is to restore the balance of power. The concentration of world power in the hands of the nation undermines the spirit of democracy among nations, large or small. No country has a legal or moral right to act or their own in the name of the United Nations. Nations cannot be called democratic if they are controlled by a single party. Similarly, the world cannot be democratic if only one nation controls its destiny.","Safarian, Sargis S",Armenian Reporter International,1999-08-21,0
"If He Builds It, They Will Come In the fall of 1959, as the air outside turned cooler than he was accustomed to, Kevork Hovnanian sat by himself in a battered old trailer on a half-cleared lot on Toms River, waiting for customers and imagining the empty land all around him filled with new houses. His construction company was new, formed with his three younger brothers after his arrival in America from Iraq the previous January, but his plan for the site was ambitious, calling for 110 homes. If he sold a dozen a year, he calculated, he would earn a decent living for almost a decade. Rising from the raw earth beside his cramped trailer-turned-office was the first and only model of Holiday Estates, a three-bedroom, split-level of a style that, while completely unfamiliar in his native Baghdad, was sprouting all over the green spaces of a state in the midst of a demographic revolution. Two Levels Full of Luxurious Living, the ads promised for just $11,990 with only $390 down. Never has such a big, quality constructed home been offered at this amazing low price. Hovnanian had commissioned no market studies, convened no focus groups, consulted no housing surveys, but instead had just looked at the Garden State Parkway - the escape route from the north that had opened a few years earlier - and at the exit ramps that spilled out into nothing but trees and fields. Other builders had made the same observation and were busy putting up frames that he counted each day. The homes they built... looked very cheap, Hovnanian recalls, the prices corresponded - two or three thousand dollars less than he hoped to get. I thought we should build something better. The twelve houses representing his sales goal for the first year sold in the first month, and at each closing he presented the new owner with a bottle of champagne. His company added new models - a ranch, an English Tudor, a four bedroom - and within a year was scouting for more open land along other southbound highways. The cramped urban masses of northern New Jersey and New York City had made a choice, trading time for space, getting in their cars and driving father from their jobs, and fleeing the old neighborhoods for quarter-acre Edens in the virgin suburbs, And the Hovnanians were ready for them. White tens of thousands of New Jersey residents may be grateful for the opportunity to own their own homes - what single achievement better embodies the American dream, after all? - Hovnanian has his critics. They claim that K. Hovnanian projects (in the sixties the brothers split into four companies, of which Kevork's is the largest) have only homogenized suburban homes and contributed mightily to the festering dilemma of suburban sprawl. But the criticism has barely dented the steamrolling success of K. Hovnanian in every corner of New Jersey, where no one builds more homes. These days, the Hovnanian name stands at the very symbol of the state's homebuilding boom of the past 40 years. It is not unusual to see eager buyers camp out like rock fans in search of concert tickets whenever K. Hovnanian debuts a new townhouse development. Despite, the admitted absence of a long-range business plan, the company managed to stay one step ahead of ever more prosperous baby boomers, providing them with condominiums, detached houses, and, when they're ready, retirement communities. In recent years, the company sold its first million-dollar home, crowning Hovnanian's role as the builder who more than any other has dramatically reshaped New Jersey's landscape. I'm interested in growth, says Hovnanian, who took the company public in 1983 and now serves as chairman, not in how much money I have in the bank. He's never named a town after himself, as his business inspiration William Levitt did, and he never built any one community on the scale of the original Levittown, where 17,311 carbon-copy cottages were set down like Monopoly houses in the potato fields of Long Island. In his Middletown office, with the wide-angle view across the shimmering Navesink River into Red Bank, Kevork Hovnanian keeps no map to track the trail of his company's huge footprints. But if you add up all of the homes that he has built in the last 40 years - 62,000 in all, 40,000 of them in New Jersey -you get a city of sorts, as dispersed and diverse as the state itself, encompassing blackjack dealers in condos that peek through the pines outside Atlantic City, retired teachers in the gated senior havens of Ocean County, and stockbrokers with their three-car garages practically within hailing distance of Wall Street. About 120,000 New Jerseyans live in what could be called HovCity, or roughly 1.5 percent of the state's population. Is it? Hovnanian asks when he hears the figures. You are telling me something I never thought of - I really honestly never thought of it. Kevork Hovnanian first came to America in 1956 to shop for new stone-crushing equipment for his road-building company in Baghdad. To see one of the machines in operation, he visited Levittown, New Jersey (now called Willingboro), where he was even more impressed by the assembly -line efficiency with which houses were being put together. Excited by visions of subdivisions rising in the desert back home, he asked to see the man in charge and invited the innovative American to expand to Iraq. He was disappointed when a Levitt official explained to him that the Jewish firm would not be welcome in an Arab country. Hovnanian himself was a minority in Iraq, an Armenian Christian, who took over the small construction firm founded by his immigrant father and who, with the help of a Muslim partner who opened the door to government contracts, grew to become the country's largest road builder, with 1,200 employees. When one new Hovnanian highway opened into a Baghdad suburb, King Faisal II joined in the inaugural festivities. But not long after, in the summer of 1958, an army junta toppled the government and assassinated the king. The contracts quickly dried up. They wanted to become a socialist government, and whoever was somebody, he was not friends of the country, Hovnanian says. At 36, he left the country with his wife and young family - not almost broke, he says, just broke. He traveled first to London, then to Philadelphia, where his three younger brothers had attended college and settled into new lives. Hovnanian lived in a row house on Roosevelt Avenue with his in-laws, who had immigrated earlier, and explored the city and its suburbs, studying who was building what, and where and how. One of his brothers-in-law had married a small-scale builder in Toms River who touted a piece of property there. The four Hovnanian brothers each kicked in $1,000 and one brother-in-law - the Vosbikians, garden-tool manufacturers prominent in Philadelphia's Armenian community - put up a $20,000 guarantee that they could borrow against. Until the houses at Holiday Estates started selling quickly, Kevork was the company's sole full-time employee. His brothers kept their day jobs. One piece of advice that they ignored was about naming the company. I said, `Look, if Levitt could put his name, why can't we put Hovnanian? says Kevork, who resisted suggestions that he Americanize his name to Kevin or George. His brother Hirair became Harry, Jirair became Jerry, and Vahakn became Bob. Do I look like a Kevin? he asks. I said, `Do me a favor, call me Kevork Hovnanian, and if I'm worthy, they will learn the name.' Their next move was 30 miles up Route 9 to Manalapan, where great swaths of farmland lay just south of the suburban tide that had just begun to seep down from the north. The models acquired names - the Empress bi-level, the Dutchess split-level, the Countess ranch - and multiplied on the wholesale lots there were the favored units of development at the time. The brothers built more than 1,000 homes at Holiday Estates North and Yorktown, closing on as many as 40 in a single day. They turned an old apple warehouse into a prefabrication plant, assembling walls and roof trusses that were then plugged into frames at the building site. Because Manapalan had no downtown, they built one - in the innovative form of a strip mall. I didn't know anything, except I followed all the big developers, Hovnanian says. I thought, if they could do it, I could do it. In absolute numbers, I don't think it could be done again, says Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Builders Association, of the Hovnanians' rapid rise as home builders. When the brothers started out, the entire public policy of the nation viewed housing as a priority. Now public policy constrains housing in many more ways. But even then the brothers Hovnanian heard a sound that would inevitably follow them wherever they built. It was the aggrieved voices of those who believed that the world, or at least the neighborhood, was better off before builders like the Hovnanians came along to crowd it with new homes. No! No! went the cries from the audience at a 1963 planning board in Manalapan in response to a request from the Hovnanians to reduce the township's minimum residential lot size from 20,000 to 15,000 square feet - a change that would have allowed the building of several hundred more houses in the proposed Yorktown development. The loudest protests came from the newest arrivals, residents of the adjacent Holiday Estates North. To let this in, one resident accused members of the board, you must be figuring on moving out or selling out, or you're out of our right minds. You don't want anyone to come in, Kevork Hovnanian countered. In a few years we'll have 150 million Americans with no homes. By 1969, the company had grown sufficiently large and ambitious that the brothers, as Kevork says, decided to be brothers and not partners. We all wanted to be the decision -maker for our destiny, so the best thing was to amicably split, he says. The field was getting too small for four players and four able people, so we said `Before the lawyers start talking to us, let's finalize this, let's split this four ways. Everybody takes what they want and we move from that. For the first project of K. Hovnanian, his new solo company, he looked at a difficult piece of property stuck between a highway and a densely settled neighborhood in Freehold, and remembered the Philadelphia row houses of his first year in America. Members of the local zoning board weren't quite sure what he was describing; attached houses, to their thinking, were creatures of the city. So he flew nine board members to suburban Reston, Virginia, to see the new breed of townhouse that he had in mind. Hovnanian got his variance. Kingsley Square Town Houses are really the only intelligent way to deal with skyrocketing real estate costs, the ad declared, and the first dozen units, starting at $18, 450, sold within two weeks, before the models were even finished. Shifting demographic modes, Hovnanian next started building retirement villages adorned with golf courses, swimming pools, and clubhouses, like Shadow Lake Village in Middletown and Covered Bridge in Manalapan. He visited Florida for a bankers' convention and, enamored of a climate as warm and welcoming as any he had known since leaving Iraq, decided to build there too. More Covered Bridges opened in Pennsylvania, Texas and Georgia. I was a contractor and I know what the hell construction is all about, and there were a few mistakes here, but they weren't bad, says retiree Al Margarella, who moved from Staten Island twenty years ago and in 1997 helped organized the community's 25th-anniversary celebration, which included a visit by Kevork Hovnanian. The recession of the mid-seventies narrowed Hovnanian's ambitions and means for a time. But in the early eighties he started building townhouses again, in the first rumblings of a real-estate boom that would surpass everyone's forecasts, hopes and fears. I'm quite certain we did not say, `Gee, look at the baby-boom generation. They're just entering their entry-level housing years. Let's do this product,' says Ara Hovnanian, the middle of Kevork Hovnanian's five children and his only son. I think we kind of accidentally stumbled upon it, but quickly realized that there was a huge demand there and then really began to understand the dynamics of the baby-boom generation. As a boy, Ara Hovnanian endured his father's cigars and rode with him on weekends to inspect the job sites. I'd sit in the passenger side of a car that reeked of smoke-it always just about made me sick, he says. After studying at the University of Pennsylvania - he finished a five-year joint bachelor's and master's program in four years - he joined his father's company, a small percentage of which he had received as a graduation present in 1979. One Saturday morning in 1983, Ara was driving from his home in Middletown to Lincoln Park in Morris County for the opening of the company's third Society Hill complex, a name he had suggested that recalled the historic Philadelphia neighborhood he had admired during his college years. The directional signs to the complex were confusing, he thought, and he was preparing to chastise somebody for carelessness, when he turned the corner and saw a line of 100 people waiting to get into the sales trailer. I just couldn't believe it, he says. The first two had done very well, but we never had people in line. Society Hills began sprouting all over the state, in cities like Newark and rural townships like Galloway. The townhouses were real standard, bread-and-butter products, in Ara's words 1,000 to 1,500 square feet, no basement, no customization, minimal options, but offering a great value for baby boomers eager for their first home and an end to rent checks. In 1985 in Franklin Township in Somerset County, 1,000 people lined up in a snowstorm for a crack at one of 350 units. Advertisements began announcing archly one per family, as if the condos were limited-edition Cabbage Patch dolls. When the company offered 344 townhouses in Bernards Township, starting at $175,000, 8,000 people filed into the former Brendan Byrne Arena for a lottery. The Nets cheerleaders whooped it up and Kevork Hovnanian drew the numbers. Every unit was taken that night. George Lerner bought his townhouse - a $78,000 two-story, two-bedroom end unit in the very first Society Hill, built in the mud of an apple orchard in Old Bridge -after inspecting it for less time that he would have spent trying on a new suit. I liked the way the sun was coming into the bedroom, he says. I came down the stairs with the salesman and looked him in the eye and said `Okay, let's write it up, Seventeen years later, the grass has spread, the trees have grown, the toddlers at the pool have become teenagers, and Lerner, a 57-year-old salesman, is still there. The construction in some places was hasty and flawed. In Old Bridge, groundwater seeped behind the brick-front facing and collected in the heat ducts that ran through the concrete-slab foundation. But after Lerner and other representatives of the homeowners' association trooped to Middletown for a meeting in Kevork Hovnanian's office, the company soon fixed the problems. Other types of complaints proved harder to remedy. Schools bulged from the sudden population surges, traffic thickened, tempers shortened. People who didn't live in K. Hovnanian homes were angered by the invasions, while people who did were grateful for the equity they had acquired. I wanted to be known as the least-expensive home producer in the state, says Kevork Hovnanian, whose ambition has been aided by New Jersey's Mount Laurel court rulings encouraging the building of affordable housing. It created some kind of loyalty among his customers, he says of his decision not to raise prices in the face of such huge demand. I said, I don't want the company to be known as `make the money regardless what you do.' But now we are covering the whole gamut of housing, so that policy is out.' Though the frenzy has long since subsided, some people still do camp out for K. Hovnanian openings - not so much for cheap townhouses, but for $360,000 four-bedroom estate homes. I didn't think they would for this one, says the company's marketing vice president, Gabe Pasquale, about Woodland Estates, a 27-home development in Scotch Plains. But they did-hoping to pick the best lot location and lock into a preconstruction price for a home that they can expect to rise in value by the time they move in. And in Wall, so many prospective buyers camped out recently for homes in a new retirement community that the company invited them to wait it out inside one of the models. By the late eighties, just before the real estate bust that weeded out many other builders K. Hovnanian started easing out of townhouses and into single-family detached homes. The company's target market was moving up in means, and the company moved up with them. They practiced life-cycling riding - they rode the life cycle of the baby boomers, says Rutgers demographer James W. Hughes. As New Jersey's baby boomers began to outgrow their condos, K. Hovnanian was waiting to give them backyards and garages. The truly successful builder in the nineties is selling to the people who are making a killing on Wall Street or who are moving into the executive suits, says Patrick O'Keefe, who notes that the median price of a new home in the state has topped $210,000. Profits now are being fed by upgrades. The buyer who can afford a house of that price brings to bear a lot of discretionary income. And when the baby boomers become empty nesters, K. Hovnanian will have a tennis court reserved for them at a retirement village. Active adults now account for 30 percent of the company's target market, the same percentage as move-up buyers. The rest is divided at the camp like rituals typical of age-restricted communities (10 percent), and entry-level shoppers (10 percent). They're always thinking a few steps ahead, preparing for what's around the corner, says Susan Bady, senior editor of Professional Builder, the trade magazine that publishes a yearly ranking of what it calls the 400 giants of the homebuilding industry. K. Hovnanian, which received the magazine's National Housing Quality Award in 1997, stands at number 14 in the most recent rating, with $900 million in 1998 revenue. (The Pulte Corporation in Michigan tops the list at $3 billion; no other New Jersey company appears among the top 100.) K. Hovnanian already builds one of every ten new homes in New Jersey, but its ambition is to build even more, to remain in the cluster of large national companies at the top of an increasingly consolidated industry. We're a few years behind banking, Bady says, but ultimately, I think we'll end up with a handful of really huge mega-builders and then the small local guys, with the medium-size guys getting squeezed out. Some would say home-building is a real estate business, says Ara Hovnanian, who took over K. Hovnanian as CEO and president in 197. We view it as a manufacturing business. And the surest way to make more money in manufacturing is to manufacture more quickly. Forty years ago, the homes at Holiday Estates in Toms River each took six moths to build, standing idle and bleeding money for days at a time between subcontractor visits. A Hovnanian house today takes just over half that time, as electricians, plumbers, and drywallers are shuttled through more efficiently. In a recent Hovnanian experiment in Lakewood, with builders working at the pace of an Indianapolis Speedway pit crew, an entire house went up in four and a half days. But while speed is good for profits, it hasn't allowed for improved aesthetics. The basic model of a K. Hovnanian development hasn't changed much, a point seized upon by the company's critics. They've got a good product, but they've got a terrible site plan, says Tony Nelessen, a Rutgers professor who also rums a small consulting firm that assists in municipal planning. They're doing the same things they were doing twenty years ago except now with better lampposts. There's no place to walk except to the pool. At a time when the word sprawl has entered the language as an epithet and politicians of all stripes preach about preserving open space, the State Development and Redevelopment Plan is stirring to life in the shelf where it has gathered dust since its adoption in 1992. In rough terms, the state plan calls for concentrating pockets of development throughout out the state. There's largely no problem in getting people to buy into the `reduce the density' part, says Ara Hovnanian, who spent seven years on the state's Council for Affordable Housing but was not involved in formulating the state plan. The problem is that places that are logical to develop, that are near the infrastructure -near the roads and water and sewer - don't want to increase the density. The ultimate responsibility for getting things right isn't the builder's. It's the state's, says James Gilbert, the former chairman of the State Planning Commission. But Gilbert believes that K. Hovnanian's great size and influence - it ranks among the state's largest political donors -endow the company with a greater degree of responsibility. They ought to be a voice for change, and they haven't been, he says. As far as the state plan and the idea of `smart growth,' they had the opportunity to show some leadership, and they haven't shown it. But developers, Ara Hovnanian points out, are not social engineers, and New Jersey is already the most restrictive state in which the company builds; while it typically takes three to four years to get the necessary approvals for a new development here, the waiting period in North Carolina, the company's next largest market, rarely exceeds nine months. What his company builds, says New Jersey's largest builder, is only what the home-buying public wants. The demand is where the demand is, he says.

"Assembly Representatives Attend Catholicos's Funeral: Assembly Extends Condolences at Time of Death Armenian Assembly representatives joined over 5,000 mourners for the July 8 funeral of His Holiness Karekin I, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians. An Assembly delegation, led by Assembly Board of Trustees Chairman Hirair Hovnanian and his wife Anna, and including Associate Trustees Hagop Kouyoumdjian and his wife Ica, Associate Trustees Haroutune and Shake Mekhjian, Fellow Trustee Flora Dunaians, Board of Directors Member Michael Haratunian and Assembly Yerevan Office Director Arpi Vartanian attended the July 8 funeral service at the Holly See of Etchmiadzin. Religious leaders from around the world joined Armenian and Karabagh government officials in the four-hour funeral rite. It took place in the of Etchmiadzin and its principal celebrant was Aram I, Catholicos of Cilicia, the sister catholicosate of the Armenian Apostolic Church. He was attended on the altar by the Armenian Church Patriarchs of Jerusalem and Constantinople (Istanbul). The representatives of a number of national Orthodox Churches, including Cardinal Edward Cassidy representing Pope John Paul II, attended the funeral mass. His Holiness Karekin I succumbed to throat cancer June 29 in Etchmiadzin. He was 66 years old. The Catholicos's body is interred at Etchmiadzin next to His Holiness Vazken I, the previous Catholicos of All Armenians. The Assembly delegation also participated in the Hokejash reception dinner later that evening which was attended by Armenian church leaders, representatives of other churches, and Armenian and Karabagh government officials, including the Armenian President, President of Parliament, Prime Minister, the Nagorno Karabagh Foreign Minister, and other Armenian government officials. The delegation attended memorial services on Sunday in Etchmiadzin and Monday at St. Sarkis Church in Yerevan. They participated in Tuesday memorial services and the procession transporting the Catholicos's body from Yerevan to Etchmiadzin. Immediately following the Catholicos's death, the Armenian Assembly extended its condolences to the family of His Holiness Karekin I, and to His Eminence Archbishop Garegin Nersisian, Vicar General of the Holy See of Etchmiadzin, on the occasion of the death of the Catholicos. Catholicos Karekin's compassion, wisdom and leadership will be sorely missed by Armenians worldwide, said Armenian Board of Trustees Chairman Hirair Hovnanian. As the first Catholicos elected in an independent Armenia, he met the challenges of revitalizing the Christian faith damaged by years of communism. Hovnanian visited the Catholicos regularly during his illness, spending days and nights with him as his condition worsened. The Assembly will sponsor a memorial forest in Armenia dedicated to the memory of His Holiness Karekin I. The 500-tree forest, containing both fruit-bearing and decorative trees, will be planted this fall by the Armenia Tree Project (ATP). ATP staff will visit the forest three times each year to verify that the trees are growing unharmed.

"Prof. Robert Hewsen to be Nikit and Eleanora Ordjanian Visiting Professor of Armenian Studies at Columbia University This Fall Professor Robert Hewsen, a Professor of Russian History at Rowan University and a noted specialist in the historical geography of Armenia and Caucasia, will be teaching a graduate-level course this fall in Columbia University's Armenian Studies Program on The Americans in the Middle East - XVth Through XVIIIth Centuries (Course #W4352x). This Course, which will be taught on Thursday evenings, 6: 10-8:00 p.m., from September 9 through December 9, will focus on one of the most neglected periods in the study of Armenian history. Yet, it was in this period that the Armenians became not only a major force in the commercial life of the Middle East but also became the major links between Middle Eastern commercial activity and parallel activity in Russia, India and Western Europe (particularly in Holland). In addition, this period saw the destruction of Armenian independence and the birth of an Armenian independence movement; the decline of Armenian culture and its revival under Western influence, the rise of Roman Catholicism among the Armenian people and the revival of the Armenian Church, the establishment of the major Armenian diaspora communities and the development of the various techniques of survival employed by the Armenians under Muslim rule. Through an examination of the sources, this course will survey the Ottoman and Safavid administrations of Armenia, the policy of the these empires in regard to Armenia and its people, the rise of the Armenian diasporas, and the emergence of the Armenian people as a major force in the commercial development of Ottoman, Persian and Russian trade. Emphasis will be placed on (1) the forces which impacted the development of the Armenian people in this period and the impact of the Armenians on the people around them, (2) the techniques of survival employed by the Armenians under alien rule, (3) the revival of Armenian national activity and (4) the decline of Armenian culture after 1375 and its revival after 1700. The course will conclude with a survey of the state of the Armenian people at the dawn of the modern age. The course is open to both matriculating and non-matriculating students. Auditors may take the course for a fee of $375 and Life Long Learners (people over the age of 60) for a fee of $225. Registration begins on August 9.

"Armenian Reverend Awarded French Medal Reverend Robert Sarkissian has served as pastor to the French Protestant Church of Beirut, Lebanon for the past 29 years. Throughout the many years of civil war, the church met to worship on Sundays and these meetings were open to people from every faith and ethnic group. Rev. Sarkissian also worked to make the church a locus on which Muslim-Christian dialogue could take place. Due to this service, among many others, by decree of the President of the Republic of France, Rev. Sarkissian was awarded the French ensign of Knighthood of the National order of Merit, in a special ceremony held this spring. Robert Sarkissian was born in 1929, in Marseilles, France to Armenian parents from Erzeroom. He was educated there and received his Master of Divinity from Aix-en-Provence. He then pastored in Marseilles and the surrounding areas. He visited Lebanon several times during his early life (which included a period of military service as Captain in the French Army) but he finally settled there, with his wife Terese, in 1970. At that time, he had come to Beirut to study Armenian for two years, When he was about to leave and return to France, he was approached with a request that he stay in Beirut and work as director for the Karaguezian Foundation (an Armenian medical and social aid institution), Rev. Sarkissian saw himself primarily as a pastor and, consequently, was in some doubt as to whether he should work with the foundation or not. He decided to accept this position, and simultaneously to accept the responsibility of tending to the French Protestant Church, the pastor of which was leaving. Rev. Sarkissian was only meant to tend to the church until someone else was sent to look after it, but a replacement was not sent, and so he has continued in his pastoral role, as a volunteer, to this day. The award ceremony, which acknowledged the Reverend's life of service, was held in the French Ambassador's residence in Beirut. Many local French and Armenian dignitaries of ecclesiastical and political significance were in attendance, along with Members of the Lebanese parliament. The Ambassador of France, Mr. Daniel Jouanneau, spoke regarding Rev. Sarkissian's life of care for the church and particularly of his role as a catalyst for reconciliation between Muslims and Christians during a time of civil and national strife. The Ambassador went on to mention Rev. Sarkissian's contributions to the Karaguezian Foundation - the Reverend founded a branch of the Foundation In Armenia and extended the number of its clinics in Syria and Lebanon from 3 to 15 - as well as his participation in the Armenian Evangelical Union, his work at the Center for Armenian Handicapped in Lebanon, and his role as Board Member of Haigazian University. Ambassador Jouanneau noted that Rev. Sarkissian well represented the Armenian character: hardworking, faithful and diligent. Finally, the Ambassador pinned the silver cross with blue ribbon over Reverend Sarkissan's heart - the site which had generated so many good works of love. Rev. Sarkissian was quick to thank all those who supported him in his years of labor. He mentioned the French Protestant Federation and the Karaguezian Committee, among others. Later he added that he had meant to thank his wife, who deserved half, if not more, of all praise, but the French Ambassador had taken the opportunity to do so before he could. Following this remarkable ceremony of shared thanks, the Ambassador hosted a Champagne Reception in the palace hall where the celebration of Rev. Sarkissian's numerous contributions to Lebanese, French, and Armenian life continued into the evening.","Atmajian, Grace",Armenian Reporter International,1999-06-26,0
"Turkey's last Surviving Armenian Village - Vakif - or in Turkish, Vakifli Koyu In Turkish koeyue simply means village, or in Armenian kyugh. Vakifli is perched on the southern slope of Musa Dagh, or Mount Moses, overlooking the Mediterranean and within eyesight of the Syrian border. Orange and mandarin groves circle the village. The air is pungent with jasmine. Coming upon this community of 135 ethnic Armenians in Turkey, the visitor has the odd feeling of having found the last Mohican somewhere in the wilds of New York's Central Park, or a Jewish shtetl in contemporary Poland, or an Azerbaijani village in today's Nagorno-Karabagh. With Zeytuniye and Samandag, the Vakifli parish counts 290 members of ethnic Armenian origin. There are some 1500 Armenians living in the Mediterranean coastline zone, from Samandag to Mersin. Today, Vakif is a peaceful farming community and is quite prosperous, judging by its homes, cars and tidy appearance. In addition to Armenians, Vakif is home to one Kurd and one Turkish Muslim family. The village church has recently been reconstructed and expanded. A plaque on the wall says the church was renovated in 1994-97 with assistance from the Turkish government. It is true that the church complex has been reconstructed, but it was not expanded. Moreover, the government is secular and does not help any of the religious communities (Muslim, Christian or Jewish) to renovate houses of worship. However, the Turkish government allowed and approved of the renovation project. The day this reporter visited Vakif, the mayor was just leaving and had no time to talk. The priest was away ministering to the Armenian community in nearby Antakya (Antioch), where he spends every other week meeting with 35 Armenian families there. But Bedros Kehyroglu, a local farmer who helps look after the parish office and church, had time to talk. He says the Armenian community in Vakif enjoys 100 percent autonomy. In his words, since there is democracy in Turkey, the government lets the people manage the village themselves. Every village in Turkey is managed by the villagers themselves - through an elected village chieftain, called muhtar and an elected Council of Elders called Ihtiyarlar Meclisi. He says the Armenian community is not under any pressure from political parties and points out it was under the pro-Islamist Welfare (Refah) Party that Ankara subsidized reconstruction of the church. Ankara did not subsidize the project, but approved it. The former Patriarch Karekin I, Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul, made an appeal to the Armenian community in Istanbul for the cost of the renovation. A small group of believers from Istanbul provided the money for the project. Busloads of Armenian residents of Istanbul, of whom there are several thousand, pay visits to Vakif and Antakya. There are 60-65,000 Armenians living in Istanbul. There are regular pilgrimages organized from Istanbul, twice a year, during Great Lent and on the feast of St Mary in August. Nearly 100 came last month with the patriarch, crowding into the church for a service and then spending their time playing backgammon in the local teahouse. The last pilgrimage was on Palm Sunday, 28 March. Immediately after the Divine Liturgy, the pilgrims left the village to visit historic sites in the Cevlik area. No time was spent in the village teahouse playing backgammon! Vakif's Armenians are undergoing gradual linguistic assimilation by the Turkish majority. While the older generation can read and write in Armenian, most members of the younger generation cannot. Those who want to learn Armenian have to go to an Armenian boarding school in Istanbul, where they are taught in Turkish but attend lessons in Armenian as a foreign language. In the Armenian minority schools in Istanbul, 19 in number, Armenian is taught as the mother tongue of the students. Apart from Armenian and Turkish, English is taught as a foreign language. The ethnic Armenian owner of the teahouse in Vakif and a nearby beach hotel, Garbis Kus, says although his mother tongue is Armenian, he can't speak or write in Armenian. As a child, he attended the local Turkish school. When asked if he has a message for the Armenian diaspora, Kus responds in a way that reveals the politically delicate position of this isolated community: There are Armenians in different places, but everyone lives his own life so we have no connections with the others living elsewhere. He made the remark in Turkish and declined to do so in Armenian. Arab and Kurdish inhabitants of nearby villages are in a similar predicament because of difficult relations between Ankara and Syria as well as constitutional restrictions. What constitutional restrictions? Insurgents of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) occasionally cross into Turkey from bases in Syria. Posters for alleged PKK terrorists alleged are plastered all over Antakya and Samandag and truckloads of security troops are a frequent site. All school instruction, news media, and public signs are in Turkish, as prescribed by the Turkish Constitution of 1982, which was imposed by the military before it returned the country to civilian rule. Article 42 stipulates that no language other than Turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to Turkish citizens at any institutions of training or education, except for Armenian, Jewish and Greek school which enjoy certain minority rights. An additional clause says foreign language instruction shall be regulated by law. The last Armenians on the slopes of Musa Dagh face an uncertain future as they gradually lose the ability to communicate in their mother tongue and are assimilated into the Turkish mainstream. Their lifeline remains as a holiday retreat for Istanbul's insular Armenian community. No Istanbul Armenian goes to Vakifli for holidays. There are no inns or motel in the village. Only previous Vakifli villagers spend their summer vacations in the village, usually around the feast of Saint Mary on 15 August.

"Why Are Armenian Leaders Acting Like Slaves in the Freedom of the US? In 1990, when the US Senate was considering S. J. 212 to commemorate the anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, a document was issued under the auspices of The Armenian Church as the ultimate intellectual presentation of the Armenian genocide of 1915-1923 (no as massacre, holocaust, extermination, as presented by State Department officials), in which the tabulation of the population of survivors up until 1918 was shown to be 592,200. However, did these Armenians not suffer the genocide from 1918-1923, the official beginning and ending dates established by the same intellectuals, clergy, revolutionaries and historians? This authoritative document was misleading as it failed to show all the relevant information since 1918 as to what happened to the 592,200 survivors from 1923 on. Actually the Armenian genocide was extended to 1928 by the missionary/admiral censorship on all Americans in Turkey to mislead Americans at home supporting the starving Armenians, Armenian martyr nation, albeit promoted by the director of Near East Relief (NER, Public No. 25 - 66th Congress [S.180] activated in November 1918 but not signed by President Wilson on August 6, 1919 after his betrayal of Americans, Armenians and all humanity at the Peace Conference, January-June, 1919). This misrepresentation by both Armenian-American leaders and the then missionary leaders and admirals is moral/intellectual/political/social slavery in the freedom of the US, insulting to every American, the Armenian martyrs, survivors and their descendants who are used and abused as mannequins for clergy, revolutionary parties, scholars in their ivory towers supported for the pride of the wealthy. Why has the The Armenian Church submitted to this slavery of ignorance in terms of what happened to the 592,200 Armenians after 1928? Why has the Armenian Evangelical Union ignored all the evidence provided by Rev. Hampartsoum Ashjian and Rev. Abraham Hartunian relating to the genocide, holocaust slavery and extermination that occurred after the Armistice without victory of President Wilson from November 1918 to 1928? When are the American Armenians, as US citizens, as veterans of American wars, as contributors to American industry, science, evangelism, commerce, arts, enterprise, inventiveness and literature, going to awaken to their responsibility to make American principles of government effective for all humanity, as demonstrated by President Clinton in the NATO war against the brutality of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, being remedied under the authority of the United Nations? We survivors of massacres, holocaust, of service to the whole Muslim world but deportation, robbery, abuse, slaughter, extermination, holocaust have been muffled by this slavery of the clergy, intellectuals, revolutionaries, historian in their ivory towers supported by the pride of the wealthy and their scapegoats.","Mahjoubian, Charles N",Armenian Reporter International,1999-05-22,0
"IRELAND CALLING: Miresevini Ne Killarney Kossovare By John Spain MIRESEVINI -- that's Cead Mile Failte in Albanian. So you can probably work out for yourself that the headline above means Welcome to Killarney our Kosovar Friends. That was the message on dozens of posters carried by local people who turned out in the pouring rain at the tiny Farranfore Airport in Co. Kerry on the southwestern tip of Ireland at 1 a.m. this past Tuesday morning to greet the first planeload of refugees from Kosovo to arrive here. On board the aircraft were 22 extended families, 138 people in total, including a few old people and some babies. As they emerged into the soft Irish rain -- a perfect introduction to Ireland -- they wept and hugged each other. The 200 Kerry people who had stayed at the airport throughout the night, to prove that the Irish reputation for generosity and hospitality is not a myth, cheered and waved. The Kosovars were stunned at the warmth of the welcome and the size of the crowd. The decision by the Irish government to bring them into the small Kerry airport -- about as far away from Dublin as you can get -- proved to be an inspired one. The spectacular Kerry scenery and the mountains and the lush greenery all around must have seemed like a home from home to the Kosovar refugees, whose own country is very similar in terrain and beauty. Equally important, of course, was that the Kosovars are largely a rural people, from prosperous country towns like those you find in Kerry, and so they have an instant rapport with the hardy country people of the county we call The Kingdom. When the hugging and the tears at the airport were over, the refugees were whisked away from the airport on a fleet of waiting coaches. In the early hours of the morning, with the light breaking over the lakes and mountains of Kerry, they were moved to a large and modern hostel building in Killarney and a comfortable convent building in a castle in Cork, the county next door. The accommodation they have been given is of the highest standard and the refugees will be warm and comfortable, well fed and well looked after. The accommodation is self-catering. Translators from the Irish Refugee Agency are on hand to help them settle in and adjust to life in Ireland. Bosnian refugees -- who are familiar with the Muslim faith of the refugees -- have also come forward to help with the operation. The Bosnians were settled in Ireland a few years ago after the conflict in their homeland. At present the curious media is being kept away from the refugees to give them time by themselves to come to terms with their new situation. But a few of the refugees have come through the security around their accommodation to express their gratitude for the welcome they have been given in Ireland. The overall plan is to take 1,000 refugees into Ireland. They will be brought in on one or two flights a week over the next four or five weeks and they will be housed in accommodation across the country. Only around 250 of the 1,000 will be settled in Dublin. The idea is to give them and us a better chance to get to know each other and to learn to live together. However, although the 1,000 refugees will be broken into smaller groups -- Dublin, 250; Limerick, 100; Galway, 100; Waterford, 100; Sligo, 50; Mayo, 50; Laois/Offaly, 100 and Drogheda/Dundalk, 100 and so on -- the groups will not be smaller than 50 so that the families can support each other and learn together. The refugee housing bill will run to an estimated *14 million this year for the Irish government although the overall cost of the operation will probably be double that. Unlike asylum seekers or illegal immigrants, the Kosovar Albanians will be entitled to work or open businesses during their time here. They have been admitted to Ireland on 12 month residency visas and these will be extended as required. The point about these refugees, however, is that they do not want to stay here. They are grateful for the Irish welcome and hospitality, but all of them want to return to their homes in Kosovar as soon as possible. How soon that will be depends largely on NATO and the Serbs. Very few of them speak any English and that will make it more difficult for them to get work here. But, as the world has seen, they are a resourceful people and may indeed manage to pay their way while they are here (they will, of course be entitled to all the normal welfare benefits). The overall point, however, is that instead of wanting to put down roots here they want to get back home as quickly as they can. Although they are being accommodated in institutional buildings at the moment, they are likely in time to be moved into regular housing which the government will be renting from private landlords on their behalf. One refugee who managed to talk to the media at the airport was Agim Bytyqi, who had arrived with his wife Afrodita and their two sons Drion, 5, and Petrit, 8. Speaking for all the refugees he said, Irish people are very generous, very nice people. Thank you very much for welcoming us. Agim was a financial executive with a construction company in Kosovo before they were expelled by the Serbs. His wife had been approaching her final year in medical school when she was thrown out of university a few years ago because she was a Muslim. They had come from the East Kosovo town of Shaskovo. They had been expecting the Serbs for weeks, and when four Serb cleansers arrived at their door on a Sunday morning a couple of months ago they were packed and ready to go. But the Serbs would not let them take the suitcases. The only thing they were allowed to carry was the chicken casserole lunch Afrodita had spent the morning cooking. The house was burned behind them and for the next six weeks they went through an appalling vista of horror as they made their way to the border with Macedonia. They walked by day, slept in the woods by night and scavenged and begged for food. In retrospect they realize how lucky they were to get through alive. Afterwards Agim heard that his 70-year-old uncle, a retired farmer, had been shot on the spot by the Serb militia when he asked if he could release his cattle before he left rather than leaving them to starve in the barn. Agim and his family were the first refugees to ask to be sent to Ireland from the huge refugee camp outside the Macedonian capital of Skopje. The reason that so few were opting for Ireland was simple -- they had never heard of this little country perched out on the Atlantic edge of Europe. Agim was different, however. His reason for wanting to come here was simple, also. He has two younger brothers here, who fled from Serb intimidation some years ago, were given asylum here and are now married to Irish women and have children born here. Both have worked their way up to be managers of the restaurants where they used to wait tables. They were on the tarmac at Farranfore Airport to meet Agim and the family and it was an emotional reunion. Just a few weeks ago they thought that Agim and his family were dead. It was through them that Agim was able to pass on the heartfelt thanks of all the refugees on the flight to the crowds at the airport. With a connection like that to Ireland, settling here should be easy for Agim, although he still wishes eventually to return to Kosovo. For the other refugees it will be more difficult. In comparison with what they have been through in recent weeks, however, the difficulties that lie ahead will seem very minor indeed. And they have the enormous goodwill of the Irish people to help them make a go of it. Photo (Kerry doctor Eamon Shanaghan pictured with two refugees.)","Spain, John",Irish Voice,1999-05-18,0
"Istanbul Armenian Patriarch Visits Armenian Communities in Iskenderun, Antioch His Beatitude Patriarch Mesrob II of Istanbul and all Turkey commenced the Holy Week services in the Hatay province, in Southern Anatolia, as he visited the Armenian churches and communities in the region for the first time since his enthronement as patriarch. On Thursday, March 25, Patriarch Mesrob, joined by a group of clergymen and the members of the Lay Council of the Holy Mother-of-God Patriarchal Church, participated in the traditional farewell prayers in the Patriarchal Church, during which prayers were said for the Lord's blessing for a safe trip, a successful visit and a spiritually uplifting pilgrimage. The Patriarch then left Istanbul in his official automobile, accompanied by the Very Reverend Aram Ateshian, Chairman of the Spiritual Council, and a lay official of the Patriarchate. The weather was very agreeable, and the journey on the interstate autobahn very swift, as the Patriarch travelled through the Biblical regions of Bithynia, Galatia and Cappadocia. About four o'clock, the travelers passed through the historic Cilician Gates and entered Biblical Cilicia, first arriving in Tarsus where Saint Paul was born. They then drove through Adana, passed by the majestic Yilankalesi Castle, then turned south along the Amanos range (Syav Ler), through Dortyol and finally arrived in Iskenderun (Alexandretta) at 6:30 p.m. His Beatitude was welcomed to Iskenderun by the Parish Council members of the Armenian Church of Karasun Mangunk (Forty Martyrs of Sebastea), headed by Mr. Garbis Kisadurian. His Beatitude then had dinner with the Parish Council members in the Alexandretta Restaurant of the Ontur Hotel where he spent the night. KIRIKHAN On Friday morning, March 26, Patriarch Mesrob received the members of the Parish Council of the Armenian Church of Saint Gregory the Illuminator in Kirikhan, headed by Mr. Abud Mardigian. The council members informed His Beatitude that the Kirikhan Armenian community members had moved en masse to Iskenderun, leaving behind two families only. The roof of the church building had collapsed and it was no longer possible to hold worship services in the church. The vakif (public trust) of the Kirikhan Church owned some property and the Parish Council wished to transfer the ownership of the property to the Armenian Church vakif of Iskenderun, in the same Hatay province, since the Kirikhan residents now lived and worshiped in Iskenderun. As to the run - down church building itself, the council members wished to sell it and transfer the sum to Iskenderun for the use of the Armenian Church there. ISKENDERUN CEMETERY At 11.00 the same day, Patriarch Mesrob visited the Armenian plot in the municipal cemetery of Iskenderun. Some twenty community members and six clergymen accompanied the Patriarch as he held a service (hokehankisd) for the repose of souls. The Patriarch also examined the monumental tomb erected in memory of the deceased members of Armenian Literary Society of Iskenderun (Hay Krasirats Miutiun). Early in the afternoon, the same day, His Beatitude was escorted via the Belen mountain pass (the ancient Syrio-Phoenician Gates) to Antakya (Antioch) - capital city of the Hatay province today and the ancient biblical settlement where the followers of the Savior were first called Christians. His Beatitude paid a courtesy visit to the Governor of Hatay, during which the two individuals discussed the future of the Armenian Church of Kirikhan. Later, His Beatitude also paid a courtesy visit to the Mufti of Hatay. The dialogue between the Patriarch and the Mufti was aired simultaneously by the local radio in Hatay. THE FRANCISCAN CENTER At 7:30 in the evening, His Beatitude visited the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation where he was welcomed by the resident priests, headed by the Father Superior of the Franciscans in Turkey. The Patriarch was also greeted by a group of believers to whom he gave a brief pastoral message in preparation for Holy Week. During the warm reception, His Beatitude presented the Franciscans a large wooden hand-made clock on which historic Armenian monastic centers were beautifully carved. MEDIA COVERAGE On different occasions during the day, His Beatitude met briefly with the local media representatives, especially Hatay TV, Cinar TV and the TRT Hatay, along with newspaper correspondents. The Patriarch gave messages of greetings on the occasion of the feasts of the Jewish (Pesah), Christian (Easter) and Muslim (Sacrifice) communities peacefully co-existing in Hatay. The Patriarch also expressed concern, sadness and pain at the plight of refugees in Kosovo and prayed that the armed conflict would end as soon as possible and refugees could return to their homes to rebuild their lives. He condemned all sorts of racism and ethnocentrism, which he termed ancient diseases that could prove self-destroying. COMMEMORATION OF THE RESURRECTION OF LAZARUS On Saturday morning, March 27, His Beatitude Patriarch Mesrob commenced the Holy Week in the Armenian Church of Karasun Mangunk in Iskenderun. The Divine Liturgy was celebrated by one of the pilgrims, the Very Rev. Abgar Hovhannisian, Pastor of the Armenian Church of Batum in Adjaria, Georgia. Patriarch Mesrob, in his homily, reminded the faithful that the great miracle in Bethany is the anticipation of the final triumph that the Lord Christ was going to win over sin and death one week later. Following the liturgy, the Parish Council of the Iskenderun Church held a lenten luncheon in the Saray Restaurant on the sea, honoring His Beatitude and the patriarchal entourage. SAINT PETER'S CAVE At 16.00 hours, the same day, the Patriarch presided over the Lucernarium (Giragamudk) service in the grotto commonly called Saint Peter's Cave. Some 200 pilgrims from Istanbul, Ankara, Kayseri, Yozgat, Elazig, Malatya, Mersin, Adana, Iskenderun and Samandag also attended the Liturgy of the Word that followed. His Beatitude's homily was about the spiritual life of the first Christian community in Antioch. Representatives of the Roman Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox communities in Antioch were also present in this most moving prayer time. At 5:30 and 6:30 p.m. respectively, His Beatitude the Patriarch and the pilgrims visited the Roman Catholic and Antiochian Orthodox churches in Antioch which are both called Saints Peter and Paul. At 8 p.m., the Antiochian Orthodox Community headed by Archpriest Paulos Samuel Sabagil held a lenten dinner in the Aspava restaurant by the sea in Samandag (Seleucia Pieria). PALM SUNDAY On March 28, His Beatitude the Patriarch and the pilgrims celebrated Palm Sunday in the Vakifli Village on Mousadagh in the district of Samandagh. It was indeed a joyful celebration as the residents en masse welcomed His Beatitude at the entrance of the village, with drums and doudouks, salt and bread, folkloric dress and white pigeons, young men and women dancing to local tunes. A natural procession was formed from the village square to the northern high point in the village where the Holy Mother-of-God Church stands in maternal dignity. The bells of the church heralded the arrival of the Patriarch, as the young acolytes began to sing the Hrashapar hymn, saluting their hierarchy from the apostolic line of Saint Gregory the Illuminator, and successor of the holy patriarchs Hovagim Brusatsi and Hovhannes Golod. His Beatitude celebrated the Palm Sunday Divine Liturgy, and just before the Nicene Creed, he delivered the homily in which he reminded the faithful of the tears of the Lord overlooking Jerusalem. He said that much remains unchanged after nearly 2000 years, not only in the Holy City, but in other parts of the world such as in former Yugoslavia. He said that things were not much different in the First Century A.D., but with unwavering faith they that invited Jesus of Nazareth into their hearts, as the one who came in the name of the Lord, made a difference and a lasting impact on the world. Following the Divine Liturgy, in the cozy church yard, a Palm Sunday procession was formed with crosses and olive branches; His Beatitude and the accompanying clergymen turned east and west, north and south, proclaiming the entrance of Christ through the gates of the Holy City, as the Lamb of God who comes in self-sacrifice for the expiation and propitiation of the sins of the world. His Beatitude then visited the cemetery of the village where hokehankisd prayers were said. Following the services, the Parish Council of the Holy Mother-of-God Church and the Armenian Mayor of the Vakifli Village hosted a luncheon in honor of His Beatitude. Patriarch Mesrob spent the rest of the afternoon visiting with lay leaders of the Iskenderun Armenian community and later drove to Adana where he spent the night. On Holy Monday, March 29, His Beatitude and company travelled back to Istanbul and arrived in the Patriarchate around 8:00 p.m. Map (Area in square -- province of Hatay in southern Anatolia.)",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1999-04-17,0
"Archbishop Barsamian Issues Appeal to Help Victims of Crisis in Kosovo: Primate Urges Faithful to Help Victims of a Tragedy Which Resembles the Plight of the Armenians 84 Years Ago Responding to the misery of the refugees caught up in the Kosovo crisis, Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, issued the following appeal to all Diocesan parishes on April 8, 1999: The news reports this week from the former Yugoslavia have presented a horrifying spectacle to the world - but I sense that the stories and images have been especially disturbing to us Armenians. Deportation; refugees; genocide. Words we've all grown up with - words whose terrible familiarity is only softened by the hope that our world may have learned something from the misery of our forebears over 80 years ago. And yet today, in 1999, on the eve of our memorial to the Armenian Genocide of 1915, we are hearing these very words again. Watching the recent news footage of suffering, displacement and death, one can only imagine that, had television cameras existed in 1915, the plight of the Armenians would have looked very much the same. I am sure that many in the Armenian-American community have shared this shock of recognition. And I am confident that, just as the memory of our sorrow 84 years ago was re-awakened, so too was our resolve to aid the victims of this tragedy. With this in mind, I am appealing to all Armenians to help the refugees in Kosovo and its surrounding regions. Donations are being collected through the Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR), which has already received an initial contribution of $10,000 to jump-start this appeal. I strongly urge you to encourage your parishioners to support this cause. They should earmark their donations for Kosovo Relief, and forward them to the Fund for Armenian Relief. Those wishing to contribute to this effort may contact their local parish priest or parish council chairman, or they may send contributions (Memo: Kosovo Relief) directly to the Fund for Armenian Relief, 630 Second Avenue, New York NY 10016. AMAA Aid To Kosovo Refugees The Armenian Missionary Association of America (AMAA) donated the sum of $10,000 to provide humanitarian relief for the Albanian refugees fleeing Kosovo, according to a statement by Rev. Movses B. Janbazian, the Executive Director of the AMAA. Although Kosovo is a distant land and the Albanians are predominantly Muslim, all refugees who have been driven from their homes and homeland suddenly and violently with little or no resources, need help to survive, and they need such help urgently. The refugees are huddled together in makeshift camps in locations far from their former homes and homeland. Food, shelter and medicines are needed to keep them free of malnutrition and disease while their future is being determined by forces beyond their control. The current tragedy in Kosovo reminds Armenians of the merciless genocide unleashed by Turkey against innocent Armenian civilians in 1915. The parents and grandparents of today's Armenians were among the survivors who managed to escape the Turkish government-perpetrated massacres that took the lives of 1.5 million innocent Armenian men, women and children. The Turks emptied large parts of Armenia of its lawful inhabitants, and scattered the survivors of the genocide throughout the world. The memory of their own tragedy makes Armenians particularly sensitive to the suffering of people who are subjected to ethnic cleansing, wherever and whoever these victimized people may be. As an Armenian missionary organization, the AMAA shares the grief to those who are affected by the crisis in the Balkans and condemns the barbarous practice of ethnic cleansing. As an expression of its Christian concern, the AMAA has established a special relief fund to help the victims of the war in Yugoslavia. These funds will be channeled through the United Church Board of World Ministries (UCBWM), an American AMAA colleague agency. Working closely with the Church World Service and Witness Unit of the National Council of Churches in the USA and the Switzerland-based Action by Churches Together (ACT), the UCBWM is providing tents, foodstuffs, medicines, blankets, infant food, and other relief goods to the refugees. The AMAA has also sent appeals to Armenian Evangelical Churches worldwide, asking that they pray for peace in the Balkans and other trouble spots in the world, and they remember the victims of the war in Yugoslavia with special prayers and relief collections. A direct appeal is also made to all concerned individuals for this purpose. Those who wish to contribute to this humanitarian effort may send their tax-deductible donation marked Kosovo Relief to: Armenian Missionary Association of America, 31 West Century Road, Paramus, NJ 07652.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1999-04-17,0
"Karabagh Armenians and Kosovo Albanians The war in the Balkans probably will continue for a while and the biggest losers so far appear to be the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo. The war was started with the intention of protecting ethnic Albanian civilians from Serb excesses. Yet the NATO air strikes prompted the Serb offensive on the ground in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands of displaced people and refugees began an exodus to neighboring countries. NATO's military intervention didn't prevent or stop the human tragedy; on the contrary, it accelerated the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo Albanians. Why? Because the initial intention of reinstating Kosovo's autonomy and providing humanitarian assistance to its populace soon degenerated to the idea of toppling Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and changing the balance of power in the region. Therefore, the noble objective of saving ethnic Albanian civilians was not met, since the priority now was shifted to the realization of other political objectives, mainly to eliminate Serb control not only in Kosovo but in Montenegro as well, blocking Serbia's access to the Adriatic Sea. US & NATO VS. RUSSIA Now political observers worry about the US and NATO's credibility, on one hand, and the sagging prestige of Russia, on the other, depending on the final outcome and change in the regional balance of power. In both cases, the implications will be felt elsewhere in the world. According to the recent assessment by political observers, short of the deployment of NATO ground troops in Kosovo, it would be very difficult to secure and reestablish the self-rule of the ethnic Albanians in the province. At the present moment, hundreds of thousands already are fleeing to neighboring Macedonia, Bosnia, Montenegro, and Albania, helping Milosevic's plan to accomplish his ethnic-cleansing policy. Political, legal, and philosophical differences between the advocates and opponents of territorial integrity versus self-determination principles are making it very difficult to find a final solution to the conflicts in Kosovo, Karabagh, Chechnya, Abkhazia, and Kurdistan. Many conflicts remain unresolved because of the past mistakes of the imperial powers when they were arbitrarily drawing up interstate national borders without taking into consideration historical, cultural and ethnic realities. The boundaries were tailored according to the geopolitical interests of the major powers. The US and Russia will take no action based on the merits of each conflict and territorial dispute; they will only be interested in keeping the status quo or will reach decisions based on their geopolitical and national interests. The issues of human rights, self-determination, democracy, and protection of internationally recognized borders all may become irrelevant when the national interests of the major political powers become more pertinent. BOMBING ACHIEVES OPPOSITE NATO's aerial bombing accomplished quite the opposite of the intended objectives, according to recent assessments by independent political observers. First of all, the Yugoslav strongman President Slobodan Milosevic, hated by most prior to the NATO bombing, now has became the most popular man in the Serbs' eyes. He has become kind of a national hero since nationalist sentiment is uniting the Serbs against what they perceive to be foreign aggression. Second, the Albanians, who were supposed to be protected from the Serbs, are now fleeing by the hundreds of thousands and leaving behind hundreds of burning villages and dead, and the demography of territory is changing perhaps permanently. In the not so distant past, Armenians faced a similar tragedy in 1915 in the regions of the Ottoman Empire inhabited by them. The Allied powers watched helplessly while 1.5 million of them perished. Observers now believe that, in order to reverse the situation on the ground in Kosovo, the US and NATO have to introduce ground forces of 150,000 men, provided that all member countries will give their consent, thus widening the scope of war and causing more death and destruction. In the end, the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo will be in the same situation as the Armenians of 1915, if the US continues to wage this war with two contradictory objectives. The first objective is to protect the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and the second one is to reestablish the former autonomous status of the Albanians in Kosovo. Under similar circumstances in 1920, the Allied powers tried to protect the territorial integrity of Turkey while attempting to create a homeland for the Armenians, but they failed in their objectives and caved in under Turkish political intransigence. VARIED REACTION The reaction to the Balkan war differs in various corners of the globe and is contradictory. The Russians, traditionally and historically, where considered to be friends of the Serbs but, except for rhetoric and lip service, they offered no concrete help, which should be a wake-up call to the Armenians, who should be more determined to rely on their own forces in the future. With their hands tainted with blood in the Kurdish region of Anatolia in pursuit of a more brutal ethnic cleansing policy than Milosevic, the Turks are condemning the Serbs for committing genocide against the Muslim Albanians as they conveniently forget their past conduct against Armenians. The Iranians, who are considered to be antagonistic to US policy, are now siding with the Muslims of Kosovo and indirectly supporting the aim of the NATO members. Tiny Azerbaijan, while denying the Karabaghis self-determination rights, is insisting on recognition of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity; it is siding with the separatist Kosovo Albanians and is conveniently ignoring Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. The Azeris are also offering to send a contingent of Azeri troops, along with Turkish troops, to protect the Kosovo Albanians. Armenia's government, while defending self-determination rights for Karabagh Armenians, is openly siding with the Serbia and advocating preservation of peace through negotiations. As mentioned above, the US is waging a war against Belgrade but with the intent to preserve Yugoslavia's territorial integrity. If the US acts otherwise, it will be accused to using double standards, since the Turks are conducting a more violent policy of ethnic suppression against the Kurds. POLITICAL ABANDONMENT & DUMPING Hypocrisy, from A to Z, is common in world politics, and the Armenians have firsthand experience when it comes to political abandonment. Remember, we used to be called a little ally of the French, British, and Americans. We were also called starving Armenians by the Near East Relief organization after the genocide of 1915. We are all familiar with what happened after 1920; the Turks claimed Western Armenia, and the Armenian lands, through the Treaty of Lausanne, were accepted de facto by the Allied powers as part of Turkey. Today, the Turks are proclaiming that there are no Armenians living there, the genocide didn't happen nor did Armenians ever live there, and, further, that the Armenian claim that they once had their own established state in eastern Anatolia is all Armenian propaganda. Armenians can learn lessons from this Yugoslav and Kosovo tragedy, especially those naive Armenians who never learned their lessons from the 1915 genocide under the Ottomans, or the 1988 pogroms under the Azeri offensive in Karabagh. It is odd that naive Armenians are very upset that Armenian nationalists are placing so much emphasis on past Armenian sufferings, and asking for the impossible from the Turks. According to former Foreign Minister Alexander Arzoumanian, ranking member of the ANM-HhSh party, Asking for recognition of the genocide from the Turks, territorial claims, financial compensations, and demanding independence for Karabagh are all nuisance. Furthermore, Arzoumanian is criticizing President Kocharian for antagonizing the Turks. Instead, the former foreign minister and his supporters in the Diaspora are advocating that it is about time to reconcile with the Turks, yet they have no answer as to how to accomplish this, since former President Ter-Petrossian tried and failed. TURKISH DEMANDS FOR RECONCILIATION The Turks are not interested in reconciliation, unless their demands are met. Those demands are precise and include the following: Armenians should agree that the genocide never happened; it was a civil war and Armenians killed an equal number of Muslims and Turks. There is no ground for territorial or financial compensation; this case was closed with the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Finally, Karabagh should be recognized as Azeri territory. Later demands will include the following: Armenians should kick the Russians and Iranians out of the Caucasus and become friends of the Turks and Azeris. From this point on, everything will be all right for the Armenians. Armenians also should realize several other important facts. First: The major powers will follow their own national interests, and they may use potential ethnic and national conflicts for their own political purpose. If it is not in their national interests, they will dump you. Cases in point: the dumping of the Armenians in 1915-20, the abandonment of the Greeks in 1920 in western Anatolia, the Jews in Europe in 1939-45, and the dumping of the Kurds in recent history, which is still continuing. Second: In order to maintain national security, citizens have to rely on their own military strength and political resolve, and taking preventive measures is the only way to deter aggression. The Karabagh Armenians have learned their lessons from the past. They organized defense forces, protected their land and freedom, defeating the enemy, and successfully ensured their national security. Israel did the same thing against hostile powers and succeeded. The Vietnamese defeated every major power, including France, the US, and China. The Kurds and Kosovo Albanians so far have failed because they couldn't create a national consensus; they couldn't organize and depended heavily on foreigners for assistance. Third: Inform and educate the public opinion that principles, cause, and historical and legal rights are valid. Also educate your own people that, in order to protect the land, you have to stay on your land, invest in your land, serve your land and organize and form strong military, paramilitary and security forces. Don't depend only on international agreements since guarantor parties often change their alliances depending on circumstances. SHIFTING ALLIANCES The admission of the former Warsaw Pact member countries - Poland, Hungary, and Czech Republic - to NATO proves how alliances can shift. Dismemberment of the former US ally Yugoslavia and, by the same token, abandonment of Yugoslavia by its Slavic brother Russia are reflections of the new realities which prove that your independence cannot be guaranteed with alliances and treaties alone. Under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Iran used to be US's main ally in the Persian Gulf. Now it is considered an enemy of the US. The abandonment by the former Soviet republics of Georgia and Azerbaijan of their alliances with Russia and their formation of new military alliances with Turkey represent a remarkable shift of political orientation. The Israelis, erstwhile protector of Kurdish rights, are now siding with the Turks and forming an alliance with them, thus undermining the Kurdish cause. The list goes on and on, and the lesson is, never trust others, rely on your own strength. The conflicts and suppression of the ethnic groups in Kosovo, Kurdish region of Turkey, and Caucasus show the vulnerability of the small nations. They all have similar characteristics, located in geopolitically important regions, in between adversary and rival powers and close to energy sources and transportation routes. As part of ethnically diverse regions, they are all separated by historical enmity and artificial boundaries, and used by other powers for their political designs.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-04-17,0
"U.S. Department of State: Armenia Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1998 Released by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor February 26, 1999 Part IV of V SECTION 5: DISCRIMINATION BASED ON RACE, SEX, RELIGION, DISABILITY, LANGUAGE, OR SOCIAL STATUS Discrimination based on race, sex, religion, disability, language, or social status is prohibited by the Constitution. However, cultural and economic factors prevent women, ethnic and religious minorities, and persons with disabilities from participating fully in public life, and the religion law discriminates against some religious groups. Women There is no specific law banning violence against women. Few cases of rape, spousal abuse, or other violence against women were reported in this conservative, patriarchal society; however, their number is likely higher than the statistics indicate. In the first 11 months of the year, the Prosecutor's Office registered 25 cases of rape. There are no separate statistics for other instances of violence against women. The law (the old Soviet code) cites specific punishments for rape, forced abortion, forbidding a woman from marrying, and discrimination in hiring due to pregnancy. In view of the phenomenon of Armenian women working as prostitutes in the Middle East, it is likely that trafficking in women and girls is more of a problem than the Government and women's organizations have recognized. In the workplace, women receive equal pay for equal work, but generally are not afforded the same professional opportunities given to men and often are relegated to more menial or low-skill jobs. The 1992 Law on Employment prohibits discrimination in employment, but the extremely high unemployment rate makes it difficult to gauge how effectively the law has been implemented to prevent discrimination. According to a women's group, women make up 69 percent of those officially registered as unemployed. Currently there are more women receiving university and postgraduate education than men. Children The Government does not have the economic means to provide fully for the welfare of children. Education is free, universal, and compulsory through age 16, but facilities are poor and teachers are forced to tutor pupils privately to survive. Free children's health care is available, but of poor quality, with an increasing trend toward overt or concealed payment of fees for service. Girls and boys receive equal educational opportunities. The Government focuses its efforts on children's rights and welfare with measures to insulate large families - those with four or more children - from the effects of the country's current difficult circumstances. The Government similarly directs foreign humanitarian aid programs toward large families. Despite social programs, the problem of street children remains significant. The family tradition is strong, and child abuse does not appear to be a serious problem. People with Disabilities The Constitution provides for the right to social security in the event of disability. The 1993 Law on Invalids provides for the social, political, and individual rights of the disabled but does not mandate the provision of accessibility for the disabled. In its current economic circumstances, the Government has difficulty fulfilling its commitments in this area. The Government's enforcement of the rights of the disabled remains rudimentary. Legal safeguards for those with psychiatric problems are inadequate to protect patients' rights. There is societal discrimination against the disabled. Hospitals, residential care, and other facilities for the seriously disabled do not meet international norms. The Health Ministry and the U.N. Children's Fund hosted a conference on disabilities in August that brought useful new attention to the subject from various international organizations. Religious Minorities There was no reported violence against minority religious groups. However, newer religious organizations are viewed with suspicion. Six members of Jehovah's Witnesses were in detention at year's end, and a seventh was free on probation. They were charged with draft evasion or, if forcibly drafted, with desertion. Another 20 were reportedly in hiding from the draft. Alternative nonmilitary service is sometimes available for persons willing to act as teachers in remote villages, an option not offered to members of Jehovah's Witnesses. A leading Armenian Apostolic Church cleric published a virulent press attack on Jehovah's Witnesses in September, calling them servants of the Anti-Christ. Some other religious groups previously have been accused of proselytism, including using material inducements or offers of emigration to entice converts. A relatively high percentage of members of some of these religious groups, particularly Hare Krishnas but evangelical Christians as well, joined the wave of emigration from the country, for social, economic, and philosophical reasons. Despite the previous Government's pledge to apprehend those alleged Yerkrapah members, who staged a series of destructive attacks against a dozen religious groups in 1995, the authorities took no steps during the year to bring the perpetrators to justice. National/Racial/Ethnic Minorities In his inaugural address, President Kocharian made special mention of the rights of the country's national minorities. The Government does not discriminate against the small, officially recognized, `national' communities, though their economic and social situation has deteriorated substantially since independence in 1991. Groups that the Government includes in this category are Russians, Jews, Kurds, Yezidis, Georgians, Greeks, and Assyrians. Following the Protracted Nagorno-Karabagh conflict there is no significant Azeri minority. The several hundred Azeris or persons of Azeri heritage still living in the country maintain a low profile in the face of societal discrimination. The Constitution grants national minorities the right to preserve their cultural traditions and language, and the 1992 law on language provides linguistic minorities with the right to publish and study in their native language. There are token publications in minority languages, but the Government has devoted minimal resources to maintaining minority language schools. The large network of Russian-language schools has been reduced greatly in recent years. In practice virtually all students, including members of the Yezidi and Greek communities, now attend Armenian-language schools with very limited classes in their mother tongue. In the Yezidi community, a high percentage of pupils do not attend school, partly for family economic reasons and partly because of discrimination from ethnic Armenian schoolmates an and teachers. Yezidi leaders met with the new Government and the President's human rights commission in July to repeat long-standing complaints that their community (which speaks a Kurdish dialect and practices a traditional non-Christian, non-Muslim religion) is subject to discrimination by police and local authorities. They cited numerous incidents of unfair adjudication of land, water, and grazing disputes, nonreceipt and lack of police response to even serious crimes committed against Yezidis. The Yezidi complaints likely reflect societal discrimination as well as the general problem of poorly functioning local governing bodies. The Commission reaffirmed the Government's commitment to improving the situation but took no specific steps.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1999-04-10,0
"Multifaceted Problems in Multiethnic States: Ethnic Homogeneity Through Population Exchange; Analysis and Comments - Part IV of V INTRODUCTION TO PART IV Ayhan Aktar, who is an Associate Professor of Sociology in the Department of Political Science and International Relations at Marmara University, offers two quotations: One is from the Greek philosopher Euripides (431 BC) who said, There is no greater sorrow on earth than the loss of one's native land; the other is from a Turkish parliamentarian, Tunal Hilmi Bey, Deputy from Zonguldak (1924 AD), who said, If they had any luck, the refugees. The first are words of wisdom and concern; the other is evidence of Turkish cynicism. It is not clear to us which view Prof. Aktar endorses. In his paper he gives mixed signals. PRE-LAUSANNE TREATY, NEGOTIATION PERIOD In pursuit of his assigned mission, on October 12, 1922, Nansen sent a memorandum to the Turkish representatives and confirmed it with a letter outlining his decision to deal with the problem ...of an exchange of population between Greece and Turkey. At the same time he informed Greece about his plan in terms of how to proceed. On October 13, 1922, Venizelos, Prime Minister of Greece, sent a telegram expressing his agreement to Nansen's proposition. The Turkish side also accepted it, adding not to allow the further presence of Greeks on Turkish soil... Going a step further, they proposed ...compulsory exchange of Greek ad Turkish populations. The Turks insisted on this condition as a better option of exchange over the voluntary. This new element became the subject of long debates. Turkey ...felt that the question of minorities revolved around two key factors: ...interference by the Great Powers in the internal affairs of the country under the pretext of protecting minorities... As ...Turkey viewed its Greek minority avowedly irredentist and thus sought to be rid of them. Under the compulsory exchange variant, Turkey insisted on ...including the Greek Patriarch, that was supporting Constantinople Greeks' political aspirations. These irredentist aspirations were reminiscent of the times when Constantinople was populated chiefly by Greeks, who were the natives of the region before the fall of the region before the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the invading Turks. The dreams for recovery of those lands had not yet faded and that made the Turks suspicious, blaming the Greeks for irredentism. Seeking a solution to this inextricable situation, Lord Curzon suggested that the Patriarchate lose its political and administrative character and become a purely religious institution. The contention was that this final variant of the exchange agreement provided more lasting peace by removing the potential for the renewal of the conflict. Under the circumstances, notwithstanding the misgivings about the compulsory nature of the exchange, it was considered an unavoidable necessity. In one of the papers presented at the Conference, quoting from Alfred Zaya's book, Nemesis at Potsdam, referring to the proposed solutions of the displaced people in Europe at the aftermath of World War II, four reasons are put forward: 1) the hope of securing a lasting peace by eliminating minority problems. 2) the need to compensate Poland for its loss of territory in the east. 3) the belief that transfers could be carried out humanely... 4) ...desire to punish Germany. Certainly, all these actions can not be applied to all cases, nor under a solution sought by both parties in the Karabagh dispute. Finally, it should be noted that selectivity exists in allowing this kind of resolution. It is applied in some cases, while being ignored in others. In the Karabagh dispute, Azeri oil resources play an important role. The Great Powers support the Azeri claim of Karabagh being part of their territory over Karabagh's push for self-determination and most likely will continue to do so. And this, notwithstanding all the evidence that, ethnically and historically, that territory was part of Armenia. In contrast, under Jewish irredentism, Israel's claim is that two millennia ago the land belonged to the Jewish people. The expulsion of Palestinians during the war with the Arabs was followed by a refusal to allow repatriation of the Arab refugees and the establishment of a Palestinian State. DEMOGRAPHIC CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAUSANNE TREATY The Lausanne Treaty is seen, even today, as a victory by the Turkish Nationalist forces that were fighting for succession of the Ottoman Empire and preparing the ground for the establishment of a republic. A second step was the transfer of the capital of the new republic from Constantinople to Ankara in the heart of Anatolia. This treaty was a loss for the Armenians who were promised independence according to the Articles of the Treaty of Serves. The ancillary Convention to the Lausanne Treaty, for population exchange between Greece and Turkey, had an important impact upon the human topography, particularly in Anatolia and Thrace, on the European side of the country. The exchange had begun during the latter days of the war between Greece and Turkey when Greeks fled from Izmir in Turkey to Greece. In this instance, the transfer was already a fait accompli. Because of the size of the refugee population, it showed the effects of a large-scale migration. It has also led to the deportation and efforts of extermination of the remaining Armenian community of the region. According to the admission of Prof. Zafer Toprak, a professor at the Bogazici University, in economic terms the havoc wrought by the wars was ... considerable and ...the emigration of the Greeks and Armenians also meant the exodus of the large majority of entrepreneurs and managers. With them went an irreplaceable stock of industrial and commercial know-how. International trade ...in 1923... already ...was one-third of what it had been ten years earlier. The bourgeois class was in major part ...non-Moslem merchants, bankers, middlemen. Even in towns of the interior where Moslem Turks were the majority, Armenian dominance in the economy was prominent nevertheless. The population exchange between Turks and Greeks, and the annihilation of Armenians, caused a major loss in the economy of the country. The Convention and Protocol on the Exchange of Population is one of the ancillaries of eighteen instruments under the Lausanne Conference on the Near Eastern Questions. Apparently the signatories all agreed to this solution of the refugee problem. And, being compulsory, it increased the chances for its success. As the minutes of the Peace Conference suggest, the first to propose the idea were the Allies. The real reason...behind was the fact that the Allies thought a radical solution... to the problem, under the situation, was necessary. The Greeks did not initially support the variant of compulsory exchange. Rather, they supported the voluntary exchange. Under the pressure of circumstances, however, the Greek Prime Minister Venizelos declared that he was ready to discuss the issue. The Turks, on the other hand, supported the proposed compulsory exchange variant. Turkey had embarked on a ...full-scale nation-building process and her non-Muslim minorities were considered a real stumbling block in this endeavor. THE LEGAL/SOCIO-POLITICAL ASPECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSFER This exchange of population, specifically under compulsory terms as against a voluntary condition, created a number of legal problems, particularly in the initial stage. It complicated matters by creating new legal precedents for future such agreements. It established the legal rights of nationalist governments to expel large bodies of their one-time citizens beyond national borders. The transferees actually became emigrants by being removed from what they considered for many generations their native habitat, becoming estranged migrants, aliens under their new environments. Adding to their frustrations were the bad handling of the operation, the loss of their lands, their houses, their furniture, their personal belongings, and their friends who did not fell into the same category. These people had to leave everything behind, from their homelands to neighbors... - the lands where they were born and lived for generations past. Some of them did not even understand the language of their new countries. These were Greeks speaking Turkish, and Turks who spoke Greek. However, ...their problems were more or less confined to one generation... - to the older generation. Adding to their frustration was the fact that they were never considered by their host-states as their own people. They were isolated and compelled to live a separate life, sometimes even under harassment. And according to some observers' opinion, this ...negative attitude never diminished with the passage of time. This reminds this author (HJT) of his own experience. As a former repatriate to Soviet Armenia during the late 1940's, he witnessed a similar attitude by the natives toward the newcomers. It should be noted that this attitude which we had to endure seems to be embedded in human nature, and Armenians were no exception. Today, from this distance in space and time, such attitudes between natives and newcomers should be taken less passionately, with more understanding, and without holding grudges. EXCHANGE OF POPULATIONS, A PROCESS OF UNMIXING PEOPLES UNDER SAME NATIONAL ROOF Under the heading of The transformation of Turkish nationalism, Ayhan Aktar States: It is quite well known that Turkish nationalism was first formulated and codified as a clear-cut ideology during the years of the Balkan Wars. The theoretician of Turkish nationalism was Ziya Gokalp (1876-1924). Gokalp admits that the Turkish people are an amalgam of Central Asian Turkic peoples (racial root) with an immense amount of inoculations of Anatolian natives' blood: Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians and of the rest. In ...his writings Gokalp argued that the nation was not an ethnic or racial entity. For him the criteria for membership to national community was cultural rather than being ethnic racial. For him definition of nation is: ...not a racial, ethnic, geographical, political, or voluntary group or association. Nation is a group composed of men and women who have gone through the same education, who have received the same acquisitions in language, religion, morality and aesthetics ... Men want to live together, not with those who carry the same blood in their veins, but with those who share the same language and same faith. (Gokalp, 1959:137). In terms of language, religion, even culture between the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, there exists a sameness, yet they are different nation states. Ayhan Aktar, further commenting, states that: While Gokalp well-defined individuals' ties to national community more on cultural therefore civic lines, the Republican elite replaced with an ethnic definition of it. However, in both instances, in face of the existing differences in the racial amalgam and even the culture between Turkey and Central Asian Turkic people, claims of sameness is an irrelevant exercise. Yet, Gokalp's ...emphasis on Islam should be seen as a moral force to realize social solidarity, and as a necessary condition for being a Turkish nationalist. Yet, sameness does not exist between Turks and other peoples by virtue of the same Islamic faith; take the Arabs, for example. Let's look on the other hand, at Dr. Ryza Nur's version. Defining nation, he supports the thesis of ethnicity being the deciding factor, and his theory became ...the constituent element of official Turkish ideology. In contrast, again, referring to Prof. Aktar's explanations, the new regime in Ankara, being stripped of its imperial traditions and confined to a ...Turkified human geography of Anatolia... [the new regime] ... made it intangible to provide an umbrella to cover Greek tinker, Armenian tailor... etc. and adopted ...a sociologically defined Gokalpian culture which functioned as a collective conscience and believed to have homogenized the Turkish people even though they were divided by lines of status, class, religion, sect and in some cases ethnicity was not meaningful anymore. Hence these dual claims, by contradicting each other, remained moot and contentious for us, if we understand correctly Aktar's explanations.","Touryantz, Hagop Jack",Armenian Reporter International,1999-03-20,0
"Armenian Students Win Historic Vote on Berkeley Campus A rainbow coalition of University of California students, in a broad showing of support last week, voted unanimously to support Armenian students, and drafted a resolution demanding that the University reopen its investigation and urge a University of California professor to apologize for a verbal assault he made upon Armenian students last year. On the evening of March 10, 1999, the UC Berkeley Armenian Students Association (ASUC) achieved a great victory - some would say historic. The ASUC Student Senate, composed of a broad coalition of students from diverse backgrounds, passed a unanimous resolution demanding that the University urge Prof. Hamid Algar to apologize for his actions of last April 24, 1998. Last year Prof. Algar, a UCB professor in the Near Eastern Studies Department, approached the Associated Armenian Students table in Sproul Plaza where they were commemorating the Armenian Genocide and said to them that the Genocide never happened but that he wished it had. He further said that Armenians deserve to be massacred. After conducting a five-month investigation, the University, in its January 6, 1999 report, issued by the Chancellor's office, apologized for Prof. Algar's actions but concluded that although his actions were ethnically demeaning, his actions did not create a hostile environment for the students involved. Disappointed and outraged at this conclusion, the UCB Armenian Students' Association, in consultation with ASUC representatives, introduced a bill through the ASUC Senate to ask the University to review its decision. This bill, entitled A Bill Against Hate Speech and in Support of Reprimand for Prof. Algar, was authored by ASUC Senator Jorge Garcia and sponsored by a number of ASUC senators and ASUC President Preston Taylor. Wednesday evening, amidst a throng of nearly 30 people, crowded in a small conference room, including representatives from the Chancellor's office and the UCB Police, the bill passed unanimously with 17 votes in support and 0 against. Those previously unfamiliar with the incident were outraged that an ethnic group of students could be assaulted with such impunity by a tenured UC Professor. It is a heartening sign of solidarity with Armenian students that the Associated Student Body of UC Berkeley, composed mostly of Asians, Hispanics, and African-Americans, officially recognized the seriousness of this incident and formally disapproved of Prof. Algar's actions. The incident with Algar is believed to be the only time in the recent history of UC Berkeley that a professor has personally attacked a group of students out-side of academic discourse. Some believe that the University was unprepared to deal with such a situation and mistakenly treated the incident as a heated academic debate and not a personal attack on a group of individuals. Much credit for the success of this bill is due to ASUC Senator Jorge Garcia, and ASA members Shant Tchakerian, Kate Nahapetian, and Paul Maranian, who worked tirelessly in researching campus policies regarding faculty misconduct and in crafting the language contained within it. Each addressed the 25-member Senate on the floor, having prepared and distributed a packet of materials on the Genocide, provided by Richard Kloian of the Armenian Genocide Resource Center, to each Senator. ASA students found it very gratifying to hear Senators defend the historicity of the Armenian Genocide and advance their arguments for the passage of this bill. Senator Kevin Sabet, a member of the Bahai faith, was particularly supportive, citing the history of persecution of non-Muslim Near Eastern peoples. With this level of support, the ASA was able to append three additional clauses to the resolution from the floor during deliberations. A representative from the chancellor's office was present to answer questions regarding the issue. Senators concurred that her answers to Kate Nahapetian's probing questions were woefully inadequate. The ASA must now work to get the Academic Senate (faculty representative body) to follow suit. The groundwork for this has already been laid and the Resolution can be ratified in its present form in necessary. Most importantly, the issue is effectively out of the hands of the ASA and is now placed in the hands of the Student Body at UC Berkeley, although the ASA will be directing the enforcement of the resolved clauses from within the body. Concerned individuals may still write to the University, noting the precedent the University's action sets for future attacks of this nature. The University needs to be informed that this kind of behavior by professors cannot be tolerated and that the public is aware of the current situation and will be following their progress.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1999-03-20,0
"Their Numbers are Decreasing from Diyarbakir to Istanbul (Istanbul'da, Diyarbakir'da Azalirken): Book by Yelda Shows Bashing of Armenians and Minorities Is an Exercise in Success She is a fine-looking Turkish delight by the name of Yelda. She has born in 1961 in Istanbul. She studied news broadcasting and journalism and received her bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Marmara, Istanbul in 1988. She is married and has one son. After her graduation, she began to publish articles in Yeni Insan Dergisi (Young Person Magazine) and other various magazines and newspapers. She was a member of the Turkish socialist feminist caucus, and later she became an activist in the human rights movement. Mrs. Yelda's current interest is suppression and oppression of ethnic groups in Turkey. She co-chairs several commissions and tries to advocate minority rights (azinlik haklari), which is a very sensitive issue in Turkey. Human rights activists have to work under very difficult conditions, and their activities are under surveillance and close scrutiny by Turkish internal security agents. Any printing by the media of criticism of the state, particularly as it pertains to minorities, human rights, liberty and democracy, can be interpreted as advocating separatism and leftist ideology, or can be considered defamation of the Turkish state or the principles of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (Kemalism). CHALLENGING THE STATE Under these difficult conditions, Mrs. Yelda is risking her personal safety and profession by arduously challenging the Turkish bureaucracy and the rigid state apparatus which displays unyielding hostility against issues that she tirelessly writes about in the media. Many times, Mrs. Yelda has pointed out her distaste for narrow Turkish nationalism, racism, and suppression of minority cultures and rights in the past and present. She hosted a program on Turkish Television and openly criticized the official Turkish positions, past and present, particularly in the Armenian and Kurdish issues. In her book, Yelda considers minorities, Armenians, Greeks, Kurds, Assyrians, Nestorians, Hemshins (Armenian-speaking Muslims) Laz (Georgian-speaking Muslims) and Jews as being hostages used for political purposes. For example, the Greek and Armenian Patriarchates are being maintained in Istanbul in order for the Turkish state to claim to the civilized world that there is religious tolerance in the country. But, by the same token, Mrs. Yelda points out that the anti-Christian and anti-Semitic riots of September 6-7, 1955 in Istanbul were in fact organized and sponsored by the Turkish state to remind the Greeks that their unilateral actions in Cyprus might cause damage, death, and destruction insofar as Greek-owned businesses were concerned. Going into details, she elaborates on how the riots of September 6-7, 1955 were premeditated, organized, and executed by the state. How a special group of instigators and criminal elements were brought to Istanbul from the outskirts and Anatolia to engage in anti-Greek riots, committing murder, rape, destruction of property, and desecration of churches and cemeteries. During these riots, which continued for three days and nights, not only Greeks but Armenians, Jews, Assyrians and Nestorians all suffered, and many victims later immigrated to Greece, Israel, Armenia, and elsewhere abroad. WHO WAS BEHIND THE RIOTS? Mrs. Yelda later reveals, with astonishment, that the organizer and instigator of these events, Orhan Birgit, was government spokesman for Cyprus affairs. The fellow named Hasan Ucar, who planted a bomb in Ataturk's birthplace in Salonika, Greece, was instructed by Oktay Engin, an employee of Turkish Security Agency (MIT), in order to create a pretext for the riots. Later, Engin became Governor of Nevshehir. The Ankara government later accused communists and leftists of creating unrest in the country, and arrested suspects and put them in jail. Later, Yelda explains that officials in Ankara succeeded in intimidating Greeks so they would leave Istanbul en masse, abandoning their wealth and property. Furthermore, psychological pressure was applied on the Greek government to compromise in the Cyprus dispute. When the late President Celal Bayar in public asked his Prime Minister Adnan Menderes what the motivation was to commit such colossal destruction, his answer was to wrest economic control from Geeks, Armenians, and Jews and give it back to Muslims. JEWISH LEADERS COERCED In the same context, Mrs. Yelda points out how Jewish community leaders in Istanbul were coerced to appeal to American Jewry to exclude Armenian Genocide materials from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC, if they didn't want anything to happen to the Jewry of Istanbul and Izmir. Mrs. Yelda's honesty, knowledge, investigative and analytic ability sheds much light on the dirty past and present events that shaped the history of the Ottoman and Turkish states. She describes in detail how Turkish nationalists and government officials reacted against historian Tamer Akcam (the first Turkish historian to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide) and Mayor of Esenyurt Gurbuz Capan's visit to the Armenian Genocide Memorial in Yerevan. After they returned to Istanbul, Turkish nationalists labeled them traitors for advocating recognition of so-called genocide. Castigating the official Turkish position and academics for denying the reality of the Armenian genocide, and with her typical humanitarian approach, Mrs. Yelda condemns the perpetrators and deniers of these horrible events that shook the civilized world. Later she goes into detail to expose how the genocide was premeditated, organized, and executed. She points out that after the genocide, former Armenian lands, wealth, and properties were confiscated, based on a 1923 government regulations. This act itself was definite proof that the state's intention was to eradicate the Armenian presence in Anatolia. Not only were Armenians barred from claiming their property, but a special law was also passed that Armenian returnees couldn't constitute more than 10 percent of the local population, or form more than 50 households in any settlements. QUESTIONS ACADEMICS' HONESTY She questions the intellectual honesty of Turkish academicians, like Professor Turkkaya Ataov, for accepting the fact that, although many Armenians perished during the deportation (sevkiyat and techcir), this was not premeditated and preplanned, it was a war-time response and necessity because of Armenian insurrection. (The usual Turkish propaganda line which was recently adopted by some unfortunate Armenian historians as well - M.A.) Mrs. Yelda later mentions how when the bright German scholar Hilmar Kaiser and the Armenian-American historian Ara Sarafian attempted to gain access to Ottoman-Turkish archives, they were met with obstacles since Turkish officials considered the Armenian Genocide a political issue rather than a historical one. With precise analysis, Mrs. Yelda explains why the Turkish government prohibits discussion or publications of the Armenian Genocide and Armenian History and prevents publication of books related to the Kurds while encouraging the mushrooming publication of books related to Pan-Turkism or Pan-Turanism. She is also upset that Turkish state sponsors the publication of anti-Armenian propaganda books like Armenian Terrorism, Armenian Atrocities in Anatolia against Muslim Population, Armenian Cruelties in Anatolia, etc. AGAINST TURKISH RACISM Mrs. Yelda blames Turkish racists for destroying multiethnic and multicultural life in the former Ottoman territories and for forcefully Turkifying the land and creating Turkey for Turks only. She sees Turkish racism as the cause of deportations and massacres of the former indigenous inhabitants of Easter Anatolia, Armenians, and the present deportation and killing of the Kurds. She labels racism as a crime against humanity. Mrs. Yelda defends cultural rights for Kurds; she believes it is an inherited and undeniable right of every human being to be able to speak their own language, to sing their own songs and enjoy their own culture, free of any fear or government scrutiny. She expresses her bewilderment over why, in this day and age, the Turkish government places man-made obstacles in the path of minorities, like curtailing, Armenian and Greek education or preventing education in Kurdish. She also talks about the treatment of Jews in Turkey, despite the recent Turkish propaganda campaign that Jews and Turks are natural friends. Mrs. Yelda proves otherwise; namely, that this PR campaign is being conducted to use the American Jewish lobby for Turkish national interests. She disclose that in 1934 Turks sent threatening letters to Canakkale Jews, asking them to vacate their houses and leave the area. As a result, 15,000 Jews were forced to leave Thrace. In 1942-44, the unfair Welath Tax (Varlik Vergis), a form of state racketeering, was imposed on Jews, along with Greeks and Armenians. They were bled dry by the authorities' astronomical monetary demands and they were forced into bankruptcy so Muslims could confiscate their wealth and property. MORE ANTI-SEMITISM On December 11, 1949, the editor of the newspaper Hurriyet (Liberty) Sedat Simavi was forced to declare that his paper was not owned by Jews; rather, it was one hundred percent owned by Turks. What made this case ugly was that if you were a Jew, you were not supposed to own a share in a Turkish newspaper. A Muslim seminarian named Rifat Tunc distributed anti-Semitic propaganda leaflets in a mosque in Adana on November 6, 1992. In May 1993, an assassination attempt was made on Jack Kamhi, the head of the 500th anniversary foundation (Anniversary of Spanish Jews seeking asylum in Istanbul). The Jewish cemetery in Ulus was destroyed on April 4, 1994. An assassination attempt was made on Professor Yuda Yurum, leader of Ankara Jewry, in June 1995. The Turkish Religious Education Ministry publication History of Religions is full of anti-Semitic writings accusing Jews, along Nazi propaganda lines, for Germany's ills. Mrs. Yelda questions what has happened to Turkish Jewry. During the 1930s there were 50,000 Jews in Istanbul, 15,000 in Edime and 40,000 in Izmir, throughout Turkey, there were 200,000 Jews. With a natural population increase, today their number could have been about 800,000) yet today only 23,000 or fewer are left due to anti-Semitism. ARMENIAN EQUALS INSULT Mrs. Yelda regrets that, in Turkey today, the word Armenian (Ermeni) is being used to defame or humiliate somebody. False information is being spread in eastern and southern Anatolia that all the PKK leaders are Armenian, so people will hate the PKK since Armenian is synonymous with insult. Every Armenian, Greek and Jew should read Yelda's book Istanbul'da, Diyarbakir'da Azalirken. This book defends human and minority rights and advocates peace, brotherhood and love among nations. Mrs. Yelda's book should be translated into English, and she should be given a humanitarian award.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1999-03-13,0
"Multifaceted Problems in Multiethnic States: Ethnic Homogeneity Through Population Exchange; Analysis and Comments - Part II of V The main purpose of this study is to examine the conditions necessary to arrive at a resolution in the Karabagh dispute which would be acceptable to both parties. However, the mere attainment of that goal is not yet sufficient to assure security and achieve permanent peace. After the status is determined, the negotiations should continue to eradicate the conditions that are causing animosities between these two neighboring nations. One plausible measure that is being suggested in such situations is ensuring national purity by redressing the endemic ethnic minority problem, by creating racial homogeneity and national harmony. In Part One of this study, it has been mentioned that as far back as millennia ago, to attain this objective, ruling nations resorted to a series of measures that were brutal in nature. Such violence still exists, even in this day and age. Expulsion, deportation, mass killings and genocide are still the methods so very often practiced. Hence, Population Exchange, with all its hardships, has been increasingly considered to be the lesser evil, a necessary sociopolitical surgical operation of sort, to secure purity of nation and to eliminate causes of friction. To do a great right [by doing] a little wrong. Prior to the Lausanne negotiations about the minorities' question, the first two decades of the 20th century witnessed the unprecedented exodus of several hundred thousand Ottoman Greek Orthodox from Anatolia. During the same years too, a large number of Turkish and Muslim populations from the Balkans were displaced to find refuge in Anatolia, after the Ottoman defeat in the Balkan War. The Armenian deportation is a case apart, as it has been an irreparable tragedy. While displaced Greeks and Turks had countries they could go, the Armenian Genocide survivors had nowhere to go. The short-live first Armenian Republic was incapable of taking care of all surviving refugees. Hence they were pushed like herds of animals to the remote confines of the Empire; they were deported to the scorching desert of Jezireh in Syria. And, as we know, many of them perished through starvation and malady; many of them succumbed through exhaustion and died. Others were slaughtered on their way, and only a scant number survived. In contradiction to the persistent denials about the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish government, at one point Prof. Zafer Toprak of Bogazici University, in the paper he presented at this conference, admitted that when the Ottoman army retreated from some of the fronts, it had also led to the deportation and partial extermination of the Armenian community. Further down, he adds: It was an effective military tactic... However, deportations resulted in much inhumanity and mortality. Therefore, the Armenian community had shrunk to about 65,000. (Out of original estimates of over two million-HJT) The Lausanne Treaty, as Zafer Toprak affirms, ...is still seen in Turkey as the celebrated treaty... replacing the Sevres Treaty and preparing the ground for the establishment of the Republic. The Lausanne Treaty ...gave the Nationalists in Ankara the prestige and authority needed to formulate a new conception of nation state. By a new conception, Zafe Toprak means a state exempt of minority groups, a homogeneous nation. With its ancillary agreement for an eventual Exchange of Populations, the Treaty was sanctioned officially by the Great Powers. It had all the necessary conditions to develop into a precedent for the application of similar measurers in other parts of the world. However, in the aftermath of World War II, once again, forced expulsions and mass murders, now termed as ethnic cleansing, are still taking place in this day and age, even at the threshold of the 21st century, in many parts of the world. ETHNIC CLEANSING Ethnic cleansing is a term first used to describe expulsion and mass killings in Yugoslavia in recent years that has since been applied to the rest of similar cases around the world. This caused policy-makers to question whether there is not a more peaceful alternative to violence in the resolution of ethnic minorities' problems. Ethnic Population Exchange has become, in many minds, an alternative solution to eliminate multiethnic friction as opposed to brutal measures. MULTIETHNIC STATES There are situations, however, in which countries composed of diverse ethnicities could, and some of them can still, subsist under a supranational umbrella where race, national origin, religion and ideology are irrelevant issues. For the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, during their reigns, and for the US today, religion and national origin were and are non-issues. In the Soviet Union, China, and Yugoslavia, where ideaology was an accepted imposition, racial origin and national homogeneity were not issues. However, when that unifying ideology lost meaning as a consequence of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and a weakened socialistic system in Yugoslavia, nationalistic feelings emerged in each component nation. Rivalries and animosities developed between the rulers and the ruled, and between the ethnic minorities, both against each other and their respective rulers. Recently, the Bosnian experience and, more recently, the Kosovo issue, the various problems in the Caucasus, and the most significant one for us - the Armenian-Azeri dispute over Karabagh - are but a few poignant examples. Alienated people want their independence and freedom from their hitherto oppressive rulers. As a reaction, and in their efforts to curb all minority attempts for independence, the rulers are still resorting to violence. Today, more and more, the term ethnic cleansing is used in the context of designating policies whereby the actual aim is to drive out entire ethnic groups in an attempt to establish homogeneity, no matter how. In the lesser civilized countries, the rulers resort to harsher measures. In manifesting contribution and remorse, Germany, the more civilized among sinners, has expressed repentance and granted remuneration for the Holocaust victims. Turkey persistently refuses to express repentance and continues to deny that the Armenian Genocide had ever occurred. The obvious question is, where are the over two million Armenian natives of yesteryear in Anatolia today? MULTIETHNIC USSR VERSUS MULTIETHNIC USA The awakening of nationalism and the rise of ethno-nationalistic feelings, in recent years in particular, found its most salient expression with the collapse of the Soviet system in the former republics. The problem of ethnicity and emerging claims for self-determination within the confines of their native land has had a destabilizing effect on the maintenance of a greater Russia and, by extension, in international power politics, siding with the supporters of the status quo. Before its collapse, the Soviet Union, as one of the two largest and most complex multinational states in the World, comprised fifteen republics and some one hundred nationalities. The autocrats at the top of the central government spared no efforts to secure stability in the Union. At the Twenty-Second Party Congress in 1961, Khrushchev asserted that ...the Party has solved one of the most complex of problems, which has plagued mankind for ages and remains acute in the world of capitalism today - the problem of relations between nations. This optimistic assessment, however, has been replaced today by the somber acceptance of the reality of the collapse of the system. To understand the combination of success and failure, which brought the country to the Gorbachevian era of reforms, it is necessary to look at the evolutionary process of Soviet ideology. A strategy that supported both nationalism and socialism at the same time. They professed nationalism as an ideology of export to the countries under Western influence, and supported those dependent countries' claims of self-determination. They preached socialism for internal consumption in their efforts for unity. Socialistic internationalism as an ideology and practice, and the power of the system was concentrated in the hands of a predominantly Slavic central elite in a supranational state, with all the lineament of Russification. Yet, not surprisingly, the dualism embedded in this Soviet approach did not always work. Nationalistic feelings hibernated but did not die. The coercive policies of the Stalinist period, and thereafter of his disciples, which under their autocratic leadership had silenced the quest for ethnic identity, fostered the belief that the combination of repression and co-optation might indeed have succeeded in eroding national attachments. But under Khrushchevian relaxation of terror, under the new climate of the thaw, the revival of national sentiments daringly appeared. As regards the existing predicament of the multiethnic states, the US - the other largest multinational state - should not be considered a case similar to the Soviet Union. There exist two fundamental differences that should be clarified when referring to the American counterpart. In the United states there was no subdivision of separate republics. The US, a nation built by the assemblage of immigrants, even though it consists of separate states, yet never did it have ethnic concentrations holding to their national status of their countries of origin. The USSR, with its fifteen republics, is/was a union of territorially compact peoples that inhabited their historic homelands since centuries past. They were attached to their own traditions and their own culture, and had their own language. In the United States, on the other hand, people dispersed over the territory without significant national concentration; in contrast to the Soviet Union, there exists a natural assimilation trend, under an ideology expressed by the metaphor melting pot. Under the strain of everyday life's necessities, the assumption in everybody's mind is that, with the adoption of English as the generally accepted spoken language, ethnic and national background as well as religious affiliations and such other differences (as spoken language at home) are irrelevant. Having said that, however, in terms of race relations, the image is not that rosy. The memories of a dismal past have not yet been dissipated. The wrath of legalized slavery as a social system is still a wound not yet totally forgotten or forgiven. The dispossession of the native Indians from their lands has not been redressed. The arrogance of the Anglo-Saxons has not been totally dispelled. However, with the immigration of Hispanics from south of the border, and Asiatics, including Koreans, Vietnamese, and Chinese, the balance between majority and minorities under an evolutionary process will be reversed. BACK TO OUR MAIN TOPIC After our examination of the different natures of multi-ethnic states, going back to our main topic, the discussions at the Conference marking the 75th Anniversary of the Treaty of Lausanne were bout how to resolve the ensuing problems. They were about their national aspirations expressed by demands for their independence, for rights of self-determination. The Convention signed between Greece and Turkey, which was an ancillary agreement to the Treaty of Lausanne, had as its objective the resolution of the problem of ethnic minorities within their respective territories, through an exchange of populations. And this is a study that would cover views about the result of this ethnic population exchange and its ramifications. First, at the initial stage of the exchange and, secondly, at the conclusion of the operations. In all the papers presented there was agreement about the intent, that is to bring an end to the multiethnic situations existing in both countries, henceforth creating racial homogeneity and national harmony. Inspired by the results, our objective is to examine whether such an exchange could also be agreed upon between Karabagh and Azerbaijan.","Touryantz, Hagop Jack",Armenian Reporter International,1999-03-06,0
"Istanbul Armenian Patriarch, in Radio Interview, Discusses Current Issues of Armenians in Turkey His Beatitude Archbishop Mesrop Mutafyan, the youthful new Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul, was interviewed by this reporter last Sunday on Armenian Radio Hour of New Jersey. The Patriarch was in the metropolitan area to visit His Holiness Karekin I, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, who is recovering in New York City from a recent medical operation. In the interview Archbishop Mutafyan discussed a number of substantive topics which included present-day Armenian life in Turkey, current issues relating to the Diaspora, and those of the Armenian Church in general. The Armenian Radio Hour of New Jersey can be heard every Sunday, 2-4 p.m. on WSOU 89.5 FM. What follows is the unedited transcript of the interview which this reporter had the pleasure and honor of conducting with His Beatitude Patriarch Mesrob. The Armenian segment of the interview, which is not represented below, focused on the Patriarch's visit to Vehapar, concerns of the Armenian Church and the community regarding Vehapar's health. Q. What is the current state of Armenians living in Istanbul? A. If, by current state, you mean the statistics - according to official statistics there are some 82,000 Armenians all over Turkey. However, that's not a very realistic figure - you have to subtract from that number 15,000-20,000 Armenians who are Turkish citizens and hold Turkish passports but who live in the Benelux countries and Germany. So, subtracting that number, you get a more realistic figure of around 60,000. Those are the official Armenians. Then you have many more thousands of people who are of Armenian descent but who are Turkish Muslims on their identity cards, especially in the Black Sea region in the eastern provinces of Anatolia. Of this number, some 20-30,000 read, write and speak Armenian fluently but the rest feel more comfortable in using Turkish - which is not peculiar to Turkey. We did not used to consider Turkey diaspora because of our deep roots and heritage and tradition; however, more and more, the Turkish Armenian community is showing signs of becoming a diasporan territory. [Furthermore], there are two daily papers [Marmara and Jamanak], which are published in Armenian with a circulation of some 2,000 copies a day. Then, there is the bilingual weekly, Agos, published in Turkish and Armenian, which has a circulation of over 5,000. The Lraper (Bulletin) of the Armenian Patriarchate, published weekly, sometimes fortnightly - also bilingual - has a circulation of around 8,000 and is distributed freely in the churches. Then, we also have some six monthly magazines - all in Armenian. There is a tendency to have new publications in simpler Armenian so that the youth will be attracted to reading these publications. Apart from these, we can add, the fact of Istanbul, governed by 33 parish councils, 19 schools - 15 of which are Armenian Apostolic, and 4 of them belonging to the Armenian Catholic community. We have 20 alumni associations, and 18 choir associations and tbrats tasses. Then the Sourp Prgich National Hospital in Yedikule. These are the main institutions we have in Istanbul. We have some small - altogether 16 communities in Anatolia - outside of Istanbul, the largest one being in Ankara and in historic Cilicia in the Adana and Hatay region. There are also worrisome figures we should talk about: According to baptismal and funerary records, the community is not getting larger or smaller, because the exodus to foreign countries has almost stopped. We even have some people returning to Istanbul. However, intermarriages are increasing - and the rate is as high as 50% today, mostly among the college students. Q. Could you also address the economic and social standing of Armenians living in Istanbul? It is often said that Armenians living in Istanbul are second-rate or second-class citizens. Could you comment please? A. Well, economically we don't have any more tycoons left in Istanbul. Most of our really wealthy people have left for foreign countries during the last three decades; however, there are some 40-50 well-to-do people who are bearing the responsibility of underwriting most of the expenses of our communal institutions in Istanbul. I wouldn't say as persons per se Armenian citizens in Turkey are second-rate or second-class citizens. They have before the law equal opportunity in almost everything. I said almost, because there are certain things, certain professions that Armenians are not allowed into. Although that is a silent arrangement. For example, they can not become commissioned officers in the army. They can not become police officers. But they can become politicians or parliamentarians, if they have the backing. They do become professors; they do become municipality officers. So as persons, as citizens of Turkey, they are not second-rate citizens. However, there are some problems, which we encounter as a community. So, Turkish citizens of Armenian descent, as persons, don't have a problem, but the Armenian community has some problems. But, again, that is not peculiar to Turkey. I would say that in every country that I know, there are minorities. And, in every country that I know, minorities have problems. And, so in Turkey too, not only Armenians, but also other minorities of every type, be they ethnic or religious minorities, do encounter problems - which the parliament has to work on. But, as a country that is going through a fast transitional period of course, usually the parliament is busy with the majority issues. And, when you have issues that 65 million people face in the country, you wouldn't expect the parliament to busy itself with the problems that 60,000 people face - to be pragmatic. However, I am happy to say that in the parliament, as well as council of ministers, there are commissions which are busying themselves with the problems of the minorities - and I am hopeful. As we face the year 2000 - the Great Jubilee - and as Turkey is approaching membership in the EU, some of the problems that we are facing today, which are residues of the first decades of the Turkish Republic and the formative period - residues from the one-party regime during the first half of the republic's history - I hope these issues of the community will be solved, one by one. I would like, as the religious head of the community, to be hopeful in this sense, I do see a spirit of cooperation in the political leadership of the country, the way they meet us, and the way they discuss problems with us, and I appreciate the openness. Q. Could you briefly elaborate on the kinds of problems the community faces with the leadership? A. For example, a decision which was made in 1936, which is a wrong interpretation of the Lausanne Treaty, claims that minorities cannot own any new property other than what they have at the time when the Lausanne Treaty was signed. As such, in 1936, the government asked the minorities to submit a list of all the properties they had, and the Armenian and other minority institutions did submit those lists. And, suddenly, in the late 1970's another government came and said, O.K., what you had submitted in 1936 is what you can own and anything else that you have received after then you have to return. This is a nonsensical decision that has to be, in some way, remedied. Another, again nonsensical thing is that to be a member of a church and to be able to elect and to be elected in a church assembly - you have to live in the quarter of that church - in the geographical quarter of that particular church building. In other words, you're not free to be an official member of a church in NJ if you live in NY. In other words, you can attend a religious service on a given Sunday if you want, you can drive from NY to NJ to that particular church, you can do so every Sunday, but when the time comes for parish elections you're not allowed to be a part of that parish assembly in the church you attend and in which you worship. Why? Because someone says, you live in NY and you have no right to be a part of the NJ church. Well, that's very untimely. That's not a modern approach to things. And, that's restrictive - it reminds you of the 1920-1930's in any country. It's not a modern way of dealing with elections. There are these kinds of problems that have to be dealt with. INTERMARRIAGES Q. You mentioned the 50% rate of intermarriages, and we've also have heard about schools being closed, churches shut down, enrollment in schools decreasing. How does this endanger the community? A. Well, as I said, the community is not diminishing in numbers - it is following a rather constant line right now; however, the culture is overwhelmingly Turkish. The TV is in Turkish; the higher education is in Turkish. Istanbul is a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society, although overwhelmingly Muslim and Turkish. And, whatever an Armenian child receives in an Armenian primary school setting is very easily washed away in a senior high school, in a foreign school, in a Turkish school, especially, in a college environment. And, where there are all sorts of different ethnic groups and cultural groups represented, intermarriage is a act, like in any other country in the Diaspora. And, only after intermarriage, do young people tend to think about what will happen to their children. Not before marriage, but after. And, unfortunately, many young people are not ready to seek pastoral counseling before they get married. So, we have some 50% intermarriages right now. According to the established norms in Turkey and in many other Middle Eastern countries, if the father of the child is Armenian, regardless of the ethnicity of the mother, the child is considered Armenian and, by law, is allowed to attend an Armenian minority school. But, if the mother is Armenian, and the father is of some other ethnic group, then, by law, the child cannot attend an Armenian minority school. So, you lose a person from your community and, in this case, we lose twice because if the father is Armenian and the mother is Turkish, usually half of the children from those intermarriage families come to our minority schools, and because the mother doesn't speak any Armenian, Whatever the child learns as a second language at school - Armenian - is not usable in the home. Then, if the father is not Armenian, the child cannot be enrolled in the Armenian school anyway, so we lose a lot of blood there. THE CHURCH Q. What role does the church play in the community and, as the 84th patriarch of Istanbul, what do you personally wish to attain for the community there? A. Well, the church is the foundation of the community. The church provides the main leadership of the community, and everything that is Armenian and Christian can only be found around the church and in the church. And, without the Patriarchate, and without the church in the Turkish Armenian community, you can not talk of any community at all. And Armenians know that. This is why I would say, whether it's good or bad, whenever you enter any home, you will find 50% of any conversation centering around the church and the Patriarchate. Although the Patriarchate is only a spiritual leadership and by law has no bearing on other institutions in the community, the people know the important role of the institution, and whatever the law and the regulations say, they feel themselves bound to and responsible before the Patriarchate. What I wish to attain during my tenure as the 84th Armenian Patriarch of this historic city is, first of all, the preserve the heritage, to preserve the rich treasures - the spiritual treasures that we have received from our forefathers - for the future generations. The Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul has, I would say, three important missions. First, the universal mission of preaching the gospel, preaching the Christian message. Secondly, to provide pastoral attention and care to Armenians living in Turkey and on the island of Crete, which is under our jurisdiction. Thirdly, as one of the hierarchical four Sees of the Armenian Church, we have a responsibility in wider Armenian affairs, including Armenian Church affairs. So, we intend to keep the Istanbul Patriarchal See as an active center, which pays attention to all of these duties that have been handed down to us by our predecessors. Q. You used to be considered a controversial leader by the Turkish government. How do you feel about that? And, how are you seen today? A. Well, the Turkish government has never said anywhere that I am viewed as a controversial person. We have read this kind of material, only in ultranationalistic Turkish papers like Turkiye, Ortadough, and Hergun and one TV channel called TGRT. But, we have also found out that most of this material was pumped to these newspapers and particularly to that TV station by Armenian dissidents in the community who were in charge of certain councils where there were controversial ways of handling church property. And, those dissidents were also the ones who were quite apprehensive about my election. They did not want to see, I presume, a more dynamic or energetic, younger leader who would poke his nose into what was going on in certain corners of the community. So, they wanted to use their connections here and there is the Turkish government. And, they were successful in delaying the elections. But, again, it was the Turkish government - the chief leaders in the Turkish government - who solved the problem and overrode the impasse and allowed the elections by declaring that it was not in the interest of the Turkish government to hinder these elections. And, that the Armenian community, according to its own traditions, in a democratic way, would elect the religious leader of their choice, and whoever they elected would also be accepted by the Turkish government as the Armenian Patriarch of Turkey. To that effect, His Excellencies Suleyman Demirel, the president of Turkey, and also the President of the Turkish national government, Mr. Hitmet Cetin, both sent open messages to the Armenian community a couple of days before the elections, which were published in our two dailies and our Agos weekly. So, the Armenian community members, with a free conscience, could go to the polls and elect their leader - and they did. And, all the uproar before the elections and the delay in the election only caused more people to vote - and, for the first time in the history of the Turkish Republic, we had 16,000 people going to the ballot boxes to vote for an Armenian Patriarch. THOUGHTS ON JERUSALEM Q. What is your reaction to your recent trip to Jerusalem? Did you achieve what you had hoped to achieve? Of course, I did my graduate studies in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in the American Institute, which is now called Jerusalem University College. So, I have a special connection to the Holy City. Since Vehapar was in America for his operation, I decided to pay my first patriarchal visit to the Holy City, for quite a few important reasons. First of all, it is a city that is holy to three monotheistic religions, and within only 11 months' time we shall celebrate the Grand Jubilee - the 2000th anniversary of the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whose city was Jerusalem. And again this era is the era of multifaith and multi-ethnic and pluralistic societies and dialogue - a dialogue of life between people, dialogue of faiths, dialogue of cultures, dialogue of nations, instead of the clash between civilizations. And, Jerusalem is a wonderful place for that. It's a city rich in symbolism. On a different note, the Patriarchs of Jerusalem and Istanbul, unfortunately, during the last 4 or 5 decades did not have very good relations because of many reasons. On the other hand, in the 18th century, the relations between the two patriarchies were very cordial, which also proved to be a blessing for the whole Armenian Church at the time. So, I also wished to re-establish the good ties between the two patriarchal sees, and wanted to visit His Beatitude Archbishop Torkom as my senior brother. He also received me in a very cordial manner and, as far as we know, for the first time in history, the Patriarchs of Istanbul and Jerusalem celebrated Christmas together in Bethlehem in anticipation of the year 2000. So, all of this was realized during this one visit. I also visited the other religious leaders of Jerusalem and all of these high level interreligious dialogue meetings were blessed with success. I think that the reasons for which I visited Jerusalem were justified, and I am very happy that my first official visit as a Patriarch overseas was blessed with success. Now, my second official visit will be to Etchmiadzin, when Vehapar returns to his See. Only afterwards, I believe, will I begin visiting some of the dioceses in the Diaspora, when Primates extend invitations. Q. From what you witnessed in Jerusalem, could you compare and contrast the two communities - the Armenian community of Jerusalem and that of Istanbul? A. Yes, first of all, the Armenian community of Jerusalem is of course very small. Less than 25000 people in all of Israel, but, I would say, they are divided into three different political parties - different clubs, different agoumps, but it's at least good that they have one school in which they all study. What was a source of happiness for me was that almost all of the young people speak Armenian. Jerusalem is a community with four languages because almost everybody speaks Armenian, English, Arabic and Hebrew to get by. I'm always shocked when I go to Jerusalem because I don't see any popular pietism in a city that is holy for all Christians and other religions. You don't see Jerusalem Armenians in the church - even on the occasions of high feasts in the church calendar - compared to the Syrian Orthodox community, for example, who are present in the liturgies with almost all the members of the community. As during the patriarchal entrance to the Church of Nativity in Bethlehem, apart from the 50 Istanbul Armenian pilgrims who went there with us, I could count only about 15 Jerusalem Armenians. And, I was shocked. I was shocked. On the other hand, Istanbul, traditionally, is a city that is unique not only in the Middle East, but all of the Diaspora; it is the only place where there is an ecole of pieties. People may be not so informed in classical Armenian or church history, maybe even the holy scriptures; however - whether they are native Istanbulians, or from the provinces in the East, whether they are Armenian-speaking people, or simply Turkish speakers who don't understand a word of Armenian - you will see that, especially in the central parishes, the churches are full, even on a simple Sunday. A regular Sunday - not high feast day. For example, during this period of Great Lent, not only on Sundays, but every single day the churches will be full to the street gates for the services of Arevakal and Hsgoom. You can't see that in Armenia, you can't see that anywhere else in the Diaspora. So, that's a peculiarity of Istanbul, which is not a holy city, which is not holy for three monotheistic religions, where the community is not speaking four languages, but just one - Turkish and some Armenian - but the strength and the spiritually of the church is at the highest. And, I think that has to be studied as to why it's that way. I presume, coming from the depth of history, social-psychological reasons, and also the fact that the great scholars and great preachers of the Armache Ecole (Armash School) who had a great impact on the spirituality of the community a hundred years ago. Also, the fact that in the Diaspora it is mostly Istanbul Armenians who are serving in the churches in America and in Europe,- tbrats tasses, the choirs, diratzous, in the churches are mainly Armenians from Istanbul. You get more recruits in these groups from Istanbul. There must be a reason behind it; there must be an explanation. I think that it is the impact that the Armache leaders, the preachers, the teachers of doctrines made on the community in the beginning of the century. PATRIARCH'S MESSAGE Q. In closing, what is your message to our community? A. First, I like to ask you all to forgive me for sounding so monotonous - I am still experiencing an extreme jet lag. To the community at large, I would like to extend my best wishes for their family life, for their community life. I would advise them to reap the benefits of living in this blessed and free country. On the one hand, to prosper, to have blessed, large, nice families; on the one hand, to prosper, to have blessed, large, nice families; on the other hand, I would ask them to pay full allegiance to their heritage, to what has been handed down from our forefathers - the spiritual wealth, the moral strength - which is embodied in our Church today. There are many Christian churches in this country, there are many ways of worship, and there are many ways of approaching the Bible. But what is Armenian - what has been handed down to us by the Armenian monks, by our Armenian fathers of the past - is for us, is ours, and if we stop experiencing, if we stop patronizing this heritage, no one else will. This is a language; this is a Churchill this a tradition; this is a culture that is ours. And an Englishman, a Frenchman, a Turk, an Arab, a Jew, with due respect to all of them, will not keep our heritage, will not adhere to our Church, will not live according to our tradition. It is us, and us only, who can keep these things going. So, I would ask, especially the new generation, to have a feeling of belonging to these values, and not to keep these values only as something they have to carry along with them by a mandate, because they have to, but I would ask them to experience deeply the spirituality of these values. Let them be like the air they breathe in and out, let them be like the blood that circulates in their veins, and this way they will be able to live them out as naturally as possible and to extend them to the next generation - their children. I pray and wish that this will be made possible in their lives. Photo (Talar Sesetyan interviewing His Beatitude Abp. Mesrob Mutafyan.)","Sesetyan, Talar",Armenian Reporter International,1999-03-06,0
"GREEK SCHOLAR PUBLISHES THREE-VOLUME STUDY OF PROPHESY It is worthy to spotlight a three-volume prophetic study by Greek scholar, economist, teacher, and poet Helen Tzima Otto, Ph.D., as she writes abut events that could transpire in the coming years in countries surrounding Armenia. From the index of the first volume, we notice that Armenia and Armenians are mentioned on some 20 pages, while Turkey is mentioned on 36 pages. Having been born and raised in Greece of Greek Orthodox faith, the author has a close understanding of the plight and sufferings of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks (of whom even Pope Calixtus III is cited as saying: From the Devil, the Turk and the Comet, Good Lord deliver us.) Helen writes in the first volume about the atrocities committed by the Turks against both the Armenians and the Greeks. However, her work is mainly prophetic. She has done a very exhaustive study (Helen reads eight languages and travels a lot) of old and new prophecies from various sources which include Hebrew, Catholic, Orthodox, Russian and Greek prophecies and from Nostradamus to Edgar Cayce. She points that almost all the prophecies agree in one point, namely that Turkey will be crucial in starting a great war to engulf first the Greek peninsula, then Yugoslavia, Macedonia and Albania; while the Muslim Arabs will attack southern Italy, France and Spain. Helen mentions that all the prophecies agree that the Turks and the Arabs will be utterly defeated and the city of Constantinople will at last be liberated by the Russians. In the final count, one third of the Turks will be killed, one third will convert to Christianity, and one third will be expelled into Central Asia, their original homeland. A small detail worthy of mention: The Russians have become alarmed even since December 1991 when the Central Asian leaders had a conference in Alma Ata for the creation of a Great Turan destined to stretch from the Peninsula of Anatolia to the Djungarskii Altai mountains (as mentioned on page 6 of volume 2). And, clearly, the Turkish leader Tansu Ciller was echoing that conference when she said: Beware! Turkey is coming with its 60 million people, and behind them the 200 million Turkish-speaking people. As a confirmation, Helen Otto writes: Turkey, which joined the Western bloc during the Cold-War era, has learned the secrets of modern warfare and high-tech mass annihilation. With this know-how, they are now ready to turn to their true enemy... This 3-volume work is a must read for anyone interested in prophecies and it could be an enlightening experience for anyone who loves to read. As for me, myself being the author of a prophetic book about the coming World War III, I honestly could not put her books down since receiving them recently.

"Warrant for Genocide New Book By Prof. Vahakn Dadrian on the Armenian Genocide Warrant for Genocide By Prof. Vahakn N. Dadrian, Transaction Publishers, Dept 980 FVND, 390 Campus Drive Somerset, NJ 08873. (888) 999-6778. The academic publishing house Transaction, affiliated with Rutgers University, just released in this country as well as in England, genocide scholar Prof. Vahakn Dadrian's new book titled, Warrant For Genocide: Key Elements of Turko-Armenian Conflict. In the commentary printed on the dust jacket of the book, the publishers emphasize the fact that in the new work Dadrian analyzes the Armenian Genocide form a new perspective. Central to that perspective is the reliance on an interdisciplinary approach combining knowledge from the fields of history, political science, international law and demography. This book has am introduction, twelve chapters and an extensive Appendix in which the prominent Turkish-American historian and demographer Kemal Karpat and revisionist-denier Justin McCarthy are taken to task for mishandling statistics on the Ottoman Armenian population. Moreover, the book has an extensive multi-language bibliography and two separate indexes, subject and name. Among the several new topics explored in this new volume are the pivotal role of the Kurds in the decimation and ultimate destruction of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire, especially in the provinces of Diyarbekir, Harput, Erzerum, Bitlis and Van. Another chapter explores the series of failures of the peaceful Armenian reform movement and its evolution into a revolutionary movement out of frustration and despair. In Chapter 9, Prof. Dadrian, for the first time, provides details on the secret decisions of the Young Turk Ittihadists to abandon their trumpeted goal of establishing a harmonious multiethnic Ottoman state and revert to atavism in order to homogenize the country by purging the empire's non-Muslim minorities. Utilizing British, French, German and Austrian archival material, Dadrian exposes Talaat's August 6, 1910 conspiratorial speech before a top-secret Ittithadist conclave in Saloniki. In that speech Talaat denounces the idea of equality for the non-Muslim whom he pejoratively calls infidels (gaiour) and outlines his plan of taking over the reins of the country by coopting the army and expanding in the provinces the network of party cells and branches. Perhaps, the most revealing part of the speech is Tallat's plan to work out conspiratorial schemes which, he averred, should be kept secret even from the regular officials and functionaries of the Ottoman State, a clear indication of the sinister plans in their embryonic stage. By further probing into these European State documents, Dadrian singles out the 1910 annual Ittihad Party Convention as the turning point for Ittihad, the empire and the Armenians. He shows that apart from and beyond the formal sessions of the party, a small clique of Ittihadist potentates carried out highly secret deliberations about future designs vis-a-vis the non-Muslim subject nationalities with a view to liquidation them by all means available, including resort to massacres. Chapter 10 brings into light another aspect of the Turko-Armenian conflict that has hitherto remained unexplored in terms of its bearing on the Genocide. It deals with the military role Armenians played in the 1912 Balkan War and in World War I. Dadrian, with painstaking detail, outlines the heroic deeds of Armenian military units in both wars, simultaneously fighting in the ranks of the Ottoman Army and in the armies counterposed to that army. We learn for the first time that the confluence of three major battles, which the Turks lost disastrously and which Armenians were perceived by the Turks to have played a major negative role, became the final catalyst for the enactment of the Armenian Genocide. These were the battles of Sarikamish (Winner 1914-15), Dilman (April-May, 1915) and the Van uprising (April-May 1915). In this connection, Prof. Dadrian provides fascinating new details about an Armenian lieutenant from Sivas whose heroic deeds in the Sarikamish battle seemingly saved the life of War Minister and Ittihadist warlord Enver Pasha. In Chapter 11, the Armenian scholar illuminates some of the hitherto dark features of the May 14/27, 1915 Law on Deportation in the publication and discussion of which Turkish authorities and historians continue to leave out a critical portion of the memorandum Talaat appended to his draft proposal for the enactment of the Law of Deportation. That proposal on May 13/26 was formally submitted to Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha and his Cabinet for approval. Two additional chapters are striking for innovative thinking and new documentation. Chapter 7 explains why Zeitun escaped the horrors of the Abdul Hamit era massacres as the epic heroism of the highlanders of the Eagle's Nest is contrasted with the defenselessness of almost the entire Ottoman Armenian population, many of whom were mercilessly slaughtered and decimated in the 1894-96 period. Perhaps the book's most valuable part is the final Chapter 12, in which three major factions are depicted as The Arch Determinants of the Turk Armenian Conflict and its Violent Resolution. It is a compact and powerful recapitulation of his major theses that focuses on Theocracy, Demography and Power Relations. Under Demography, Dadrian, as far as it is known, for the first time discusses the critical aspect of population statistics in terms of a resolute Ottoman initiative to continuously gerrymander provincial boundaries with the intent to reduce Armenian majorities and pluralities to district numerical minorities. This process of manipulative redistricting is examined in minute detail specifying the place names, the districts and counties. In this connection, Dadrian also examines in great detail the uninterrupted flow of migrations by Muslim refugees (muhacirs) form the Balkans and the Caucasus and their deliberate resettlement by Ottoman authorities in and around Armenian population cluster. The lethal role of these enraged refugees, full of hatred and revenge against Christians, is highlighted in Dadrian's description of the organization of the Armenian Genocide by Talaat and Ittihad's Central Committee. The book is written with Dadrian's traditional style which reflects an economy of words, compactness and lucidity, and has an abundance of references and sources substantiating the specifics of the text. Undoubtedly, this is a new and powerful weapon in the arsenal of Prof. Dadrian who single-handedly works to oppose the virulent campaign of Turkish denials.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1999-02-06,0
"Armenians and Czechs: Facing the Challenges of Freedom It has been almost a decade since Armenians and Czechs turned their back on communism and the socialist system. Today these nations are face with the challenges and responsibilities of freedom. This factor came to the forefront on my recent speaking trip to the universities, seminaries and churches in these two countries separated from each other by a few thousand miles. This was my third visit to these two nations covering a span of three decades. My previous visit were during their communist period. This third visit in October 1988 was the most satisfying of all my trips to the Czech Republic and the Republic of Armenia. With the honeymoon of freedom now behind them, Armenians and Czechs are waking up to the long-term accountabilities expected of a free people faced with the benefits and frustrations of democracy. SIMILAR NATIONAL EXPERIENCE Each of the countries was previously subjected to a centralized (and, in practice, totalitarian) governance; their recent experience of freedom has been exhilarating and harmful at the same time. Czechs as well as Armenians are exercising their freedom at times irresponsibly. It is reported that crime has increased in both countries since the demise of communism. The Russian Mafia is not limited to Russia. Some have not yet discovered that freedom does not mean license to do as one pleases, namely, ignoring rules and regulations. As a consequence, citizens as well as government officials are reportedly circumventing and abusing laws of their respective countries. That is the practice of bribery in these post-communist countries; of course, we in the West are not exempt from such practices as well. But there is apparently less enforcement of the rules today than found during their communist period. What is truly sad is the widespread attitude in these post-communist societies that accepts dishonesty as a necessary means to assure survival. There are far too many citizens who feel insecure in the midst of their newfound freedom without having the safety nets of the past. I wonder if we could feel differently in the face of rising unemployment, inflation, and low salaries. Those who regularly cut corners see it as essential for personal survival. This situation is probably more evidence in Armenia with its more austere economy than in the Czech Republic. In Armenia, a far greater percentage of the people are unemployed (we heard figures of 40 to 60 percent and even higher) whereas unemployment in the Czech Republic is currently financial recession. Most citizens in these two countries are underpaid for their abilities and educational level. FIRST WORLD VS. THIRD WORLD While both of these countries are post-communist, the difference between them can be contrasted as first world vs. third world in observing their respective stages of development. The Czechs are the first world; they have had a jump start over the Armenians in their financial recovery and have had a shorter history of dealing with communism. Under the leadership of Thomas A. Masaryk, their first president in 1918, the Czechs were given a greater exposure to democracy than Armenians. Armenians and Czechs can both boast of high literacy amount their population. Progress, however, has been slower for Armenians due to the devastating earthquake of 1988 and the Nagorna-Karabagh War of recent years, dealing devastating blows to Armenia's development. Armenians need to recover their earlier industrial capacity as well as the lost markets for their goods. Nevertheless, hope continues to exit. In 2001 Armenians will celebrate seventeen hundred years of Christianity. King Tirdat III converted to Christianity in 301 A.D., and Armenians are proud of the fact that their country is the oldest Christian nation in the world, even before Emperor Constantine's conversion in Rome to Christianity in 312 A.D. The Christian heritage of Armenia has give its people a persistence of hope. In spite of her distinctive heritage, Armenia is a land-locked nation and isolated religiously from other nations who share her Christian heritage. Armenia had always been the most eastern, border of Christendom in early times and consequently has undergone persecution for her convictions for centuries. The most recent struggle for her identity was seen in the Nagorno-Karabagh territorial dispute with Azerbaijan. Over 95% of the population in this area are Armenians who found their communities threatened by the Muslim mobs of Azeris who attacked their city of Sumgait in February of 1998. Today there is a truce between Armenia and Azerbaijan, but a final treaty and resolution of all issues is till pending. Armenia's closest non-Islamic neighbor is the Republic of Georgia. In spite of its largely hostile environment, Armenians have prided themselves on their tenacity to survive, nurtured by their faith and cultural achievements. SURVIVAL MENTALITY It is this very survival mentality among Armenians that gives them permission (some feel) to take liberties with matters of law and order when necessary, undermining thereby the very democratic freedom they achieved in 1991. Today's citizens are disappointed with their material status. Many said to me that under communism they had more money but a limited choice of goods to purchase; today, except for an elite minority who have profiled from the turn-around, they have increased the goods but little money. This leaves a growing number among the populace doubting the new democracy that governs them. Czechs, like Armenians, also find themselves in a small landlocked nation surrounded by larger friendly in recognizing and respecting Czech nationality. As a consequence, the Czech have always looked to the West for their support of freedom and democracy; but unfortunately, encouragement from the West has not always been consistent and forthcoming. After the recent advent of political freedom with the Velvet Revolution of 1989, most Czechs are in a hurry to catch up with what they have missed since communism came to their borders in 1948 following World War II. While Czechs have ambivalent feelings toward Germany, the prosperity and intellectual accomplishments of Germans serve as models for Czechs in their wish to go forward. Czechs desire to be seen as the economic miracle in Central Europe in their transition from communism to a market-driven economy. GAP BETWEEN HAVENS & HAVE-NOTES Soon, along with Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and Estonia, the Czechs would like to be the first among the Eastern Bloc nations to join the European Union and achieve worldwide recognition by a year or two (the target date had been 2003). I have no doubt that the Czechs will achieve their financial goals, Armenia, I'm afraid, will lag far behind the Czechs in reaching similar goals. Perhaps one sign of the widening gap between haves and have-notes among the post-communist societies is the fact that McDonald's hamburgers has yet to come to Armenia; while the Czech Republic is saturated with McDonald's will eventually make it to Armenia, but they may be surprised to find that Armenian creativity will franchise their delicious Armenian kebobs. Perhaps these Kebobs will be featured on future McDonald's menus, along with their well-known hamburgers. At a deeper level, Armenians and Czechs need to strive more consciously to strengthen their moral heritage which can be helpful in the development of democratic societies. These countries will also learn, as we have in the West, that moral values can never be taken for granted. Maintenance of these values calls for constant vigilance. Actually, in a broader sense, there is a growing need to implement a global ethic within today's global economy. How else can we keep human life human? The quality of integrity in any society, East, West, North or South, is constantly under, from my standpoint, can be a significant source to strengthen moral behavior among nations who face the many challenge of freedom in a market-driven world. STATE CHURCH Czech and Armenians see themselves as religious people; in fact the state church for Czechs, for all practical purposes, is the dominant presence of the Roman Catholic Church. Force Armenians it is the Armenians Apostolic (orthodox) Church which claims a 90% following of the population. There are also Protestants in these countries who play a smaller but nevertheless significant role as well. All these church traditions need to work together ecumenically to mount a well-planned program of moral education for their societies. Such an ecumenical effort must avoid being self-righteous in tone or authoritarian in outlook. Such attitudes would undermine the democratic development we seek to nurture. A true democracy requires space for creativity and encouragement for the individual conscience to express itself freely. One of the remaining challenges facing Czechs and Armenians is how far do they wish to truly distance themselves from their new freedom. I suspect that many of us in the West are not fully aware of the enormous cost and personal pain citizens of these post-communist countries have experienced and continue to undergo as they work through their present transformation toward democratic capitalism. There are many in these post-communist nations who continue to labor under the illusion that the rewards for entering a free society should have come more easily and quicker than they have experienced. Abandoning this disappointing illusion and facing the realities of their present austerity have not been easy for Czechs and Armenians. An increasing number are wondering if the high cost of freedom so essential to a market-driven society is really worth it. Answering this concern realistically and honestly ought to be given more attention by policy makers as the revolution to a market society approaches its tenth anniversary. MUTUAL NEED Perhaps these two landlocked nationalities, Czechs and Armenians, even though separated as they are by distance, will discover, I hope, how much they need each other. Each has a history of suffering as well as tenacity to resist that is admirable. As they both strive to become successful in a market-driven world, hopefully they will find it beneficial to do business together and also to assist each other in their common mission to enhance the quality of life for their people. We in the West cannot afford to neglect these post-communist nations economically and politically; perhaps even more important we will demonstrate through our own successes and shortcomings that all gain is in vain if we neglect the moral foundations of freedom directing us to keep human life human through faith, hope and love.","Calian, Carnegie Samuel",Armenian Reporter International,1999-01-16,0
"The Uses of Bribery Russia and the Armenians of Transcaucasia, 1797-1889. By George A. Bournoutian. A documentary record, annotated translation and commentary, 578 pp. Costa mesa, CA: Mazda. $49.95. I 56859 068 7. This valuable and well-written book is a collection of the most important references to the Armenians found in Persian, Russian, Georgian and Ottoman diplomatic records for the crucial years 1797-1889. It was during this time that the Russian Empire extended its grasp to the Caucasus and Sub-Caucasus, gaining control, of Georgia, Daghestan, Armenia and Azerbaijian. These fertile lands had been held alternately by the Ottoman Turks and the Persians, two Muslim nations whose rule over the Christian Georgians and Armenians was never pleasant and always resented. The Georgians did not necessarily welcome the Christian Russians, for they would have preferred independence; the Armenians, though, who had no king, made it clear to the Russians that a union would be beneficial for them both. The spread of Russian power over the Caucasus is not particularly well understood by historians. Though we know fairly well how the Russians gained control of Central Asia, a land that seems to fit into the romantic imagination of the Westerner, being the northern gate to India, the early history of Georgia, Armenia, Daghestan and Azerbaijian is not only less glamorous, but is arguably much more complicated; according, it is not as well researched. As Russian power went deeper into the Caucasus, there was concern how these oriental provinces should be ruled. The centralists favoured all administration being in the hands of Russians, for the sake of uniformity. The regionalists wanted less Russification and a greater voice for the semi-tribal people whom they had overpowered. Tsar Nicholas I, in 1840, tried a wholly Russifying approach, but it proved unworkable. For one thing, it seemed to accelerate nationalistic feelings. Thus, as we read in these documents, the Russians found that a light but steady hand allowed their rule to continue in Armenia without significant problems. One also notes that the Russian rulers of Caucasia are usually superior people. Their correspondence is disciplined and almost always courteous. It is only during the rule of a centralist bureaucrat that we see a heavy hand. Increasingly, and assuredly for its age, the Russian rule was surprisingly enlightened. Certainly, the Armenians developed a greater national cohesiveness under Russian rule, and achieved greater prosperity than those Armenians who lived under Ottoman rule. The Armenians, who have had no king since 1375, had to rely for leadership on their Church, their only national symbol. Under Russian rule, the Armenian Church, which had earlier become notably corrupt, reformed itself by improving education of its clergy, becoming a less avaricious, and more consistent in its administration. So, Armenia benefitted and accepted Russian power more willingly than the Georgians. This has to prove true in Soviet times as well, for during the sixty-eight years of Soviet power. Armenia flourished as never before in education, standards of living and national security. The infamous Turkish atrocities, which began in the late nineteenth century, usually affected only Ottoman Armenians. Taxation under the Turks and the Persians had been excessive. The Russians, though zealous in collecting taxes, were governed by law. General Paskevich, who participated in the Russo-Persian wards and forced the Persians to sign the historic Treaty of Turkmanchay (1828), which brought an end to Persian power in the Caucasus, was careful about taxation, and signed documents (in 1829) prohibiting, for instance, the taxation of Armenian monasteries unless they received income from state land as well as from their own church land. There are some insights into the situation in Karabakh, but their value is limited, because the discussion is mostly about the whole of Karabakh, and not just the mountainous area in the western part of that territory which the Armenians claim. This limited area, even under Persin or Turkish control, retained a majority of Armenians. A Russian document from 1798 records baldly that the region under the rule of the Armenians is called Karabakh. Yet ten years later we read that the Armenians lost this sovereignty, and they petitioned Tsar Paul to help them get it back. So, it is also clear that - even though the Armenians were a majority in western Karabakh, they did not always rule. This Armenian presence in Mountainous Karabakh goes back to at least the seventh century, for in an Armenian gramma book written at this time by Stephen Siwnetsi, we read of a particular dialect of Armenian which was then spoken there, implying a lengthy settlement. That these Karabakh Armenians have been isolated from mainstream Armenian culture is clear, since their present dialect and sub-dialects retain the most unusual of all forms of Armenian speech and are largely incomprehensible to outsiders. The diplomatic passages in Russia and the Armenians of Transcaucasia make compelling reading, and because of the way they are arranged by Bournoutian, they develop and flow as logically as any composite historical text. Whether it is the good quality of Bournoutian's translation or the fact that the administrators of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries wrote well, this lengthy text moves swiftly. It is accompanied by a historical survey of this period in question, a number of indexes and some very good maps compiled by Robert H. Hewsen.","Greppin, John A.C",Armenian Reporter International,1999-01-02,0
"1998: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; Our Churches; good news, and bad Inter-confessional and intra-confessional conflicts, and even violence, which were evident during the late 1980s and early 1990s, all but disappeared as Ukraine entered its seventh year of independence. The U.S. State Department's annual human rights report, released in January, notes that 1997, like 1996, was basically stable in Ukraine in the sphere of religious activity, except for occasional incidents of religious conflict on an individual basis. The report does criticize the government for onerous registration and reporting requirements mandatory for religious organizations, especially for those defined as non-traditional, that is, Protestant. Various Ukrainian, Russian and Western sources cite the growing phenomenon of Protestant churches in Ukraine, a traditionally Orthodox country in which the Orthodox faithful remain split in their loyalties to Ukrainian patriarchs and the Moscow patriarch. Religious property issues, a topic of much heated debate between government authorities and religious groups, as well as between confessions, have subsided. In fact, 1998 was notable for the amount of renovation and new construction on religious buildings, both in the diaspora and in Ukraine. (See Kyiv reconstructs ancient treasures and Survey on culture and the arts.) At a roundtable held at the Embassy of Ukraine in Washington on January 15, the chief rabbi of Ukraine, Yaakov Bleich, stated that the Jewish community is faring better in Ukraine than in any of the other of the new independent countries of the region. However, he also warned that the welfare of Jews is tied to the general welfare of Ukraine. He stated that though there was no official, or government-supported anti-Semitism, there are numerous anti-Semitic incidents and publication of anti-Semitic articles, most notably in certain newspapers in western Ukraine. He noted the satisfactory resolution of the issues of the Brodsky synagogue in Kyiv and the Jewish cemetery in Lviv. In an interview with Mustafa Jemilev, the political leader of the Crimean Tatars, who are returning to the Crimean peninsula after having been deported to Central Asia by Stalin after the second world war, the main problems facing the Muslim Tatars are economic and political, including the issue of Ukrainian citizenship, and not religious issues. Orthodox Church In the diaspora, there was increased tension within the Orthodox Church this year. The 1995 decision by the hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. to accept the omophorion (protection) of the Patriarchate of Constantinople continued to cause tension among the parishes and faithful in America, many of whom do not support the decision to accept the jurisdiction of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. Several parishes threatened to leave the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. and on May 29, the Kyiv Patriarchate under the leadership of Patriarch Filaret accepted four U.S. parishes under its jurisdiction, a decision that received harsh criticism from the hierarchs in the U.S. On May 27, Patriarch Bartholomew arrived in Canada for a pastoral visit (he had visited the U.S. in the fall of 1997). Ukrainian Orthodox, along other Orthodox faithful in Canada, hosted the patriarch in Winnipeg, on the campus of St. Andrew's College and at the Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. The event helped mark the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Canada. The UOC-Canada accepted the omophorion of the ecumenical patriarch in 1990. The Sobor of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A., held October 13-19 at the Consistory in South Bound Brook, N.J., -- which began with apprehension over the issues of Constantinople, proposed changes to the Church Constitution and the prospect of additional parishes leaving -- ended in an uneasy calm as the changes to the Constitution were postponed and the Sobor accepted three resolutions: to contact the ecumenical patriarch with a request for written clarification of the relationship between Constantinople and the UOC-U.S.A., including commitment to an Autocephalous Church in Ukraine as the Mother Church for all Orthodox Ukrainians; to continue discussions with both Patriarchs Filaret and Dymytrii about Church unity in Ukraine; and, to confirm that only the ecumenical patriarch can grant autocephaly to a Church in Ukraine and that the Church in the U.S. will never belong to any Church controlled or influenced by Moscow. Metropolitan Constantine of the UOC-U.S.A. stated during the Sobor that if there is an independent, united autocephalous Orthodox Church in Ukraine, one that is not controlled by Moscow, then the UOC-U.S.A. will go under the omophorion of the patriarch in Kyiv, one that is recognized by the ecumenical patriarch. This position reassured many Sobor delegates. In accordance with the second motion, hierarchs of the UOC-U.S.A. met with Patriarch Filaret on October 23, shortly after his arrival in New York. The patriarch traveled to several cities on a pastoral visit to his parishes during his three weeks in the U.S. Catholic Church Pope John Paul II on April 6 granted the title of venerable to Josaphata Hordachevska, co-founder of the Sister Servants of Mary Immaculate. Sister Josaphata is the first Ukrainian woman to be going through the process of beatification-canonization. Also, in April, a letter from Cardinal Angelo Sodano in Rome to the bishops of Poland stated that married clergy could not serve in Poland, and that all married Byzantine-Ukrainian Rite clergy should return to their diocese of origin in Ukraine, though many had no such diocese and were Polish citizens. This letter caught most Ukrainian Catholic Church hierarchs offguard and to many observers, appeared like a throwback to the dark days prior to Vatican II. The letter was immediately criticized by representatives of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in Ukraine and in the West, as well as by Latin Rite bishops, including the bishops' conference in Australia, and Asia, as well as those attending an ecumenical conference in Washington in June. Cardinal Sodano made a trip to Kyiv in June where he met with Greek-Catholic hierarchs. Though no official response revoking the letter has come from Rome, the issue appears to have subsided. During the weeks of August 23 through September 10, both a Sobor and Synod of the Ukrainian Catholic Church were held in Lviv, the metropolitan see of the Church in Ukraine. The Sobor discussed the role of the faithful in the Church and prepared a final document for publication later this year. The Sobor is an advisory body to the Church hierarchs composed of laity and clergy; and this was the second conclave of several planned over five years. The Synod of Bishops discussed the role of the Ukrainian Catholic Church within the Universal Church. Both bodies announced preparations for celebrations of the second millennium of Christianity. In Canada, the Eparchy of Toronto, which celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, saw the installation of Bishop Cornelius Pasichny on September 24 as its new eparch. His appointment ended a nine-year standoff with the Vatican, which began when Bishop Isidore Borecky refused to resign in 1984, after he was requested to do so by Pope John Paul II. Present at Bishop Pasichny's installation were representatives from the Vatican, as well as Bishop Borecky, who had agreed to retire. Bishop Roman Danylak, who had been in dispute with Bishop Borecky, was given a new assignment in Rome. Cardinal Edward I. Cassidy, who is the head of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, called for the resumption of Catholic-Orthodox dialogue, a program that had been suspended in 1990. He cited the 1995 apostolic letter on Christian unity by Pope John Paul II. The resumption was announced at a conference in Washington on June 9-12, Orientale Lumen II, where relations between Churches and confessions were discussed, including a discussion of the Vatican letter that banned married Byzantine Rite priests from serving in Poland. Cardinal Cassidy, who stated that he had no prior knowledge of Cardinal Sodano's letter to the Polish bishops, suggested that the American bishops change their position (which, since 1929, bans the ordination of married men in the U.S.) as an example for Poland to follow. In November Bishop Lubomyr Husar, who has assumed the daily responsibilities for the primate of the Church, Cardinal Myroslav Ivan Lubachivsky, confirmed that discussions between the government of Ukraine and the Vatican are under way to plan a papal visit to Ukraine, possibly for late 1999. Other notables More than 6,000 pilgrims received sacraments this year during the Feast of the Dormition during their pilgrimage to visit the icon of the Mother of God of Zarvanytsia in western Ukraine. The sisters of St. Basil the Great held groundbreaking ceremonies for the new Holy Trinity Chapel and Basilian Spiritual Center in Fox Chase Manor, Pa., on May 10. Archbishop Antony, head of the Consistory of the UOC-U.S.A., celebrated 25 years of priesthood on January 17. Cardinal Agostino Casaroli, widely considered to be the architect of the Holy See's policy of rapprochement with the Communist East, as well as a supporter of Catholics living under repressive Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, including the underground Ukrainian Catholic Church, died during the week of June 7 in Rome at the age of 83. On May 17, the UOC-U.S.A. commemorated the 100th anniversary of the birth of Patriarch Mstyslav, and the fifth anniversary of his death with a daylong commemoration at the Church's Consistory. At the UOC-U.S.A. Sobor in October, it was announced that Bishop Vsevolod had been elevated to archbishop. Sister Augustine, 93, who entered the convent of the Basilian Sisters in 1923, on August 28, celebrated 75 years of service to the Ukrainian Catholic Church.

"UACC convention panel discusses diaspora in the 21st century by Marianna Liss Special to The Ukrainian Weekly WARREN, Mich. -- Among the highlights of the fourth convention of the Ukrainian American Coordinating Council was the panel discussion on The Ukrainian Diaspora in the 21st Century. Panelists were: Dr. Mykola Hryhorczuk of Detroit, a professor at Wayne State University and member of the Ukrainian Society of Philatelists and Numismatics; Jaroslav M. Berezowsky, a Michigan attorney who is active in the local Ukrainian school system; Nadia Komarnycky McConnell, president of the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation; and journalist R.L. Chomiak. With the declaration of Ukrainian independence, some people in our community thought their duty toward the struggle for Ukrainian independence had fallen from their shoulders, ... Unfortunately, the situation is not that simple, began Dr. Hryhorczuk. Since Ukraine's independence and sovereignty are not assured, the task facing the Ukrainian community outside Ukraine is more subtle. The community's first job, he stated, is to know what its goal is in this new unsure reality. Though Ukraine is very sensitive to ideological meddling, especially from Ukrainian organizations in the diaspora, sound critiques are welcome, Dr. Hryhorczuk said. He suggested that, rather than directing Ukraine, the Ukrainian community should create an atmosphere that will support good people in Ukraine working toward laudable goals. He gave an example of the work of the Ukrainian Society of Philatelists and Numismatics, which gives prizes for the best Ukrainian stamp design, and is engaged in earnest critique of past designs inherited from the Soviet era. He complimented Ukraine Post for supporting Ukrainian themes in its postal issues. Secondly, he observed, the diaspora itself is changing, even as it attempts to influence American policy toward Ukraine. Younger generations should be encouraged to taken an active part in American political life and in doing so influence Ukraine itself. The second speaker had another perspective on what the Ukrainian community should do. I am approaching the question from a different angle than Dr. Hryhorczuk: I want our community to exist for its own sake, said Mr. Berezowsky. In order to keep the community alive there has to be a better appreciation of the role that Ukrainian schools play in acculturating the younger generation, Mr. Berezowsky stated. There are significant problems that the community faces internally, he continued. There are fewer people who can pass on the language and culture, what the speaker called Ukrainian spirituality. Thus, the role of Ukrainian schools becomes more significant, yet the community does not appreciate their role in the lives of the younger generation. If the school does not exist, if the children do not attend, there will be no children growing in the understanding of their duty, he said. He suggested that it is time to focus on the critical part that schools of Ukrainian studies are now playing, and suggested that Ukrainian organizations should help that educational system develop new materials for a new generation. Drawing on his own active role in Ukrainian studies schools, Mr. Berezowsky said the community has to acknowledge a growing reality: the lack of Ukrainian fluency. He asked if it is not better for patriotic Ukrainians to get together in English to discuss common issues, than not to get together at all. He ended by thanking the older generations, those who came from Europe, for their hard work in developing and keeping the community alive. Mrs. McConnell continued the topic of how to help Ukraine, especially as fewer and fewer dollars are available from the Ukrainian diaspora. There are two approaches and both entail going outside of the Ukrainian community for material help and alliances, she noted. First, she emphasized, it is very important to continue and again to strengthen our political activity in Washington. It is extremely critical. The reason: there are real consequences for Ukraine, and there is a lot of competition throughout the world for U.S. assistance. Secondly, there are other sources for help outside of the government. As an example the speaker cited the Ukrainian-American Business Council, which has as members American companies wanting to do business in Ukraine, as well as various foundations. Mrs. McConnell reported that she is working to bring together smaller American cities with Ukrainian ones. She emphasized, for instance, the empathy toward Ukrainians she found among most Southerners because they lost the Civil War. Mrs. McConnell concluded by stating that she is hopeful regarding the future of Ukraine, and related that the Ukrainian community has yet to tap all the resources now available to it in order to help Ukraine. Mr. Chomiak, a veteran journalist, encouraged the community to refocus and reorient itself to new realities. Reporting that today, we have a very different situation, Mr. Chomiak provided a brief examination of the new roles of traditional community institutions, such as Churches and fraternal associations, that had worked so well in the past and now are facing new strains. There was a real need for surrogates -- Churches and fraternal organizations, he said, because there was no representation of Ukrainian interests in the world. However, now things have changed, he noted, emphasizing the different mission of Churches and community organizations. He suggested that use of the Church as a surrogate embassy should be relinquished in favor of the real thing, because a narrow focus on the type of religion that Ukrainians have either in Ukraine or here, he argued, is counterproductive in an era when Ukrainians could be Muslim or Protestant. He related that the real material help for the poor in Ukraine provided by evangelical groups has been looked at with suspicion rather than with gratitude. Fraternal organizations also should refocus their purpose, Mr. Chomiak stated. In such organizations, he commented, there needs to be -- as in the case of the Sears company's reorganization -- a rededication to the original purposes of fraternal associations in order to regain financial strength and, in turn, to continue their good work.

"REPORTS FROM WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES ASSEMBLY: Moderator Calls For Violators Of Human Rights To Be Brought To Justice The Moderator of the World Council of Churches' Central Committee issued a strong affirmation of human rights Friday December 4 and said that violators of those rights must be held accountable to humanity. His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of Cilicia, also said that the WCC's relationship with its Orthodox members, while not yet in a crisis state, was critical and too little had been done to bring them into creative interaction with the Council's Western Protestant thinking and methods. In a wide-ranging report to delegates of the WCC's Eighth Assembly, 3-14 December, Aram expressed a vision of a better world if the WCC's member churches helped diverse ethnic and religious groups to learn to live together as one community and if ecumenical leadership took advantage of today's committed and visionary young people. His report included an analysis of the Council's programs in the seven years since its last Assembly in Canberra. The 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10 will be commemorated by the Assembly. Aram described current ethnic conflicts around the world that have led to increasing violations of human rights. He deplored the fact that many individuals and nations that commit acts of genocide, war crimes and injustice were not called to justice. The popular saying, `You can run but you cannot hide is being turned on its head,' he said. Delegates and visitors applauded as Aram I called for the prosecution of human rights violators. There is a crying need to bring to justice and to make accountable those responsible for policies leading to violations of the rights and dignity of women and children, communities and nations, he said. The member churches could help to create a healthier environment for human rights by working together with other faiths to seek a global ethics based on shared ethical values that transcend religious beliefs and narrow definitions of national interests. Addressing an issue widely discussed before the Assembly began this week, Aram called upon Orthodox and other members of the Council to maintain their commitment to one another. Orthodox members have played an important role in the WCC, bringing significant contributions to ecumenical thinking and spirituality, he said. Even so, Orthodox churches have not integrated themselves fully into the life of the WCC because of Council practices and methods that were not compatible with Orthodox tradition. Unless the Assembly takes this present situation seriously, Aram said, I fear that the Orthodox participation will steadily dwindle. He called upon Orthodox members to come to the Council with a clear agenda and an open attitude and he asked other WCC members to provide ample space and opportunities for Orthodox. It is time that the Orthodox churches move from monologue to dialogue, from reaction to action, from contribution to participation, from being observers to becoming full partners in the WCC. Aram I's analysis of Orthodox-WCC relationships was part of his comments on the Council's Common Understanding and Vision planning document (CUV), which has led to proposed constitutional amendments that will come before the delegates at this meeting. In the next decade and the next millennium, the Moderator said, the Council will find itself facing new social and political realities. We have all become neighbors in a global village, black and white, rich and poor, Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, followers of other faiths or atheist. Torn by our differences and tensions, we do not yet know how to live together in a world in which we are bound to live together in one community. Referring to the Assembly theme Turn to God - Rejoice in Hope, he said: Turning to God implies turning to our neighbor in active love, justice and reconciliation. On December 13th, during the 50th anniversary celebration of the WCC, we will be invited to reaffirm our commitment by saying `We intend to stay together.' Because of time restraints, Aram I did not read aloud a large portion of his printed address, reporting on important WCC achievements in faith and order, Christian education, mission and healing ministries. He cited the Ecumenical Decade of the Churches in Solidarity with Women, the integration of youth into the WCC, programs to improve ecology and the Program to Overcome Violence. Four thousand international representatives and visitors are meeting in Harare for the two-week Assembly, which meets every seven years to set policy goals for the WCC and to provide a multi-cultural celebration of the Christian faith.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1998-12-12,0
"The Saga of Abdullah Ocalan and Lessons to be Learned: Political Games from Nagorno-Karabagh to Kurdistan Last weekend, the charismatic leader of the PKK (Partia Kakaren Kurdistan, known in the West as Kurdish Workers Party) Abdullah Ocalan requested political asylum in Italy, and Italy's Premiere Massimo Russia and Belarus rejected his earlier appeals for refuge: in fact. Russia's Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov informed the Turkish ambassador that Mr. Ocalan was on an Aeroflot flight on his way to Rome. After all, with its ethnic problems in Chechnya. Daghestan, Inguishetia and other Muslim and Turkic regions, Russia wouldn't dare openly oppose Turkey, even though clandestinely it may support the Kurdish quest for cultural autonomy in Turkey. The Kurdish problems in Turkey and Russia's quarrel in Chechnya are linked more closely than what is acknowledged by both Ankara and Moscow. It is not a secret that the Turks were financing and supporting the war in Chechnya until Moscow warned them that they might act in the same way in the Kurdish region in Turkey. Knowing how the Bolsheviks and Kemalists cooperated in 1920 to jointly undermine the independence and territorial integrity of the infant First Armenian Republic, this recent collusion of Turkish-Russian interests is no surprise to the people. RUSSIAN VS. TURKISH FOREIGN POLICY The leverage of the foreign policies of Turkey and Russia, in relation to one another, has greatly weakened because of the Kurdish and Chechen problems; therefore, they both are forced to cooperate openly, yet overtly they are trying to undermine one another in the Caucasus, Caspian Basin, and Central Asia. Kurds, Armenians, Georgians, Azeris, Abkhazians, Ajars, Ossetians, Chechens and others are pawns in the great strategic chess game. Turks and Russians continue to cooperate economically: the two countries agreed that the natural-gas agreement would continue for 20 years; Turkey would spend part of a $350 million investment credit in Russia; and Turkish enterprises would continue construction projects in Russia. Moscow is also involved in the construction of an iron-steel plant and hydroelectric stations in Turkey, just to name a few. Yet, when it comes to the oil pipeline project, to deliver natural gas and crude oil from the Caspian Basin and Caucasus. Russia and Turkey are competing and often undermining one other. Ankara has been waging a war against the Kurds for the past twenty years (in fact, since 1920) in the Kurdish-populated region of Turkey (former Armenian-inhabited Eastern Anatolia). The war resulted in the destruction of 5,000 Kurdish villages, deportation and relocation of 3 million Kurds, exodus of 3 million Kurds to Germany, Belgium. Holland, France, and execution or political assassination of thousands of Kurdish political activists and intellectuals, and 37,000 dead. TURKISH NATION-BUILDING PROCESS As Professor Dogu Ergil from the Political Science Faculty of Ankara University stated, from the Kemalist Nationalist movement in 1919-1923 until now, the nation-building process in Turkey [went] from a multicultural and multinational endeavor from [the] Ottoman past [and] took a decisive turn towards Turkification of the population, especially after [the] first Kurdish rebellion in 1925. According to Prof. Ergil, the vision of multiculturalism, or cultural federalism, was abandoned in the early nation-building process in the Turkish Republic, and authoritarian, bureaucratic state structures were built by a hierarchy of Turkish nationalists. He continues, This Kemalist-military structure professed to be not only the saviors of the Turkish nation but vanguards and guides as well. This tradition continues until today; intolerance to dissention regarding Kemalist views, intolerance to multiculturalism and multiethnic diversity is the core of this political movement, and distention over Turkish nationalism, and disobedience to national leadership, and national uniform body politic is not tolerated. Professor Ergil correctly states that the seeds of alienation and an unequal relationship between the state and society stem from the Turkification and assimilation policy of the Kemalist movement, to create Turkey for Turks only. ROOTS OF TURKISH-KURDISH CONFLICT The conflict between Kurds and Turks is the result of this policy; Turks want to Turkify all non-Turks, and Kurds are resisting assimilation as they try to preserve their national identity. Prof. Ergil correctly states, The restrictive definition of nationhood created a sense of exclusion among the non-Turkish citizenship. It is a fact that the real natives of Anatolia, like Armenians and Kurds, are treated like aliens. The departure of Mr. Ocalan from Syria by no means heralds the end of the Kurdish liberation movement. It merely moves the Kurdish issue from the military to the political arena, in the heart of Europe where sympathy towards the Kurdish liberation movement, and approbation of Turkish human-rights violations is strong among intellectuals in Belgium, Sweden, Germany, France and Italy. Turkish officials described Abdullah Ocalan as Turkey's most wanted terrorist and dangerous man, and they requested his extradition from Italy. For Kurds and members of the Kurdish parliament in exile in Europe (Belgium), Mr. Ocalan remains a symbol of the Kurdish freedom and liberation movement. Outside the Rome Military Hospital where Mr. Ocalan is being held, hundreds of Kurdish men and women cried and called him Our President. Kurds all over Europe and members of the strong Kurdish Parliament in exile are calling on all concerned to encourage the Italian government to take the historic step and grant political asylum to Apo (nickname for Ocalan, meaning Uncle). According to Kurdish politicians in exile, Mr. Ocalan has a crucial role to play in any future resolution of the Kurdish conflict and the world needs to recognize this. OCALAN A TERRORIST? Is Mr. Ocalan a terrorist? We should not forget that the first US President George Washington, and former Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin used to be called terrorists by the British. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk of Turkey was called a rebel by the last Ottoman government; Nelson Mandela served a 27-year jail sentence during the South African apartheid struggle before emerging to become president. Former President Lech Walesa of Poland and President of Czech Republic Vaceslav Havel were condemned by the Communists for undermining the system. The list goes on and on. Kurdish sources in Europe claim that Mr. Ocalan's arrival in Italy has a political aim. They emphasize that the Turkish Republic has waged a war of genocide against the Kurdish nation similar to the ones it has waged against the Armenians, the Assyrians, the Greeks and other peoples. They claim that in the person of Apo, the Turkish Republic is trying to bury our national future in the dark. Obviously the Kurdish struggle is larger than one man's political future and, no matter what happens to Apo, the Kurdish issue will not disappear. For the first time in decades, the Turkish intelligentsia in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Diarbekir is now recognizing that a political solution is the only answer; more military operations, more deaths will widen the gap between the Turkish and Kurdish societies. PROBLEM WON'T GO AWAY Twenty-five million stateless Kurds will not disappear, nor will they be assimilated. Kurdish political activities are very effective in Europe and Russia. Kurds are well organized and the Kurdish Diaspora, about 3 million strong throughout Europe, is carrying on an efficacious political campaign to the degree of preventing Turkish integration into the European Union on account of its human-rights violations and anti-Kurdish stand. A group of representatives of the Kurdistan Workers Party's TV broadcasting arm, Med TV, is expected to arrive in Washington for a round of talks with diplomatic circles and US government officials. Ankara is very mad over Washington's role in bringing two Kurdish faction leaders, Talabani and Barzani, together. The Washington agreement, signed by two Iraqi Kurdish groups under the auspices of the US at the level of the Secretary of State, angered Turkey's leaders. Turks are getting suspicious, as the Western capitals and Washington are realizing that without a just solution of the Kurdish problem, desired political stability and realization of the oil pipeline projects will not be possible. THE NAGORNO-KARABAGH PARALLEL The same situation is applicable in the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict. The latest proposals by the mediators are indicative of a realization of the real politics in the region. The mediators from Russia, the US, and France, the three co-chairmen of the Minsk group, are now proposing the creation of a common state which would be formed by the Karabagh Armenians and the Azerbaijani government. Implicit herein is the suggestion of a confederation of equal sovereign nations. This plan federal of equal sovereign nations. This plan makes no mention of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, offers a comprehensive package strategy, and rules out subordination of Karabagh to Azerbaijan. The Azeris are not happy that this proposal fails to guarantee the restoration of Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Karabagh. Finally the US realized that, for the oil pipeline projects to become a reality, a just and permanent solution to the Karabagh conflict is a necessity. Eruption of armed conflicts in the region is contrary to the interests of the oil companies. This policy change became possible because of the correct policy of President Robert Kocharian. The defeatists, lead by former President Levon Der Bedrosian, falsely claimed that Armenia and Karabagh are weak national who have to realize that maximal demands would be unacceptable by the international community; Armenians have to be satisfied with self-rule and accept Azeri sovereignty. The liberals, AIM Magazine, The Armenian Mirror-Spectator, Nor Or, Ronald G. Suny, Ashot Bleyan, Vano Siradeghian, etc. were all playing the same tune. Now they have been proved to be wrong. The determination and steadfastness of the Karabagh Armenians will pay off and a just solution to the Karabagh conflict, with recognition of self-determination rights for the people of Karabagh, will became reality. The confederation between the two sovereign nations within the common state - NKR with Armenia, or NKR with Azerbaijan - will require further negotiations. Events in the Kurdish regions of Iraq and Turkey, and events in the Caucasus, whether in Chechnya, Daghestan, Ossetia, Abkhazia, Ajaria, Akhalkalaki, or Karabagh, are all related; they form the core of the struggle between hegemony and independence, assimilation and national self-awareness, enslavement and national liberation. It is the struggle between evil and good. It is about time for Armenians to have self-confidence, national awareness, adherence to the national Armenian cause, and develop political knowledge and maturity, political discipline, and activism to promote the Armenian national interests, not the national interests of others. The defeatists proved to be wrong, it is about time to encourage the winners.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-11-21,0
"Turkish Dupery and Armenian Naivete Armenians are very intelligent, patriotic, and industrious people, but they sometimes behave very naively in easily trusting foreign promises or praise. This shortcoming comes partially from a sense of insecurity and the urge to believe someone since, as a nation, we have been abused, lied to, and rubbed the wrong way very often by foreigners. We built our homes and monuments but our enemies destroyed them. We worked hard and we were taxed triple, more than the Muslim population of the land. We contributed to the culture, economy, and art of occupying powers, yet we were accused of being disloyal, and finally we were accused of being aliens in our own ancestral land. For the insecure Armenian, any promise became a source of hope but when we were deceived, he result was despair. We then began to blame ourselves for others' duplicity. REVISIONIST HISTORIANS Two Turkish historians, Engin Deniz Akarli and Selim Deringil, are the products of revisionist Turkish history schools, heavily influenced by Ahmet Esat Uras's book, Armenians in History and the Armenian Question (Tarihte Ermeniler ve Ermeni Meselesi). It is important to introduce Ahmet Esat Uras. He was born in 1882 in Amasya. He graduated from Fatih Military Junior High School (Faith Askeri Rustiyesi), and Vefa's Political Science Faculty (Vefa Idadisi, ve Mektebi Mulkiyeyi Sahane). He was a member of the Pan-Turkist Committee of Union and Progress (CUP, OR Ittihad ve Terakki Cemiyeti) and, in the service of talat, Enver and Djemal, he was personally and actively involved in Armenian deportations and massacres. After WWI, when the Ottoman Empire and Central Powers collapsed and surrendered to the Triple Entente Powers, Uras was in a panic. He was ready to surrender to the British in Aleppo (Haleb), fearing for his personal safety, and he was ready to disclose the Ottoman Government secrets pertaining to the Armenian Genocide. Later, like the rest of the Young Turks, CUP's party functionaries with criminal records and responsible for the Armenian Genocide, he escaped. The leader of the new Turkish nationalist movement, Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk), called Uras to Ankara and assigned him to the Internal Security Agency. Like Uras, many of the former Ittihadists were joining the nationalist movement. Later, Uras come to Kars, where he organized Kazim Karabekir Pasha's attack on Armenia on October 7, 1920. One of the perpetrators and executors of the Armenian Genocide and the organizer of the aggression against the young Armenian Republic, he decided to become a historian in the latter part of his life, and, through revisions and distortions, the perpetrator became the accuser of the victim. Uras opened a new chapter in the historical interpretation of Turkish-Armenian relations, and his influence still continues. DADRIAN UNCOVERS EVIDENCE Professor Vahakn Dadrian points out these Turkish deceptions and duplicity. According to him, At the time when Ankara was assuring the government of the Republic of Armenia (in 1920) that the new Kemalist nationalist government wished to establish good neighborly relations, on the same day, however, Ankara was giving different instructions to Kazim Karabekir Pasha to eliminate Armenia politically and physically. (Ermenistani siyaseten ve maddeten imhasi gereklidir) There is no question that the policy of the Pan-Turkists Talat, Enver, and Djemal during the Young Turks' period (1911-1915) and the nationalist Kemalist policy (1919-1923) were basically anti-Armenian and racist in character, and had expansionist and imperialistic designs. The ascendancy of the former Ittihadists to high positions in the newly formed Turkish Republic was not uncommon. Tefik Rustu Aras (1883-1972) was a member of the first Grand National Assembly in Ankara. He later become Foreign Minister of Turkey, and then secretary of RPP. Hasan Husnu Saka (1886-1960) was an aide to Ismet Inonu at the Lausanne Conference; later, he became Foreign Minister (1944-1946) and Prime Minister (1947-1949). Sukru Saracoglu (1997-1953) likewise became Minister of Education, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, and finally Prime Minister. The list goes on and on. It is a known fact that when the Young Turks asked Armenian political parties to work together to reform the Ottoman system and create an Ottoman society serving all citizens' interests, the Armenians were duped since, as soon as the Red Sultan Abdul Hamid II was deposed, the Young Turks turned against the Armenians. Instead of promised reforms, the Young Turks implemented the promised destruction of the Armenian race. DUPING CONTINUES Both Engin Deniz Akarli and Selim Deringil are duping the Armenians in the latest issue of Armenian Forum (Number 2, Summer 1998), like their predecessors once did. Both try to convince Armenians that the Young Turk movement had no Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist notion; instead, it had Pan-Ottomanist and Pan-Islamist factions to maintain the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. But historical realities are proving otherwise. The program of the CUP was clearly set out in the declaration of its Salonika Congress, secret and open, that the building of the new Ottoman Empire was in progress. The empire was meant only for Turks, and the expansion of the empire to the other Turkic regions of Caucasus and Central Asia was the objective, while the elimination of foreign elements (Armenians) was a priority. Iitihadist Ottoman General Khalil Pasha stated in September 1918: We want to establish our links with our former territory Turan (Turkic-speaking regions of Central Asia used to be called Turkestan) and, for this purpose, we need a passage connecting our two countries, unhampered by foreign jurisdiction (Armenians). This is an unambiguous manifestation of pan-Turkist policy. Vehip Pasha, the Commander of the Ottoman Army in the Eastern Front in 1918, made a similar policy statement: We have left the Balkans and we are also leaving Africa, but it is our duty to spread to the east, for it is there that our blood, our faith, and our language are to be found. The half brother of Enver Pasha, and the Commander of the Second Ottoman Division Nuri Pasha actually carried out this policy in Karabagh, attacking Shushi and Armenian Karabagh. Vahakn Dadrian, the eminent genocide scholar, documents these confessions and policy statements by various Ottoman military, political and public figures over and over again. Unfortunately, one Armenian descendant and so-called scholar intentionally ignores Dadrian's gigantic, academically and intellectually honest works, and refuses to acknowledge his overwhelmingly convincing documentation as fact. Through the revisionist approaches of Akarli and Deringil, the Turks are once again duping the Armenians in the pages of Armenian Forum. Interestingly enough, a recent statement by Suleyman Demirel, President of Turkey, proves otherwise, that Akarli and Deringil, by denying the existence of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism, were intentionally trying to mislead the naive Armenian public opinion. PAN-TURANISM OF TURKISH PRESIDENT Recently, the Turkish professor Turker Alkan, in the August 30, 1998 issue of Hurriyet (Liberty) newspaper, quoting President Demirel's emotional speech before a gathering of Turkic leaders, criticized Demirel for his nationalistic outburst. He writes, In his speech President Demirel, reminiscing about `Ergenokon, Destani' (The Epic of Ergenekon, where the Grey Wolf' [Bozkurt] leads the Turkic tribes to freedom and victory - M.A.), got emotional with tears in his eyes, and the President proclaimed: `The Turkish world is extending from the Adriatic Sea to the Wall of China.' This is the same Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist dream of the Young Turks that was articulated by the leader of modern Turkey in the year of 1998. Being more candid and open than Akarli and Deringil, Professor Alkan, instead of denying the existence of Pan-Turkism, condemns it openly in his column, stating Where the heck does the notion of the Wall of China become part of the President's speech? How would we react if the President of China proclaimed that the Chinese world is extending From the Wall of China to the Istanbul Straits? President Demirel's statement is a slap in the face of those denying the existence of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism. In order to defend Armenian national interests in Armenia and Karabagh, naive Armenians should make every effort to enhance their knowledge about Turkey and the Turks. For this, it is a must to study and read historical and contemporary Turkish academic publications, periodicals of the Turkish Historical Society, and statements by Turkish officials. It is a must to read Turkish textbooks, newspaper columns or listen to radio and television commentators, and follow the Turkish parliamentarians' debates in reference to Armenia, Caucasus, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, Kurds, and oil pipelines in order to understand the Turkish mentality and thinking. Superficial approaches to Turkish-Armenian relations based on false assumptions, predictions, or goodwill of a few, or under instructions of third parties to generate a favorable atmosphere for rapprochement are dangerous, and put the national security of Armenia and Karabagh at risk with unpredictable consequences. LITTLE CHANGE OF ATTITUDE Historical and contemporary Turkish official behavior - from the premeditated, organized, planned, and executed Armenian genocide, to the destruction of the First Armenian Republic; from the blockade to the efforts to isolate the Second Armenian Republic, the use of threats against Armenia and siding with the Azeris in the Karabagh dispute, and falsely blaming Armenians for sheltering Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan - convinces us that not much has changed in Ankara's attitude toward Armenians. Not to mention the destruction of the Armenian monuments in Turkey, conspiring with Azeris to keep Armenia out of regional economic cooperation and transportation agreements. Arming and training Azeris against Armenia, and coordinating efforts to end Armenian control over Karabagh. Genuine rapprochement between Armenia and Turkey may be possible if Turkey renounces Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism, or accepts responsibility for the Armenian Genocide. The establishment of real democracy in Turkey will enable the Turkish state to recognize the rights of all citizens, not only those with Turkish DNA, but everyone who has its root in that land. The Ottoman Empire was an ethnic, religious, and cultural mosaic of many nations; the Turkish state inherited the land but eliminated the existing mosaic intentionally, for the creation of Turkey for Turks only. If and when the Armenians shed their naivete, and the Turks end their charade, then they will be able to talk about the real issues.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-11-14,0
"Armenia '98, Part II of III: The Struggles Of The Brave Karabagh People Professor Vahakn Dadrian was invited to Stepanakert to continue his lecture series on the Armenian Genocide for after all, the evil the genocide is still threatening the Karabagh Armenians. It not for their fierce resistance against deportation orders by Baku, today there wouldn't be a single Armenian soul living in Karabagh, this is a fact. A giant military helicopter took off from Erebuni Airport on October 10, carrying twenty-two Armenian Americans, along with Vahakn Dadrian and Zori Balayan. The latter and Bishop of Karabagh Barkev Mardirossian, who were early pioneers of the Karabagh movement, did enormous work for Karabagh's independence. During the period of perestroika and glasnost under Gorbachev, Armenians both in Armenia and Karabagh sensed that it was time to raise the Karabagh issue, to correct the past mistakes of Stalin and reverse the historical injustice. HEARS PROTEST VOICES AGAIN As the helicopter started to flyover the rugged and mountainous terrain, the noise of the craft brought the protest voices of millions of demonstrators in Opera Square to my ears. I could see the image of them raising their first in the air and chanting in one voice, Garabaghe merne, Garabaghe merne (Karabagh is ours, Karabagh is ours). In February 1988, at an extraordinary session of the Karabagh Supreme Soviet, representatives adopted a resolution calling on the Soviets of Armenia and Azerbaijan of make every effort to reach the decision to transfer Karabagh from Azerbaijani rule to Armenia. The Armenian people, under the leadership of Victor Hambartsumian, Sylva Gabudikian, Igor Muradian, Vazgen Manukian, Hambartsum Galstian and others confirmed their solidarity with their brothers and sisters in Karabagh. The Karabagh Committee members gradually developed a strong support among the populace and gradually assumed the leadership of political life in Yerevan. Meanwhile, Garen Demirchian, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Soviet Armenia, infuriated demonstrators by stating The changes demanded run counter to the interests of the workers of the Armenia and Azerbaijan, using old communist cliches and party jargon. This is reminiscent of what the Bolsheviks said back in 1917: Workers of the World, Unite. Unite for what? To give up sacred Armenian lands to the Turks, Georgians, and Azeris, Keeping Kars, Ardahan, Akhalkalaki, Nakhichevan, and Karabagh under foreign rule. ATTEMPTS TO DRIVE ARMENIANS OUT The Sumgait tragedy revived the memory of 1915. By July 1990 the authorities in Azerbaijan formulated a plan for deportation of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabagh, and anti-Armenian pogroms in Baku resulted in deaths, the destruction of Armenian properties, including churches, and the deportation of Armenians from Baku and Kirovabad (Ghanja) followed. Azerbaijani Special Forces, along with the Soviet 4th Army, carried out brutal deportations of entire Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabagh and adjacent regions like Getashen and Shahoumian. While the Armenian people was licking its wounds after the December 1988 earthquake, Azeri authorities imposed blockades on Armenia and Karabagh, aimed at causing death by slow strangulation, and they prevented the arrival of essential supplies, food, emergency medical and humanitarian aid. The Azeri Army used first the fearsome GRAD multiple missile rocket launchers against the civilians of Nagorno-Karabagh, causing death to women and children. Through aerial bombardment using cluster bombs supplied by NATO member Turkey, the Azeris indiscriminately destroyed civilian targets, population centers, residential areas and factories. It was the beginning of the second Armenian Genocide. To accomplish its Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist dream, Azerbaijan's principal ally and perpetrator of the first Armenian Genocide, Turkey, supplied Azerbaijan with senior retired Turkish military advisors, giving NATO-supplied equipment; the aim of maintaining a second blockade against Armenia was to suffocate and obliterate Armenia once and for all. THE VIEW IS AWESOME While the sequence of past events was unveiling in my memory, Zori Balayan called me to the cockpit of the helicopter to show that we were about to enter the airspace of Karabagh. The name of Karabagh hit me like magic; its name has been synonymous with the independence struggle of the Armenian nation for centuries. Karabaghis have always zealously guarded their Armenian identity against intruders. The view is awesome. The mountain ranges, with their snowy peaks, form natural barriers against foreign invaders. To the north are the Murov mountain ranges with a maximum height of 12,215 feet and, to the south, the Mountainous Karabagh range with a maximum of 8,938 feet of elevation. To the northeast and east, there are the plains and slope into Azerbaijan proper. Through an aerial view, one can easily appreciate the fact that Karabagh's landscape is a natural continuation of the rugged mountainous terrain of Armenia, forming a uniform geographical entity. Our adversaries tried to separate Armenia from Karabagh with an artificially created strip of land, from Kelbajar on the north and Latchin to the south. In the air, one can see the Gahdzasar, Davidvash, Gtichavank, and Khatavank monasteries, which are living witnesses to the Armenian presence in this land from the time of antiquity. To the north lies Stepanakert and Aghdam; to the south, liberated Shusha (Shushi). One can truly appreciate the importance of the Latchin corridor and admire the Armenian people for creating the Goris-Stepanakert highway, stretching through the mountainous terrain. POTENTIAL IS IN PEOPLE Mountainous Karabagh, as the locals prefer to call it, occupies an era of 1,700 square miles (4,400 square km.) Its environments vary from steppe on the Kura lowland to dense forests of oak, hornbeam, and beech on the lower mountain slopes and birchwood and alpine meadows higher up. Vineyards, orchards, and mulberry groves, coupled with agriculture and food processing, give Karabagh export potential. With good pasture, they can raise cattle, sheep, and pigs. The region also has some light industry. But Karabagh's main potential is its brave and intelligent people. Karabagh is the easternmost outpost of the Armenian plateau, and it was known in medieval times as the Armenian province of Artsakh. Fifteen hundred ancient Armenian monuments and monasteries built in Armenian-style architecture attest to its Armenian past and present. The earliest historical evidence in this region dates from the Urartu period and its was called the province of Uretkhe, which is the verbal ancestor of Artsakh, based on linguistic evolution. According to the eminent ancient Armenian historian Movses Khorenatsi, the province of Utik with Artsakh formed part of the Armenian Kingdom of Ervanduni in the 2nd and 4th centuries BC, and according to the Greek historian Strabo, all spoke the same Armenian language. Partitioned between the Ottoman and Persian empires, Armenian had long lost its sovereignty in the fourteenth century. Only the Karabagh meliks were able to maintain their independence and protect the Armenian population from foreign invaders. KARABAGH BASTION OF INDEPENDENCE The Karabagh nobles and leading princely families survived until modern times, maintaining national identity and making Karabagh the bastion of Armenian political, national and cultural consciousness. As David Beg formed a political and military organization at Gandzasar and coordinated military capability in Sunik to defend the motherland, Karabaghis demonstrated their love, loyalty and military prowess to their adversaries. This tradition continues today. The Turkish General Khalil Pasha threatened the Armenian leaders in September 1918, as their descendants are doing today. He stated, We want to establish our links with our former territory, Turan (Turkestan and Central Asian Turkic world M.A.) Vehip Pasha, the commander of the Turkish army on the eastern front in 1918, was more blunt. He stated, We have left the Balkans and we are also leaving Africa, but it is there that our blood, our faith, and our language are to be found. (Classical Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist dream. In Armenian Forum, Number 2, Summer 1998 issue, Turkish historians Engin Deniz Akarli and Selim Deringil try to convince the gullible Armenian in their own publication that Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism was not an issue in the decision to deport and commit genocide against the Armenians. Ronald Grigor Suny, in his reply to these Turks, was too apologetic, promising then that he will be more careful in the future when using the terms Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist M.A.) EVENTS OF 1918 The Armenians of Karabagh put up a fierce resistance against the invading Ottoman armies in 1918. The Second Ottoman Division, based in Aghdam, attacked Shusha. Nuri Pasha, the half-brother of murderer Enver Pasha, poured into Karabagh with a force of 5,000 Turkish askers (soldiers) and met heavy Armenian resistance. The Turks fell into ambush and, on November 2, 1918, most of the Turkish troops were decimated and retreated. At the end of WWI, Turkey lost the war and evacuated Mountainous Karabagh. The British come from the south and began to take control of oil-rich Azerbaijan; in the process, they made every treacherous effort to maintain AzeriTatar control over Karabagh, even over Zangezur, and kept their eyes closed to Azeri atrocities against the defenseless Armenian population of Shusha and other regions of Karabagh. VISIT TO STEPANAKER & AGHDAM Finally our helicopter landed at Stepanakert Airport, and we set foot for the first time on liberated and sacred Karabagh soil. It is quite difficult to grasp what Karabagh means for the Armenian spirit, pride, and security. Karabagh is Armenia, the cradle of the Armenian liberation movement, freedom, and the birthplace of many world-renowned military commanders. First, our group was taken to Aghdam by bus. There, witnessing the degree of destruction, one can imagine the ferocity of the battle between the conflicting parties that took place in this contested land. The Armenians made a special effort not to inflict any damage to the Muslim cemetery and mosque. Knowing how the Turks and Azeris destroyed the Armenian cemeteries and churches, one can attest to the degree of civilization and tolerance of these two distinct cultures. Aghdam once was used by the Turkish commanders Khalil, Vehip, and Nuri Pashas as a staging point of war of aggression against the Armenian civilians; the modern-day Azeris did the same thing. With Stepanakert being within easy range of Azeri GRAD rocket attacks from the direction of Aghdam in the northeast and Shusha in the southwest, the Karabagh Armenians were forced to defend themselves and take appropriate action to silence the centers of destruction. The moment Karabagh Armenians took the initiative to expel the foreign invaders and hired mercenaries from their land, by creating a security zone, the enemy sued for a cease-fire in May 1994. Then we drove to Stepanakert, where the traces of war have almost been eliminated through heroic reconstruction efforts. However, the trace of war is visible in the eyes of the people the children who lost their fathers and brothers on the front lines. Shame on those daring and conceding to keep Karabagh within Azerbaijan! That is nothing short of blasphemy. The meal that the welcoming Stepanakertsies gave to us will not be forgotten; they shared their bread and the fruit of their labor with us, and we were all thankful for their hospitality. Professor Vahakn Dadrian and all the participants of this pilgrimage were very touched by the gallantry of this brave people. The same hospitality was granted to us in Gandzasar, where the famous monastery is located overlooking the breathtaking view of snow-peaked mountain ranges and valleys Finally we arrived at Shusha (Shushi) after climbing up hills and gorges. In Shusha, you can have an aerial view of Stepanakert and then you realize the strategic importance of this town. The battle of Shusha was the turning point of the Karabagh war of liberation. The newly renovated Cathedral of Shusha attests to the liberation of the sacred land of Mountainous Karabagh which is a reality; the traces of Azerbaijani SU 25 bombardment are now overtaken by the reconstruction of Armenian Shusha once and for all.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-10-31,0
"Responsibilities Of The Genocide The exchange of articles in The Armenian Reporter Int'l in August 198 by Prof. Ronald Suny and Dr. Murat Acemoglu brings forth the question of premeditation of the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish Government in 1915. First, I would like to commend Prof. Suny for taking advantage of an invitation to give a lecture at the Koc University in Istanbul, Turkey. Although the Turks know very well what happened in 1915, it was very useful to give them more information about that great crime. We would like to hear how much and what kind of coverage Prof. Suny's lecture was given in the Turkish media. Prof. Suny writes in his article that one of the reasons for the Genocide was the defeat of the Turkish army at the hands of the Russians in the winter of 1914-1915, during which a few thousand Russian-Armenian citizens foughts in the Russian army or in guerrilla bands. For this reason, the Turks, until today, accuse Turkish Armenians of having been disloyal citizens. This reasoning is incorrect because the Genocide was planned starting in 1910, according to official documents. It is very regrettable that Prof. Suny seems not to have read Prof. Vahakh Dadrian's book, The History of the Armenian Genocide (pages 180-184). These pages show the premeditation of the Ittihad party to deport and massacre the Armenians and other minorities living in Turkey. During the ruling Ittihad's annual Congress in 1910 in Salonika (Turkish territory at that time), Talaat Pasha, Interior Minister, gave secret speeches advising the delegates of the plans to homogenize the peoples in Turkey and stop the intervention of foreign powers on behalf of Armenians and other minorities. Intelligence sources informed the French Consul Choublier, British vice Consul Arthur Geary and Austrian Vice consul Zitkovsky of the speech which was naturally cabled to their respective governments. These reports are available today to any researcher, and the Armenian nation is eternally indebted to Prof. Dadrian for finding and publishing them. I read some time ago that two Ittihad delegates (no names available) to that Salonika Congress did not approve of this plan, did not object publicly, but informed some leaders of the Hunchak party of the imminent danger to the Armenian people in Turkey. The Hunchak party contacted another Armenian political party to help assassinate the leadership of the Ittihad party. The second political party would not believe the information so the Hunchak party decided to go it alone and voted to do so at the Hunchak Party Congress in Costanza, Rumania in 1913. After a while, an Armenian traitor [Arshavir Arthur Yasian of Yozgat - ed.] informed the Turkish government of this plan; 20 Hunchak leaders were subsequently arrested and, after a trial, were hanged at Bayazid Square in Istanbul, on June 15, 1915. The Armenian carpenter who built the e20 gallows hanged himself after the 20 men had died. As for Pan-Turanism, it is still very much alive in different forms. Sometimes it's called Pan-Turkism. Nowadays, it's called the Silk Road Bill which is before the US Congress. Another evidence thereof is the presence of some 10,000 students in Turkey from the former Soviet Muslim republics whose language is Turkic or similar dialect. These Turkish-educated students will be the future leaders in their respective countries 10-20 years from now. I would have preferred if they had studied in Russia, Europe or the US. The official recognition and apologies by Turkey would help that country's standing in the family of civilized nations, but the Turks are afraid of lawsuits for damages by the victims and their heirs. After so many years, this question is debatable. Armenians should do everything to help any Turk who writes or speaks for the truth about the Armenian Genocide. This idea brings me to the articles and meetings to launch the new publication called The Armenian Forum. In the Summer 1998 issue, Professors Dadrian and Suny give their opinions about the Armenian Genocide, as do two Turkish professors. The two Turkish professors deny any notion of Pan-Turkism or Pan-Turanism in Turkish politics! One Turkish professor writes about the primary goal of the Turkish government as being reconquest of the Balkans and Egypt! I can't believe my eyes about Egypt. Unless they produce evidence to the contrary, Egypt was never in the immediate plan of conquest by the German-Turkish alliance. Their target was the Caucasus and India. Giving space in an Armenian publication to people who don't write the truth and push their propaganda under the guise of free speech is not acceptable unless the Armenian side is published in Turkish publications. I would like to bring to the attention of the readers what Prof. Richard Hovannisian said in The Armenian observer of Oct. 7, 1998, page 7: There is a need for caution in any dialogue with the Turks...","Nercessian, Nishan",Armenian Reporter International,1998-10-24,0
"Turkish and Armenian Academicians According to the official Turkish Government Web Center, Armenian sources in foreign countries are now involved against Turkey in an intensive defamation campaign which has reached great dimensions. The same source claims that This malicious propaganda based on certain repeated allegations by Armenian extremists has now acquired a racist character and it is being bolstered also by certain foreign sources for different purposes. The Turks claim that The Armenian propaganda is no more satisfied with unjust vilification of Turkey but it is now putting forward some baseless demands from Turkey and the Turkish people. The best defense is offense. Through the centuries, the Turkish military, policy makers, and misinformation campaign centers, including the Turkish Historical Society, emulated this philosophy rather successfully, alone or with the help of allies. They occupied others' lands, enslaved the indigenous population, claimed their culture and history, and created an empire in three continents - Europe, Asia, and Africa - which lasted about six centuries. They didn't tolerate any dissension, suppressed human rights, and ran the occupied territories with a strong-arm policy. They utilized the indigenous population's talent, plundered their wealth, and heavily taxed their hard-earned fruits of labor, taxing the so-called giaours (infidels) with special taxes almost double those applicable to Muslim subjects. RESISTANCE FOLLOWED BY REPRESSION Any demands by the Christian subjects to improve the existing social and taxation status, pleas to improve human rights, or requests to ask for equality with their Muslim compatriots, met with resistance from the Sublime Port, followed by more oppression. In the later stages, as the Ottoman Empire became weaker, the Christian subjects' efforts to improve the sick Ottoman society with reforms met with more suspicions in which the authorities began to accuse their Christian subjects of separatism, subversion and foreign servitude. The best example of all this was the brutal suppression of the Armenians, who had asked for reforms in the six Armenian-inhabited vilayets (provinces). The despotic Abdul Hamid II regime, and the bloodthirsty Young Turk dictatorship accused Armenians of separatism, and for cooperating with foreign enemies, since they asked the European powers to guarantee the reforms in the Armenian-inhabited regions of the Anatolia, as was promised by the consecutive Ottoman governments, under the international treaty obligations (Treaties of Berlin and San Stefano). The same Turkish habits even continue today, as the Turks are accusing the Kurds of separatism, subversion and terrorism, in order to deny them cultural autonomy, permission to use their own language, run their radio television station, or pursue their education in Kurdish schools. Why? Only to create Turkey for the Turks only, with the right DNA. A PECULIAR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION The Turkish Historical Society is a peculiar academic institution where the history of ancient Anatolian peoples and civilizations, and the history of the newcomer Seljuk Turks, Ottoman Turks, and other Turkic-speaking nations of the Caucasus, Central Asia, Russia, China, Afghanistan, and Iran are linked by fabricated historical accounts, which have a political motivation, often devoid of any scientific and realistic merit. The idea is to establish the historical continuity of the Turkish race in this region, from antiquity right down to the present. The Turkish Historical Society even today is claiming that the ancient people of Uratu, Hittite Elam, Akad, Sumer, Chaldea and Cimmerian are all Turanian or of Turkic origin, and therefore the Turks' forefathers would have been the original inhabitants of Asia Minor, Middle and Near East from the time of antiquity. According to the Turkish Historical Society; Eastern Anatolia is not the original homeland of the Armenians, as Armenians claim. The Turks are claiming that Armenians did not originate in Anatolia, nor did they live there for four thousand years, as claimed; they (Armenians) have put forward these ideas merely to support their claims that the Turks drove them out of a homeland in which they lived for thousands of years. FALSE CLAIMS Ahmet Esat Uras, the father of Turkish revisionist history, claims that Armenia is a geographical name given to the region by foreigners. Armenians call themselves Hay and their country Hayastan; they adopted the name of Armenia because they settled in this geographical area from the beginning of 521, migrating from the West, and then later were called Armenians. The Azeri Turks have also invented similar revisionist narration. According to the late Azeri historian Ziya Buinyatov, The original inhabitants of Karabagh are Christianized Azeri Turks, forcefully assimilated by the Armenian occupiers centuries ago, all khatchkars and churches were built by Christian Azeris. What blasphemy to our ancestors! For the knowledgeable reader, none of these assertions can make any sense. Obviously, these assertions are unscientific propagandist fabrications. But the real issue here is the degree of falsification that has become the official policy of Turkish academia, The Turkish Historical Society, and their counterpart in Baku, the Azeri Academy of Science's History Department. ERRONEOUS ASSERTIONS The assertions are as follows: 1) The present territories under the sovereignty of the Republic of Turkey and Azerbaijan from antiquity until today have always been inhabited by Turks. 2) Armenians are newcomers, they never had sovereignty in these territories, nor did they have an established sovereign state. The Armenian nation was always controlled by the Romans, Persians, Byzantines, and Arabs. The Turks took Anatolia and the Caucasus from Byzantium, Memluk Arabs, and Iranians; therefore, the Armenians' claim that the Turks forcefully took these lands from them is unfounded. 3) Armenians were well treated by the Turks: they (Armenians) took advantage of Turkish hospitality and prospered economically at the expense of Turks, yet they formed a fifth column and collaborated with the enemy of the Turkish state (Russia). In order to claim Turkish lands, they formed revolutionary organizations and conducted insurrections endangering the security of the Turkish and Azeri states. 4) The 600,000 Armenian and 3 million Turkish deaths were the result of a civil war between Turkish defenders and rebellious Armenians during WWI. (The Turkish casualties were a direct result of war between Turks, Russians, British, Arabs and Allies in different war zones, not as a result of civil war - M.A.). The Ottoman state and the Azeri state took preventive measures to deport Armenians from war zones for state security reasons, and took extra measures to protect the Armenian deportees but, because of weather conditions and disease, some of them perished. The Armenian allegations that the Ottoman state preplanned the Armenian deportations before the war is false; the state did its best to protect the Armenians. 5) The treaties of Gumri, Moscow, Kars, and Lausanne finalized the Turkish-Armenian border and Azeri-Armenian border as well. The Armenians claimed that the Turkish and Azeri territories revealed their expansionist designs to create Greater Armenia. INTERNAL & EXTERNAL AGENDAS Both the Turkish and Azeri Historical Society are state sponsored, and their academicians are faithfully following their official government policy. On the internal front, the task is to create unity, national philosophical and ideological uniformity, self-confidence and self-esteem, and teaching the glory of Turkish Empire as a law-abiding state, promoting culture, equality, and social justice to all its all subjects. On the external front, their goal is to establish the legitimacy of the Turkish state, by trying to prove that they have existed from ancient times down to the modern era, on the presently existing Turkish territories. According to the Turks, this proves that the Armenian allegations are false and their claims to these territories unfounded, since there is no historical, cultural, or legal basis at all. The Armenians are guilty of committing atrocities against Turkish and Azeri civilians, and are responsible for their own demise, due to their treacherous conduct during WWI. According to the Turks, the war in Karabagh and the Armenian aggression against Azerbaijan is another example of Armenian treachery. The numbers of illustrated academic papers, articles, publications, and books from the Turkish and Azeri Historical Societies are astonishing. After this comprehensive and brief review of the work, conduct and objectives of the Turkish and Azeri academicians and historical societies, it would be very doing, and where are we in this battle to have the historical facts and realities prevail over the falsifications, fabrications, and revisions? WHAT ARE WE DOING? The answer is that we are doing very little. Instead of complaining about mushrooming chairs of Turkish History throughout the nation, we should pay attention to improving the quality, productivity, and efficiency of the existing Armenian chairs. Most of the Armenian chairs are dormant, their publications are few in number, and academic seminars and conferences are very seldom held. Furthermore, information sharing among Armenian academicians is scarce due to lack of funds and the perennial absence of coordination. Also, the subjects being studied will not meet today's requirements. The old issues that need to be studied are those whereby the Turks' interpretation and falsification of Armenian and Turkish history can be refuted. The contemporary issues are the New Middle East and New Geopolitics, New Great Game and Oil Pipeline Politics, New Energy Sources and Great Power Rivalries in the Caucasus and Central Asia, Pan-Turkism, and the Role of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. Prevention of genocide and the recognition of the Armenian Genocide are also serious issues. Building democracy and market-oriented economy in the former Soviet republics, the development of a law-abiding society, the prevention of economic crimes in the newly independent states, conflict resolution and prevention of ethnic confrontations based on justice and historical rights are the issues that are at hand, which the academicians should work for. ANI (Armenian National Institute) could be the forum in this new millennium, where the most able Armenian historians and academicians from Armenia, Nagorno-Karabagh, and the Diaspora can gather together to exchange ideas for nation building. The greatest tribute for our martyrs would be to achieve success in building a democratic, prosperous, and united Armenia for our children, free of foreign domination, corruption, poverty, social ills, and disunity. It is the duty of intellectuals to search for avenues to resolve outstanding unresolved national issues, cure social and economic ills, and enhance the security and prosperity of newborn Armenia and NKR.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-10-10,0
"Jewish-American Organizations Urge Repeal of Section 907 As reported in last week's issue, the House Appropriations Committee, on September 10, voted 30-19 to repeal Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Five Jewish-American organizations supported that action and wrote a joint letter, dated September 1, to both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Appropriations Committee, urging Section 907's repeal. The following is the text of that joint letter. The Honorable Bob Livingston Chairman, Committee on Appropriations The Honorable David R. Obey Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations United States House of Representatives Washington, DC 20510 Dear Chairman Livingston and Representative Obey: The undersigned organizations support eliminating Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. In brief, we believe this is good for the United States, good for regional stability in the Caucasus and Central Asia and good for Israel. Natural resources of the Caspian Basin will supply a major portion of the world's energy in the 21st century. We believe there is a direct link between the health of the world economy and ensuring the safest and the least costly method of delivering petroleum and natural gas. However, a consortium of companies and producer countries will have the last word on which of several proposed pipeline projects in chosen. As long as Section 907 remains in place, it is a deterrent to the international investment needed to create the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, the natural gateway for transporting Caspian Basin hydrocarbons to the west. Encouraging investment and confidence in Azerbaijan will therefore contribute to stability in a strategically vital region and borders Russia, Iran, China and Afghanistan, and that has growing economic and social ties with India and Pakistan. Moreover, we believe that lifting Section 907 is an important component of an overall U.S. strategy for the region. The emergency of eight new nations in the Caucasus and Central Asia presents a unique opportunity to the United States to help shape the destiny of a region that is crucial because of its location, the natural resources it offers, and the rich heritage of its diverse people. We are confident that genuine independence, peace, and prosperity for the nations of the southern Caucasus and Central Asia will benefit the national interests of the United States and of Turkey and Israel, as well as other regional allies. The recent nuclear competition in India and Pakistan, and Taliban victories in Afghanistan, only underlines [sic] how important this region is as a potentially stable buffer. It is critical that parties that expect to profit from a chaotic and underdeveloped southern Caucasus and Central Asia understand that the Western democracies and the United States oppose their goals. In supporting this measure, we are also confident that the legislation's implementation will improve the lives of the tens of thousands of Jews who live in these countries. Georgia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have significant Jewish populations, and the latter three are countries with Muslim majorities that, nevertheless, have good relations with Israel and provide models for the Islamic world of the benefits of trade and commercial activity with the Jewish state. The Jewish communities of Azerbaijan and the Kyrgyz Republic have written asking that Section 907 be lifted. These letters are attached. Iran remains, despite the election of Mohammad Khatemi as the president, the single greatest threat to the security of this region. Facilitating Western involvement and investment in the energy-rich Caspian basin and adjoining Caucasus will also serve the United States' strategic Interest by channeling energy dollars away from Iran. We feel strongly that it may also facilitate direct negotiations between the parties to settle differences over Nagorno Karabagh. Accordingly, we again urge you support lifting Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Thank you for your consideration of our views. Sincerely David A.

"Jewish Community of Armenia Protests Jewish-American Organization's Appeal to Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Appropriations Committee for Repeal of Section 907 The following is the text of a letter, dated September 15, which the Jewish community of Armenia sent to the Jewish-American organizations which called for the repeal of Section 907. The letter of the Jewish Community of Armenia expresses its alarm and explains the impact of the repeal of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act on themselves and other Armenians. This letter explains the Armenian-Jewish perspective, particularly noting the increased security threat the people of Armenia would face if this legislation were upheld by the full House. Dear Gentlemen: The Jewish community of Armenia, which has deep historical roots in the country, is proud of its excellent relations with Armenians. Together we have experienced great joys and sorrows. Together we survived the devastating 1988 earthquake. Together we fought for independence from the Soviet Union. Together we are rising to the challenge of converting to a democratic market-economy. And together we are suffering through the effects of the blockade imposed by Azerbaijan on Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. Azerbaijan's 9-year total blockade of Armenia has impeded a great deal of trade and transport of goods to Armenia. During Soviet times, 85% of goods reached Armenia via transit through Azerbaijan. We no longer receive any goods from Azerbaijan or father east. Our primary natural gas pipeline passes through Azerbaijan. We do not receive any natural gas passing through Azerbaijan. The humanitarian aid crisis that has ensued as a result of Azerbaijan's cruel and inhumane blockade against Armenians dramatically affects our community as well. In July of this year, the president of the Jewish Community of Armenia, Rimma Varzhapetyan, visited Chicago, where she spoke at the Chicago Action for Soviet Jewry. During that time she described in detail the devastation that has affected our community as well as the Armenian community as a result of the blockades by Azerbaijan. We follow closely developments in the US Congress regarding Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. This law, enacted in 1992, was put into effect to withhold some US assistance from Azerbaijan for violating US law and to force it to stop blockading Armenia. Azerbaijan has not stopped its blockade of Armenia and continues to mock US law. We were appalled to learn that this year the US Congress, whom we consider to be international defenders of human rights, was actually considering repealing Section 907. We support the development of a new Silk Road in this part of the world. However, it cannot be at the expense of our Jewish community and our Armenian neighbors. Encouraging investment and confidence in this region is crucial to the future. It should not be at our expense. Finally, removal of Section 907 will in no way guarantee regional stability, economic stability or peace. Removal of Section 907 sanctions against Azerbaijan will, however, reward Azerbaijan for breaking US law and causing unimaginable suffering on the population of Armenia. Your September 1 letter to Chairman Livingston and Representative Obey noted that we are confident that the legislation's implementation will improve the lives of the tens of thousands of Jews that live in these countries... We beg to differ. The lives of the members of the Jewish community of Armenia will not improve. Your letter also noted that three countries in the region - Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan - have Muslim minorities. We would also like to note, for the record, that Armenia, a Christian nation with a Jewish minority, is bordered by four countries, three of which are Muslim. Two of those Muslim neighbors (Azerbaijan and Turkey) are blockading Armenia. Also, for the record, the Jewish community in Armenia suffers no discrimination by Armenians. In fact, it is just the opposite - we enjoy excellent relations with our Armenian neighbors. And, we share in the devastation Azerbaijan's blockade has wrought. Your final point in your September 1 letter noted, we feel strongly that it [facilitating Western involvement and investment in the energy-rich Caspian basin and adjoining Caucasus...] may also facilitate direct negotiations between the parties to settle the differences overt Nagorno-Karabagh. We completely disagree with this statement. There is no guarantee, nor the slightest indication, that Western investment and involvement in the Caspian basin will facilitate direct negotiations between the parties to the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict. President Aliyev has said that he is against direct negotiations. Without guarantees of open borders, western investment will be used by those who control Caspian oil to impose their political goals on their neighbors. This is precisely what President Aliyev is doing. With the US government disturbingly supportive, Aliyev's oil weapon is used against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh. In the former Soviet Union, Aliyev is remembered for his days with the KGB. We do not trust him. We have no reason to believe that removal of Section 907 will facilitate direct negotiations. Furthermore, and more importantly, direct negotiations between the parties of the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict and Azerbaijan's violation of US law are unrelated. To link them is dangerous. Accordingly, we ask your support in maintaining Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. Thank you for considering our views. Sincerely, Hirsch Meer Burstein Chairman of the Jewish Religious Community of Armenia Chief Rabbi of Armenia Rimma Varzhapetyan (Feller) Chairman, The Jewish Community of Armenia Coordinator, The Jewish Agency of SOKHNUT Rouben Khurshudyan President, AIB ALEF Fund for Support of Armenian-Jewish Relations Development",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1998-09-26,0
"1997 world survey of press freedom details suppression of journalists WASHINGTON - At least 129 journalists were in prison in 24 countries at the end of 1997, and 26 journalists were murdered in the past year because of their profession, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported in a worldwide survey of press freedom conditions. The 443-page Attacks on the Press in 1997 includes detailed analyses of press freedom issues in 117 countries and six special reports. The book is the annual report of the New York-based CPJ, an independent, non-profit organization that works on behalf of journalists around the world. The most disturbing trend of 1997, according to the CPJ, was the brutal suppression of Nigeria's struggling independent media by Gen. Sani Abacha, who was holding 17 journalists in prison, including Christine Anyanwu, recipient of CPJ's 1997 International Press Freedom Award and the 1998 UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize. Turkey released 40 journalists from prison during the year, but still held at least 29 journalists in jail, more than any other country. Ethiopia was holding 16 journalists in prison at the end of 1997, breaking its public pledge to stop the suppression of independent media outlets. At least 26 journalists were killed in 14 countries during the year, according to the report, including seven in India and four in Colombia. A 10-year chart in the book details the 474 murders of journalists by region and country. In Mexico, where three journalists were murdered and scores more face criminal prosecution for reporting on crime and corruption, local journalists are banding together to defend themselves against legal persecution and violence. In Hong Kong the handover of sovereignty to China left journalists fearful of intimidation by Beijing and disturbed by self-censorship by publishers or local independent media outlets. In Algeria, authorities continued efforts to quash independent reporting of the country's bloody six-year civil conflict. While no journalists were killed in Algeria in 1997 - nearly 60 have been assassinated since May 1993 - journalists there still live in constant fear for their lives. In Jordan, a kingdom that portrays itself as an emerging democracy, state restrictions on independent media left press freedom hanging in the balance. CPJ documented 24 countries at year's end where journalists are in prison. There were 15 in jail in China, eight in Burma, seven in Kuwait, five each in Syria and Vietnam, and four in Peru. In addition, CPJ lists another 30 cases of journalists whose imprisonment may also be due to their professional duties - 13 in Turkey, five in China and four in the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). When journalists are murdered or brutalized, CPJ Chairman Gene Roberts writes in the book's preface, it is almost always by some government, some organization, some criminal cartel, some individual wanting to prevent the flow of embarrassing or incriminating information to the public. If the assassins learned that when they killed journalists the inevitable result was that they got more coverage, rather than less, the killings would subside. Compiled from the first-hand research of CPJ's professional staff, Attacks on the Press in 1997 is the single most authoritative, comprehensive, and up-to-date source of information on the status of press freedom around the world. The book documents in compelling detail nearly 500 attacks carried out to silence journalists and news organizations through physical assault, imprisonment, censorship and legal harassment. It also describes CPJ's action on behalf of hundreds of journalists through emergency response and fact-finding missions, personal appeals by CPJ board members and staff, grassroots efforts, diplomatic channels and media campaigns. Six special reports focus attention on areas CPJ views as leading indicators for press freedom worldwide: Turkey, Nigeria, Jordan, Mexico, Hong Kong, and Armenia and Azerbaijan. Attacks on the Press in 1997 also provides details on regional trends. Regarding Central Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union, the survey notes that despite greater freedom and the proliferation of private media, across the region news organizations are still manipulated by and subjected to pressure from governments and burgeoning business interests. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic have fostered free media climates; in some places, like Russia, new private media monoliths battle for control of the airwaves. In Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan the media remain concentrated in the hands of authoritarian rulers, yet the autocratic Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has developed a vigorous independent press that functions despite official harassment. The most alarming trend across the region remains the persistence of violence against journalists. While the overall number of killings, most of which occurred in war zones, has declined since the end of the conflicts in Tajikistan, Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia, murders and beatings of journalists in non-conflict areas have become routine in such places as the Russian Federation and Ukraine. In and around Chechnya, an epidemic of kidnappings of foreigners by armed bands seeking ransom makes it the most dangerous place for journalists assigned to the region. Beatings, death threats, detentions, bombings, arson and financial pressures have become routine means of intimidating the press across the region, notes the CPJ. In Belarus, press conditions under President Alyaksandr Lukashenka are worse than in the final years of the Soviet Union. Bosnian journalists fear crossing borders between the Serb, Croat and Muslim-controlled areas because of harassment by local police. Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic shut down 77 independent radio and television stations in July and August after announcing new, convoluted frequency licensing procedures. In Croatia, President Franjo Tudjman continued to exert pressure on independent media with hundreds of libel suits filed against them.

"Genocide Workshop Huge Success Over 150 interested participants gathered in the Armenian Cultural Building at the beginning of August for a full-day Workshop on the Armenian Genocide and its present ramifications, an event cosponsored by the Armenian Research Center of the University of Michigan-Dearborn and St. John's Armenian Church of Greater Detroit. The Workshop, the second in a series to be held all over the United States, featured Mr. Hilmar Kaiser, Dr. Gregory Goekjian, and Mr. Serop Nenejian as speakers. The large crowd was warmly welcomed by Mr. Edward Haic Korkoian, chairman of the Parish Council, who expressed the Church's desire not only to be a religious center but also to serve the intellectual and community needs of the people. Dr. Dennis R. Papazian, director of the Knights of Vartan-supported Armenian Research Center, introduced the speakers. Mr. Hilmar Kaiser, a researcher at the prestigious European University Institute, Florence, Italy, and a native of Germany, has made a name for himself as an astute researcher on the Armenian Genocide, a writer, and an outstanding public speaker. Dr. Gregory Goekjian, a professor of English at Portland State University, who was born and raised in Cleveland, has taught and lectured in England, Germany, Italy, and at Yerevan State University in Armenia. Mr. Serop Nenejian has been a longtime activist in promoting worldwide recognition of the Armenian Genocide and in warning Americans of the insidious plan of the Turkish government to sway American public opinion by establishing a series of chairs of Turkish studies at major American universities. Not a Turkish-Armenian Issue Mr. Kaiser, in his fascinating talk, pointed out that the Armenian Question, which attracted the attention of the European powers at the end of the last century, was not only a national one involving Armenians and Turks but was at that time, and still is, an issue of universal human rights - the right to security of life, property, and the rule of law. The Armenians in the Ottoman Empire were deprived of their human rights from about the mid-1800s onwards, when the Ottoman government sent Muslim settlers from the Balkans and the Caucasus to the provinces of Asia Minor where the Armenians had lived for centuries. The object of the Ottoman government was to dilute Armenian majorities by creating a solid Muslim bloc in these areas, with the goal of strengthening central control in the Armenian districts. The Ottoman government, perhaps from a lack of resources or probably in part by design, did not provide sufficient housing, land, and implements for the newcomers. The Muslim immigrants consequently began to take what they needed by force from the Christian Armenian villagers. The Armenians, faced with the increasing violations of their property and personal security, rights guaranteed by all civilized governments, turned to the government for redress. After all, they were citizens of the Empire and had the right of government protection. Their petitions, however, were ignored and things became progressively worse. The Armenians, denied security by their own government, finally turned to the European powers for protection. Following Russo-Turkish war of 1877-1878, the Armenians went to the Berlin peace conference and asked for international guarantees for their fundamental human rights. It was at this time, Kaiser avers, that their grievances received formal international attention and recognition. The European powers told the Ottoman government that all its citizens, including the Armenians, deserved the protection of their government. The Ottomans promised reforms, but the reforms promised by the Ottoman government were never carried out. Instead, the systematic harassment and dispossession of the Armenians continued. Finally, when the Armenians resisted their unfair treatment, the government itself carried out a series of major massacres in the 1890s which continued on a smaller scale up until the revolution of 1908. Citizens Rejoice Consequently, the Ottoman Armenians rejoiced at the successful Young Turk revolution which established parliamentary rule in 1908. The Armenians gladly supported the democratic process and involved themselves in the newly elected parliament. In fact, Kaiser argued, it was the Armenians who were the true Ottomans. They wanted the system to work and all their fellow citizens to prosper. Not too surprisingly, around 30,000 Armenians in Cilicia were massacred during the reactionary counter-revolution of 1909. The full price paid by the Armenians for expecting universally recognized human rights under the constitution, however, was even higher. The government once more encouraged the Muslim settlement program in the Armenian provinces. Once more, this was done on the backs of the Armenians who saw their legal rights under the Ottoman constitution trampled by the very government which should have been guaranteeing those rights. Not surprisingly, the peace settlements after the Balkan Wars again had to address the Armenian grievances, and again a promise of reform was made. Demographic Upheaval This time, however, the European powers appeared united in their demand that the Ottoman government give equal rights to all its citizens. The Ottoman government apparently understood the changing times; since the elites of the Empire had no intention of giving Christians and even non-Turkish Muslims equal rights with the Turks, it was decided to destroy the chief object of the reforms - the Armenians. To prepare for the elimination of the Armenians, the Ottoman state instituted a process of legal and extra-legal dehumanization of Armenians which culminated in the Armenian Genocide, a genocide which transformed the crime of illegal treatment of the Empire's own citizens by their own government into a crime against humanity. In what can only be described as an attempt at a demographic revolution, the Ottoman authorities virtually wiped out the Armenians of Anatolia by deportations and massacres, tried to get rid of the Zionists in Palestine, and attempted to expel the Kurds and other non-Turkish Muslims. Finally, they began the complete destruction of the Greek communities. It was through ethnic cleansing, then, that the foundation for the new Turkish nationalist state was laid, and it was through dispossession of the Armenians that the foundation for many of today's Turkish fortunes were laid. Not an Ethnic Issue It was Turkish nationalism, and not Armenian nationalism, that inspired the Turkish nationalists not only to deny the Armenians their civil rights but eventually to exterminate them. Yet in the final analysis, insisted Mr. Kaiser, the attempt by the Turkish government to resolve the legal issue of Armenian rights by eliminating the Armenians has not succeeded. Instead, the Armenian Genocide put the Armenian Question into a sphere above and beyond the reach of Turkish governments: it is now in the realm of international law and universally recognized human rights. It is now not a Turkish-Armenian feud, nor a Turkish-Armenian academic debate, but rather a world political issue. The Genocide and the Holocaust Professor Goekjian discussed the relationship between the Armenian Genocide and the Holocaust of the Jews. He argued that whereas both were certainly genocides, we must be aware of their differences as well as their similarities. The Holocaust, he argued, emerged from a Nazi perception of Jewish over-assimilation in European society which endangered the myth of racial purity that was part of Hitler's ideology. This led to the identification and concentration of the Jews - from the ghettos, to the camps, to the gas chambers. Young Turk ideology, on the other hand, was based on the myth of pan-Turkism, a nationalistic vision of a homogeneous Turkish state which the indigenous concentrations of Armenians in Anatolia and Cilicia denied. The Turkish solution was to deport and disperse the Armenians, whose deaths left none of the death camp monuments associated with the Holocaust. It may be ironic, said Goekjian, that the concentration of Jews with genocidal intent by the Germans eventually led to the creation of the powerful nation - state of Israel, and a symbolic end to the primarily diasporic identification of the Jewish people; whereas the Armenian Genocide created a nation in exile - a people whose primary identification became diasporic. Because of our dispersal, Goekjian argued, we have no location of an authoritative voice - there are as many Armenians outside of Armenia as in Armenia - and it behooves us to do all we can to maintain a discourse about the Armenian Genocide among the nations of the world, particularly in the face of the Turkish denial, until the issue is resolved. The Armenian View of the Genocide Serop Nenejian of Portland, Oregon, discussed the development of post-Armenian Genocide actions and attitudes in the diaspora. He argued that between World War I and World War II, the Armenians became a nation in exile. They struggled to adapt to their new surroundings while maintaining an Armenian identity. In the post-World War II generation, the reality of exile settled in, and a new activism emerged, particularly with regard to the Genocide and the Armenian cause. The radical actions of some small groups of young Armenians which led to assassinations of Turkish diplomats, he suggested, were influenced by the spirit of the times. The Armenian groups resembled the Bader-Meinhof Gang and the Red Brigades in Europe and the Black Panthers in the U.S., all of whom pursued their various causes. These radical Armenian organizations sought to bring to public consciousness a recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the exposure of Turkish denial. Nenejian argued that it is important to understand this context, for although we may condemn the loss of human life, we need to realize that such extreme actions were part of a worldwide current at the time, and that recent Turkish complaints of Armenian Terrorism, which they attempt to associate with the pan-Armenian political and academic response to Turkish denial, are deliberate distortions of the truth. The Armenian Genocide and its resolution, stated Nenejian, is now squarely in the political realm. The Armenian Genocide is not an academic question. That is only a ruse devised by the Turks. It is an international question of human rights which must be resolved by those states responsible, particularly the European powers and Turkey. He called upon his listeners to respond to Turkish denial by publicly disseminating the truth and particularly by keeping public officials informed. Turkish Chairs: the Final Step Nenejian and Goekjian both discussed the recent establishment by the Turkish government of Turkish studies chairs at various American universities, a process which is still ongoing. These chairs are reserved for Turkish scholars or scholars friendly to Turkey. Although the denial of the Genocide by successive Turkish governments has been going on since just after the event itself, this new movement to give the denial academic authority is particularly dangerous and must be resisted. Armenians must become sensitized to this issue and express their strong disapproval. The participants were feted to a luncheon, where excited conversation took place, and were given a spiral-bound booklet prepared by Mr. Nenejian. This booklet contains articles by Marjorie Housepian Dobkin; the Assembly of Turkish American Associations; Israel Charny; Speros Vryonis, Jr.; Roger Smith; Robert Jay Lifton; Edward Minasian; and other valuable and useful materials.

"Rev. Mardiros Chevian, Part of Delegation Meeting with President Mubarak Amid Allegations of Discrimination Against Christians in Egypt The Rev. Fr. Mardiros Chevian was one of ten New York City Council of Churches delegation members who met with Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and other high political and religious officials in Egypt. The group, representing a number of Protestant and Orthodox denominations who form the Council, was on a five-day visit to investigate allegations of a grandscale and government-condoned policy of Christian persecution in Egypt, explained Fr. Chevian who is Canon Sacrist of St. Vartan Armenian Cathedral and Pastor of St. Gregory the Illuminator Parish of New York City. He is also the permanent representative of the Primate, Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, to the New York City Council of Churches, and was the only participant representing the Armenian-Church in the delegation. The Council is often called on to take a stand on issues - social, political etc. In this case, a small group of Coptic-Americans had asked the Council to take a stand on the issue of persecution on minorities in Egypt. The trip, which unfolded over a period of time, became more of a reality when a representative of an American Islamic organization suggested that the Council leadership have an opportunity to see for themselves and investigate the situation in Egypt before making a public statement. Formally invited by the Egyptian President, the group first met with the Coptic Union of America (not associated with the Coptic Orthodox Church), the Egyptian Consul General in New York City, the Egyptian Ambassador in Washington, DC, and American Christian human rights groups. We tried to go with an open mind, in spite of the fact that the media in America has presented a story of widespread and systematically organized persecution, noted Fr. Chevian. We informed the Egyptian leadership that we would meet with whomever they had scheduled and participate fully in the program. However, we stressed that we wanted to meet also with our own contacts. Rev. Chevian called the meeting with the Egyptian President with Whom the delegation also prayed, as informative, congenial, relaxed. To the American-Armenian priest, the President stated, We love our American-Armenian priest, the President stated, We love our Armenian community here in Egypt. They are a part of life here. They are not outsiders. Fr. Chevian termed the President's motivation for his country as the economic and political stability of Egypt. From the moment of its arrival in Egypt, the group was on a busy schedule, including meetings with Coptic Pope Shenouda; the Grand Imam of El Azhar Sheik Said Tantowi; the Minister of Economy, Dr. Youssef Boutros Ghali; the Armenian Primate of Egypt, Archbishop Zaven Chinchinian; the Anglican Primate of Egypt and Northern Africa, Bishop Malik; the President of the Protestant Union of Egypt; the U.S. Ambassador to Egypt; and a number of human-rights monitotrs. The delegation also had the opportunity to meet with those in the academic community through their participation in a seminar organized by the Ain Shans University in Cairo. NO GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED PERSECUTION We were informed by the officials of the U.S. Embassy that there is intolerance, discrimination and incidents of violence in villages and the outskirts, but that it is not the policy of the Egyptian government or of the leadership of the Islamic organization. It is rather a policy of the extremist Muslims and a question of the native Egyptians (Copts who were in Egypt before the Arabs came) vs. Arab Egyptians, said Fr. Chevian, who was instrumental in the group meeting with non-Coptic Christians - Anglicans, Protestants and Armenians. As a result of his persistence, arrangements were made to meet, among others, Archbishop Zaven Chinchinian, who prior to becoming Primate of Egypt, was Canon Sacrist of St. Vartan Cathedral under Archbishop Torkom Manoogian. Speaking in fluent English, Archbishop Chinchinian made a great impression on the group. He was open and sincere and knew the right ecumenical vocabulary in expressing himself, recalled Fr. Chevian. When I entered the courtyard of the Armenian Cathedral, I felt that I was in a little Armenia in this Muslim Arab nation, in a quiet and peaceful corner in the noisy and crowded city of Cairo. It is walled, like a smaller version of the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem. I went into the chapel dedicated to the Armenian Martyrs of the Genocide of 1915 and lit a candle, the Armenian priest said poignantly. In this Coptic-Arab conflict, as in conflicts in other countries of the Middle East, the Armenians have managed to stay apart from it, he observed. In Egypt, there are only about 6,000 Armenians left (mostly businessmen and professionals living in Cairo and Alexandria), out of historic population that greatly exceeded the number. Most left during the Abdel Nasser period for economic and political reasons when private businesses were nationalized. Today, there are two Armenian churches and four Armenian schools in Egypt. Several times, Fr. Chevian was told by Egyptians, including many high officials, that the Armenian schools are among the finest in the country, and Armenian professionals are among the best. While there is no persecution of Armenians and Protestants either, Christians in general are not allowed to hold the highest-ranking positions in the army, and their representation in government is minimal. There is also some discrimination in educational opportunities. Nonetheless, Christians, including the Coptic Orthodox, fully display their Christian symbols in homes, stores and businesses. And in discussions with Fr. Chevian and other visiting clergy, they stressed that they prefer to solve their problems themselves. They even indicated that those Copts now living in United States, whom they felt had allowed strange friends with obvious political interests to encourage and support them financially and otherwise, did more harm than good to the situation of Coptic Christian in Egypt. They clearly stated that any sanctions imposed by the United States government on Egypt would make their life more difficult and upset any of the positive steps that are being taken to improve the situation, Fr. Chevian reported with refreshing candor. This point was brought but also during a press conference following the trip, with the delegation members present. ROOT OF PROBLEM IS ECONOMIC, NOT RELIGIOUS I believe that the root of this problem is not religious, but economic and social. The issue is one of tremendous poverty, the perceptive priest stated without hesitation. Life in Egypt is out of control, though the government is trying to bring it under control. This has led to much social and economic fragmentation and division. This has fueled the political agenda of extremist Muslims who further divide the society. One wonders why this attention has been focused on Egypt, when there is much more grievous discrimination and persecution and government-condoned violence against ethnic or religious minorities in countries like Turkey and Azerbaijan, Fr. Chevian said. Park of the Egyptian problem lies in the fact that disgruntled Copts who fled Egypt during previous administrations when there was heavy persecution of Christians, brought their emotional and political baggage with them. He also put blame on the American media which, he said, likes to label conflicts simplistically as having religious roots - Ireland, the Middle East, Armenia-Azerbaijan, etc. We should not look for a religious basis to every conflict; instead, we should seek to identify the economic, cultural, social roots of the problem. Whenever we saw slums, they wee primarily inhabited by Muslims, whereas many of the Coptic citizens were shopkeepers and well-educated professionals - dentists, doctors, accountants, businessmen. There has been persecution, discrimination, inequality and oppression in decades before and even how in all countries, including the United States, he continued, pointing out the recent burning of Black-American churches, and the anti-Muslim and Arab stereotypes on television and in Hollywood films. Immediately after the Oklahoma City Bombing, you will recall, the media blamed it on Arab terrorists' without waiting for the facts to come out, he said, with his typical honesty. During their five-day stay in Egypt, the New York City Council of Churches delegation also had the opportunity to visit the great pyramids outside Cairo and the tombs and other historic sites of Luxor for a day. As a result of the massacre of more than 60 tourists in Luxor not long ago by extremist Moslems, the group was heavily guarded, always traveling with two trucks filled with soldiers with machine guns in front and in back of their convoy. At their hotel, their rooms were listed under National Defense. Even at the Armenian church headquarters, there was an armed guard just outside the entrance. In spite of this, the visit was an eye-opening experience to a land of warm, hospitable people, with a rich and ancient heritage. It was good that we were able to investigate the problem ourselves, even if it was for only a short time. It strengthens my belief that one has to penetrate below media hype and stereotypes, the reflective priest concluded definitively.

"Armenians Must Take The Lead In Reconciliation With Turks, Meeting Told An evening of decided contrasts left some of the audience bewildered when, on the one hand, it was told of how methodically the Turks had followed up to complete their genocide and, on the other, that reconciliation with the Turks is possible if the Armenian take the initiative. Although sponsored by the Committee for the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide, which gives the impression that there is a political agenda somewhere, the meeting heard both speakers decry any political motives. Speaking on the subject of The absorption of Armenian women and children into Muslim households as a functional component of the Armenian Genocide, Dr Ara Sarafian presented disturbing and unsettling fact after disturbing and unsettling fact. Using information that he has unearthed, this amazing young historian put paid to any possible defense that the Turks may have that there was no organized Genocide. He presented evidence that after destroying Armenian communities, the Turks sought out and actively implemented a program of absorbing into Muslim households any women and children who survived. This, Sarafian was able to declare, is Genocide by forced assimilation. The Turkish program started in June 1915 and probably absorbed upwards of 100,000 women and children who were forced to convert to Islam before going into Turkish families. He quoted instance after instance, with communities and numbers, of the Turkish state's organization of the assimilation program. Sarafian's talk was sandwiched between an illustrated talk by Dr. Andrew Palmer, who is a lecturer in Eastern Christianity at the School of Oriental and Asiatic Studies. This unusual approach came as a result of a faulty projector and provided a bizarre evening for the audience. Palmer related his experiences en route to and from a visit to the Museum of Martyrs at the Armenian Church at Derez-Zor in 1997. While the travelogue was interesting, it was his comments that astounded. Speaking not as a politician but as a teacher of religion, Palmer suggested that Perhaps reconciliation must start with the victims! This novel solution to the conflict between the Armenians and the Turks suggests that it is ready to take its place with The victim is the cause of his own suffering. Although believing that the Turks must recognize the Genocide and would be the better for it, Palmer seemed to believe that the Armenians must make it easy for the Turks. He didn't go so far as to suggest that the Armenian apologize for causing the Turks so much distress and trouble in getting themselves killed but, frankly, the mind couldn't help wander in that direction. It was as if he was oblivious to the barrenness of the former Armenian communities that his slides depicted, or the worn inscriptions on the rubble of churches and other Armenian buildings that he photographed. However, disturbing the information that Sarafian gave, it was a relief to have his common sense and facts. After his literary of evidence, Sarafian, who also maintained that he had no political intent, returned to a theme that he has espoused often: the need for more people to do more original research. Sarafian estimates that probably ninety percent of what exists has still to be unearthed. He called for more funding for the original research, but he created quite a stir in his audience when he declared that he had no faith in the universities as being where this research would be coming from. At one point in the question period, the situation became so heated that the moderator, Razmik Panossian, had to cut off speakers, especially when Palmer was put under pressure. Nothing was accomplished toward getting the recognition of the Armenian Genocide.!","Kevorkian, Andrew",Armenian Reporter International,1998-06-06,0
"New Era and New World - Part I of III On April 24, 1965, the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, the people of Armenian began a gigantic and spontaneous public demonstration in Yerevan, demanding recognition of the genocide, financial compensation, and return of the occupied Armenian lands. It was the beginning of a collective leadership era of Aleksey Kosygin and Leonid Brezhnev, succeeding ousted Nikita Khrushchev. The people were screaming, We want our land. As a result, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia Iakov Zarobian was dismissed. This was the beginning of a national awakening, which culminated with the Karabagh movement 25 years later. At the time, the Turkish news media gave heavy news coverage about Armenian unrest. The Turks began to compare these nationalistic outbursts with the events of 1896-1923. Some papers, like Hurriyet, Cumhuriyet, and Milliyet, conducted interviews with Simon Vratzian, the last prime minister of the First Republic of Armenia. In addition, they were filled with provocative articles and even display ed pictures of the Armenian revolutionaries from 1908-1920. ANTI-ARMENIAN SENTIMENT These events or, more accurately, the Turkish media's coverage thereof created new anti-Armenian sentiment. Once more, the Turks became very sensitive about Armenian-related issues, accusing Armenians of making territorial demands. Falsification of Armenian history and the denial of the Armenian genocide gained new momentum, spearheaded by the Turkish National Historical Society under the auspices of the government of Turkey. Everything with an Armenian past was hated and denied. The official Turkish policy was: Armenians never existed in this territory; they never had a state. Armenian historical monuments were either presented as Turkish monuments, intentionally allowed to decay, or destroyed. Now the Turks began to ignore their commitment, as specified in the Treaty of Lausanne. They placed man-made hardships on the Armenians and began to impose cultural and religious restrictions. The Turks felt insecure about their territorial integrity. They were aware that to change the demography of occupied territory by ethnic cleansing and deportation is against the UN charter. The events of 1915-1923 certainly were violations of international law by any criteria. After the Armenian demonstrations in Yerevan and in the various diasporan centers, the Turks exhibited more paranoia about Armenian claims. POLICY OF MUTUAL NON-INTERFERENCE In every Turkish-USSR summit, when the leaders of both countries met, Turks demanded that the Soviet Union officially confirm that they have no territorial demands from Turkey. There was an unwritten understanding at that time between the Soviets and Turks that the Russians would not stir trouble for them with Armenian and Kurdish issues, and that the Turks, in turn, would not be involved in the affairs of Turkic-speaking regions of the USSR. On the Istanbul University campus, students used to discuss the current events. There were obvious political groupings and deep divisions among students which became more severe after the May 27, 1960 coup d'etat. After the Celal Bayar and Adnan Menderes regime was deposed, the military started to spread false gossip that Menderes was about to visit Moscow, with the intention of returning Kars and Ardahan to Russia. There was polarization in the country between the supporters of the deposed regime and the military. According to rumors, the US was displeased with the Turkish-Russian rapprochement. Some were even suggesting American complicity in the coup d'etat. MILITARY IS REAL POWER After the May 27, 1960 revolution, the Turkish military was the real power. The 28 military officers, without the participation of the general populace, intellectuals, or political parties, carried out the revolution, which inflicted a heavy blow on democracy. Then the political trials began. The National Unity Committee was formed and they tried to impose their brand of political and economic reform, but the political and social divisions, and polarization of the society got worse. The students on the Istanbul University campus also were divided. Those from large cities and those of Kurdish extraction were mostly left wing, while the students from small towns in central and southeastern anatolia were mostly right wing. The daily topic was democracy, dictatorship, religious fundamentalism, human rights, the Turkish-Greek dispute over Cyprus, and Kurdish separatism. Several students were angry, complaining As if we didn't have enough problems with corrupt politicians, Greeks, Kurds, and Russians, now the Armenians are causing us trouble. All the former members of parliament and government were exiled to the remote Yassiada islands, and political trials began. THE DUST FINALLY SETTLES About a year later, the dust settled. Life on the university campus was beautiful. I had many good Turkish friends. If you have a good government that doesn't sow dissent among people and doesn't discriminate against its citizens according to their religious, ethnic, and racial background, people can just get along fine. My friends were from many different parts of the country; they came from Kars, Erzurum, Van Sivas, Ordu Urfa, Adana, and Sinop. We got along just fine, studying, eating and having a good time together. There were many Turkish girls in our classes, and quite a few of them were beautiful. Turan and Ayhan were very attractive, smart, and industrious. They knew I was Armenian, but they didn't mind. However, there were also students with extremist views who used to make me feel very uncomfortable. During class breaks, the left-wing and right-wing students began arguments. Kasim, from Trebizond, started to criticize the government on account of human-rights violations. He said, We didn't make the 1960 revolution to replace one master with another. Look around, see how they are suppressing people with leftist ideology, and you still call our system a democracy? Mehmet Ali, a medical student from the military academy, replied, You want to give power to the servants of Moscow, those so-called progressives - the Jews, Kurds, and seeds of the Armenians and Greeks, they are all infidels. MANY EXTREMIST VIEWS Then the subject changed to the Arab-Israeli dispute. The Turks were very hostile toward the Jews, accusing them of violating the right of the Palestinians, occupying the Muslim Arab land, and committing genocide. The right-wing students went even further. Adolf Hitler had the right idea, they screamed, alluding to the extermination of the Jews in Nazi-occupied areas. I felt a kinship with the long-suffering Jews and said, What about human rights, human dignity, love and brotherhood among mankind? How can you condone the murder of human beings? Hayri, although a bully from Adana, was impartial and, looking at me, said the truth, You have humanitarian views, but didn't we treat the Armenians the same way? Are you going to tell me that we were wrong? Suddenly, I felt that I was really an alien in this society in which I grew up. How many more insults can one take? I mulled over. Being Armenian was like being from a different planet. Sometimes you have to hide your identity, sometimes you are forced to accept ideas that are so contrary to your way of thinking. NICE KIDS, WRONG UPBRINGING They were all basically nice kids, but their upbringing was wrong. As long as militaristic, chauvinistic, racist, and nationalistic military rulers govern this country and tell people what form or system of government and ideology they can have, what kind of aspirations and philosophy they can develop, and what kind of life they can pursue, this country will never have a true democracy, based on human rights and personal freedom. One spring day we were strolling on campus. It was a beautiful day, the trees were flowering, the tulips were budding, and we were getting ready for final examinations. Suddenly my close friend Haydar from Kirkuk, Iraq, ran toward me, gave me a hug, and exuberantly said, My friend, you are Armenian. I saw your father's name on your application; his name is Vartan. This is an Armenian name, isn't it. Yes, I answered. He continued, I am a Kurd. My mother's side has Armenian blood. I pulled him to the side and said, Haydar, why are you making this a federal issue? Forget about being a Kurd or Armenian. We are all Turkish citizens. NOW WE HAVE A DEMOCRACY He answered, What are you afraid of? See, now we have a democracy. I tried to terminate the conversation. Months later, Haydar was among seen other Kurdish students from Iraq, who were arrested for spreading Kurdish separatist propaganda among the Turkish Kurds. He was released from jail a year later. When I saw him in the street, I pretended that I didn't recognize him. Like St. Peter, I denied my friend. If you live in a society where you pretend to be someone that you are not, you are forced to denounce your friend, agree to things that you don't believe in, or think different than what you are forced to express, then you lose your identity. Therefore, it was time to leave the city that I loved and where I grew up. I didn't feel guilty, since even the Muslim and educated Turks were leaving for Europe. You have to have personal and intellectual freedom to prosper. The material riches I had were not a substitute for the spiritual fulfillment of being able to express your opinions, philosophy, and thought process without constraint and restraints. EXODUS BEGINS During this period, the exodus of Kurds and Turks to Europe, to find decent jobs continued. The Kurdish emigration was particularly encouraged t deflate social tension. Many Antalian Armenians also began leaving their ancestral homes; some settled in Istanbul, while others went abroad. After the anti-minority pogroms in Istanbul on Sept. 6-7, 1955, our family already made up its mind, to one day leave Istanbul and settle in North America. With many Muslim Turks and Kurds leaving the country, we thought this was the appropriate time. After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, we had some hesitation about settling in the US, but we had an invitation which we could hardly refuse. Our Turkish neighbors were curious, wanting to know why everyone wanted to leave the country. My brother replied, Certainly, we are not leaving for economic or political reasons; we are leaving for safety reasons and to have more human rights My brother's longtime Turkish friend, Dr. Suleyman, tried to convince my brother to stay, saying, Osken, you and your two brothers are physicians. Why not open a clinic together, you can make an excellent team, and I may join you. NO FUTURE FOR ARMENIANS My brother answered, Suleyman, money is not the issue. For Armenians, there is no future in Turkey. Why not face it. Suleyman was sad, for he was a real Muslim from Bulgaria. Even though he was Turk, he also lived with discrimination himself, being an immigrant. He added, Good luck to all of you, be in touch. Many of our Turkish friends tried to persuade us to stay. After all. friendship has no nationality, religion, or ethnicity. Good human beings are just good friends.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-05-30,0
"ABS Inaugurates Its New Public Gallery In New York City With The Jerusalem Project, On View Beginning May 7: Exhibition Traces the Restoration of the Dome of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher; Displays Artistic Heritage of Four Ancient Communions First built in the year 333, the Grand Rotunda of Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulcher stands on the spot where many Christians believe Jesus to have been buried and resurrected. The renovation and decoration of the rotunda's inner dome, carried out from 1994 to 1997, is the subject of the inaugural exhibition of the new Gallery at the American Bible Society, located at 1865 Broadway at 61st Street and open to the public, free of charge. The Jerusalem Project: The Dome Restoration in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, curated by Dr. Ena Heller, Director of the Gallery, will be on view from May 7 through July 2, 1998. The exhibition traces the evolution of the redesigning of the inner dome of the Holy Sepulcher by California artist A.F. Normart, documenting the various stages of the design through original sketches and computer drawings, architectural and engineering drawings, a scale model used in the final presentation, and a collection of watercolors painted as a result of the architect's many trips to the Holy Land during the renovation process. Also included in the display are artifacts and liturgical vestments and implements pertaining to Christian communities with a strong historic presence in the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, including the Armenian, Greek, Ethiopian and Coptic Orthodox Churches. The exhibition shows the richness and variety of traditions kept alive at the Holy Sepulcher, says Dr. Heller, revealing the continuity and vitality of their art and symbolism. At the same time, The Jerusalem Project offers a fascinating glimpse into the process of restoring and decorating the central space of one of the most significant buildings in the world. Objects in the exhibition are on loan from the collections of the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, The Greek Orthodox Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, St. Mary's Coptic Orthodox Church in Spring Valley, New York, the Gilman Paper Company and private collections. The artworks and artifacts include processional crosses, icons, chalices, book covers, reliquaries, and vestments. The loans are augmented by books and manuscripts from the American Bible Society Library. The showing of The Jerusalem Project in New York would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of Joyce Chorbajian, a lay member of the City's Armenian Diocese. Behind the Restoration Structural repair of the Grand Rotunda was conducted between 1970 and 1980. But for lack of an agreement between the custodians of the Church on how best to finish and decorate the dome, scaffolding remained in the cupola. In April 1994, Brother Donald Mansir, at that time vice president of the Pontifical Mission to Palestine, contacted A.F. Normart and invited him to submit a design for the inner dome. An artist and businessman based in Fresno, California, Normart traveled to Jerusalem to study the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and then was given just five weeks to prepare conceptual designs. With the aid of a computer, Normat developed a design featuring twelve golden tongues radiating as if from a sunburst at the top of the dome. The number of tongues corresponds to the number of the Apostles; each terminates in a three-point tip to suggest the Trinity. The background is painted an off-white, which becomes lighter as it rises toward the top of the dome. Rings of stars circle the dome's lower tier. Normart presented his final design (including a presentation model) at a meeting of the Catholic, Greek, and Armenian authorities at the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in August 1994. Normart recalls that the Greek Patriarch began the discussion by smiling and telling him, This is a historic occasion. We have sat down together and agreed. From that point, the work proceeded swiftly, with the assistance of a British architectural consultant and lighting design firm and an Israeli civil engineer. The restored dome was presented to church leaders and invited dignitaries at a dedication ceremony on January 2, 1997. Lecture Series In conjunction with the exhibition, the Gallery at the American Bible Society will present a lecture series on the Church of the Holy Sepulcher through the centuries. The series begins on May 8, with A.F. Normart speaking about the renovation project. On May 15, Dr. Frank Peters, Professor of History, Middle East Studies, and Religion at New York University, will speak on pilgrimages to Jerusalem during the Muslim era. On May 29, Dr. Helen Evans, Curator of Byzantine Art in the Medieval Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, will speak on the development of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher as a Christian site. On June 19, Dr. Oleg Grabar of the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, New Jersey, will speak on the medieval city of Jerusalem. The Gallery will be open to the public free of charge Mondays through Wednesdays, and Fridays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Thursdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. To is closed Sundays.

"Armenians to Dedicate Cross On Mt. Davidson Friday, April 24, 1998 Varti Vartanian's family was one among thousands of Armenian families decimated by genocide under the Ottoman Empire, and this weekend, 83 years later and half a world away, she will go to the top of Mount Davidson in search of solace. There, Vartanian and other descendants of the dead will observe the dedication of the hilltop cross as a memorial to a genocide little known to most Americans and long denied by the Ottoman Turks and their descendants. Most historians agree that a million or more Armenians died between 1915 and 1918 in an Ottoman Empire effort to purge them from an area that is now eastern Turkey. But local Turkish-American leaders, joined by the Turkish consul general in Los Angeles, insist that the genocide is a myth. And though San Francisco voters have already approved the sale of the cross to the Armenian Americans, one local leader has threatened legal action to bar the new Armenian memorial on the city's highest hill. Frustrated Armenian Americans say the threat is just the latest in an ongoing Turkish effort to expunge the genocide from history. The Turks don't allow us to mourn, they do not give us a space to mourn, says Vartanian, a senior health physicist on the Stanford University staff. But this cross will have a soothing effect on a lot of people, a whole generation. It gives respect to our loved ones who have died. As a symbol, Mount Davidson has had a varied history. The city's first sunrise Easter service was held there 75 years ago, in 1923. The 103-foot cross was erected in 1934 as a memorial to veterans of WWI. In the 1990s, it became the central symbol in legal action by the American Civil Liberties Union that challenged the city's right to maintain a religious symbol on public land. The city lost that suit, and last year it auctioned off the landmark for $26,000 to a coalition of 24 Armenian groups, the Council of Armenian-American Organizations in Northern California. Voters approved the plan in November. Last Friday, a federal judge signed the agreement that brought the legal conflict to an end. The cross will be on an island of private land in the midst of a huge public park. For most San Franciscans, I don't think the cross will have any different meaning than it ever did, says Roxanne Makasdjian, a spokeswoman for the Armenian American coalition. But for Armenians, it's how we will remember the genocide. AMPLE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE Dozens of sources, newspaper reports, diplomatic archives, the record of post-war tribunals and eyewitness accounts provide a detailed account of the horrors endured by the Christian Armenians, a minority in the largely Muslim Ottoman Empire. Exactly 83 years ago today, the Turks arrested hundreds of their political and cultural leaders and put them to death. Soon Armenians were rounded up in nearly every town and village outside of Constantinople, now Istanbul. Many of the men were killed. Women, children and the elderly were marched south into the desert toward Syria. Hundreds of thousands were murdered or died of exposure, disease and starvation. Some survived only with the help of sympathetic Turks, Kurds and others. Over the past eight decades, Armenian survivors and their descendants dispersed around the globe, while modern Turkey has built a lengthy record of torture, suppression of dissents and other human rights abuses. The battle for control of history has escalated in recent years. In the 1970s and early '80s, Armenian extremists pressed their grievances violently, killing more than 30 Turkish diplomats and others worldwide, including three in California. At the same time, the United Nations, the European Union and lawmakers from Belgium to California have affirmed that the Ottoman Turks were responsible for the genocide. Turkey, joined by a small group of historians, has pressed its own interpretation of history. There isn't a single historical document that proves the Ottoman government had a policy of exterminating the Armenians, says Aydan Kutay, director of the Federation of Turkish-American Associations chapter in San Francisco. What happened was a series of massacres - reciprocal massacres, said Hayri-Hayret Yalav, the Turkish consul general in Los Angeles. Maybe we committed more than they did, but it was not a genocide. The Turkish American Association of California has argued that Turkish deaths of 2.5 million significantly exceed the Armenian deaths estimated at 600,000. For many mainstream scholars, such arguments are comparable to those advanced by extremists who deny the Jewish genocide at the hands of Nazi Germany. The controversy has extended into some of America's most prestigious universities. The Turkish government has offered millions of dollars to hire scholars in Turkish culture and history, provided the scholars meet their standards. PETITION BY SCHOLARS A hundred prominent intellectuals and scholars, including Susan Sontag, Norman Mailer and Arthur Miller, have signed a petition condemning the Turkish government's denial of the Armenian genocide and scholarly corruption. The University of California at Los Angeles faced intense controversy last year before rejecting a $1 million offer from the Turkish government. UC Berkeley last year asked the Turkish government. UC Berkeley last year asked the Turkish government for a $750,000 grant, but with opposition mounting, the university modified its request. Now UC officials believe it will be rejected. The fight over the Mount Davidson cross has been a microcosm of the larger historical fight. For example, Stanford University officials were alarmed when a group calling itself the Center for Scholars in Historical Accuracy, Stanford Chapter advertised in several newspapers that the cross should not be made into a billboard for false advertising. No such group was registered with the university. And when Stanford officials mailed protests to the group's post office box, they received no response. The ad appeared in the Sunday Examiner and Chronicle days before the November election. Records kept by the San Francisco Newspaper Agency show the ad was faxed in by Kutay, the San Francisco Turkish-American leader. Kutay yesterday acknowledged that she sent the ad but said she did not pay for it and did not belong to the scholars group. I don't know why Stanford University should be bothered by this, she said. What will it take to end the hostilities? Dr. Krikor Soghikian, the president of the Armenian American coalition, says the Turks must acknowledge the genocide. Yalav, the Turkish consul, says Armenians must be willing too drop it. And if Armenian Americans persist in making the cross a memorial, says Kutay, they and the city should expect legal action. I don't know what they would sue us about, says Soghikian. There's no question that the genocide occurred. We're not worried about what they will do.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1998-05-02,0
"April 24th, The Kidnapping of Gulumya's Daughters, and the Armenians of Anatolia - Part III of III The 1917 Great October Revolution in all of Russia offered hope for all the central Powers. The Bolsheviks had taken control of Russia, and they published the secret agreements to partition the Ottoman Empire. The Soviet power declared, The treaty for the partition of the Ottoman Empire, which was to deprive it of Armenia, is null and void, adding after cessation of the hostilities, the Armenians will be guaranteed the right of self-determination of their political destiny. Following the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Russian troops left the Eastern Front and, once more, the Armenian remnants in Eastern Anatolia fell under the mercy of Enver's army. The Ottomans reclaimed their Eastern provinces, began the offensive in the Caucasus and started to advance toward Baku. The Azeris were jubilant, and the Pan-Turkish dreams, it seemed, were not far from realization. Being a close friend of the Hatcheryan family, Husseyin Agha came to visit them in Sivas in mid-October. He did not confess to them that he had murdered Kevork on the road, but he told Kevork's wife Gulumya, I heard that your husband was murdered by the Chechens on the road to alacahan, south of Tecev Daglari (Tedjev Mountains). What a pity, he was a nice man!. He added, Damn war, it brought havoc upon the Armenian millet (nation), all because of a handful of Armenian komitajis (revolutionaries). CONVERSATION BETWEEN HUSSEYIN & GULUMYA With her innocent look and deep-set eyes, her voice trembling, Gulumya responded, But these revolutionaries did not start the war; they were fedayeen (freedom fighters), trying to defend innocent Armenians from the Sultan's hordes and bandits in Van, Shabin Karahisar, Sasun, and Musa Dagh. Well, Husseyin replied with sarcasm, it is now too late to turn back the clock, too much water has passed under the bridge, reconciliation between the Armenian Christians and Muslim Turks is impossible now. Then he turned to Gulumya's daughters, as if in search of sexual prey, and said, Too much blood has been shed. If Armenians get the opportunity, they will avenge their losses, and I don't blame them. He then advised Gulumya to take all her belongings and two of her daughters, while leaving behind the other two, and depart for Niksar, farther to the north. Husseyin Agha, how about my little girls, Armenuhi and Maynos? Who will take care of them? I will take care of them both, replied Husseyin. Don't worry about them, you just take repika and Takuhi with you, they are much older, they can endure hardship more than these two little ones. With an assuring voice, he almost forced Gulumya to take his advice, adding My wife Ayse (Aysha) will treat them like her own; after all, we have been family friends for many years. FAMILY DIVIDED UP Gulumya Hatun took all the belongings that she could carry, along with her two daughters. Husseyin paid the money in advance to an oxcart driver named Ahmet and asked him to take them to Niksar, to the mansion of the local Muslim notable, Bazlizades, an old friends of the late Kevork Effendi. For Gulumya it was heartbreaking and devastating to part with her two little girls, Armenuhi and Maynos. They were only four and seven years old, respectively. With tears streaming down her face, in a choking voice, she begged Husseyin, Please take good care of my angels. I will be back before spring to take them with me to Niksar. Keep them safe from the wolves. It was the end of November, the roads were muddy, and the weather was getting cold. The trees had already shed their leaves, the whole plain had turned straw in color, and the blue Canik Daghlari (Janik Mountains) were visible on the horizon. Just before the mountain passes, there was the Yesilirmak River, where the town of Niksar was located. Beyond the mountain range was the Black Sea port of Ordu and Unye. From there, Gulumya was dreaming that maybe one day they would move to Istanbul. Since it was a long journey, they rationed their dark bread, dry goat cheese, and dry fruits. Ahmed had enough water with him. Now about seventy years old, Ahmed was from Kars, where he grew up with Armenians, when the province was under the administration of Imperial Russia. Ahmed was fond of Armenians; he was told once that his grandmother was Armenian and his father was Alevi Turk. He cursed the Sultan, Enver, Talat, Djemal, Moskof (Russian), Ingiliz (Englishman), Alaman (German), everyone that brought war and devastation to this land. Hatun, how old are your daughters? Ahmed asked. Takuhi is eighteen, and Repika is twelve, she answered. Their father Kevork was only forty years old, she said. They also murdered Takuhi's young husband, Armenak, their year-old son Hovhannes and two-year-old Mentzik. I heard about your husband from Husseyin and others. They said he was a very educated and wealthy man. I am also sorry for Armenak, Ahmed replied and began to sing sad Kurdish songs he had learned while he was serving in the military base in Elazig. MOVE TO NIKSAR They finally arrived in Niksar, which was crowded with refugees. Gulumya knew the town well, as before she marten years there. Her parents were the owners of hundreds of acres of fertile land, properties, and farms and, as such, were very prosperous. She was the sole inheritor of her parent's wealth in Niksar. She also inherited wealth from her late husband's ownership and properties in Sivas, but this was not the time for financial worries; rather, it was time for survival. Bazlizades gave a warm welcome to them and then gave them their parent's house, which was under the custody of Ferit Bazlizade, a friend of Gulumya's father. Gulumya soon learned the sad news that her father, brothers, uncles, and cousins also were exiled and deported, and all were murdered. The whole Armenian male population of Niksar had disappeared, only old women and children were left. The degree of anti-Armenian atrocities in Niksar was not any less than the rest of the Anatolian provinces. Ferit Bey advised Gulumya to keep quite and maintain a low profile. The war will soon be over, and we will be able to put our lives together again, he predicted. POST-WAR TRANSITIONAL PERIOD Ferit Bey was correct in his prediction. A year later, at the end of October 1918, the Ottoman Army collapsed on all fronts. Finally, on October 31, 1918 the Ottoman troops began laying down their arms, and the terms of the armistice went into effect. The Allies prepared to occupy Istanbul and the other major cities in Anatolia. Enver, Talat, and Djemal Pashas had all fled from the capital, it was reported. At the end of 1918, after the Allied fleet had cast anchor in the Bosporus, the Sultan called for a probe into the Armenian massacres, whereby a military tribunal was set up to put the war criminals on trial. Mehmed Vehib, Ali Ihsan, Halil, and Yakub Sevki Pashas, who had commended on the Eastern front, were all apprehended. Enver, Talat, and Djemal Pashas were put on trial and sentenced to death in absentia. Farther to the east, the Republic of Armenia was established. The atmosphere in Turkey had changed; for the Turks, it was a wait and see period. Ferit Bey asked Gulumya to sign papers temporarily assigning the custody of the Hacheryan estates and properties to him. She was prevented from reclaiming them later on, through legal forgery. Another Muslim notable, Namik Ali Ihsan, and his wife Fatma wanted to assume custody of Armenuhi and Maynos, and obtained consent from Gulumya to take the little girls with them to Istanbul. Namik assured her, Your daughters will receive a good education in Istanbul, don't worry. In fact, many Armenian children were taken away from their mothers during this period, raised in Muslim households, and Turkified. KEKALIST MOVEMENT PICKS UP SPEED Time went by fast. Mustafa Kemal Pasha was reported to have organized the Nationalist Congress in Sivas and Erzurum. He defied the Sultan's authority and rejected the Allied conditions. Most of the survivors of the Armenian Genocide were evacuated from the stress zones and taken to the Arab countries, France, and the US. A few Armenians were taken to Istanbul, and a few other remnants of genocide survivors tried to settle in their native towns and villages of Eastern Anatolia. One of the survivors of the genocide was Vartan Ajemian, son of a priest from Sivas. At the age of fifteen he lost his father, uncles, and relatives, and marched through Amasya and Arapkir, passing dead corpses and torched villages, hiding during the daytime and traveling at night. Finally he reached a jurdish village. Mustafa Bey adopted him as his son; he changed his name to Ibrahim and had him circumcised, Mustafa Bey taught him the craft of diamond setting and goldsmithing. Vartan finally returned to Sivas and opened a jewelry store. He met Repika through proxy and they got married in Niksar and returned to Sivas. In a few years, their family grew with the addition of three sons and two daughters. Life gradually returned to normal. The time of mourning and grief was over. In the towns and villages people began to put their shattered lives together. Takuhi also got remarried to a half-Armenian and half Turkish immigrant from the town of Kars, and they had a son. Her husband died within a year from tuberculosis. Between 1918-1920, the Turkish nationalists carried on a war of liberation in Anatolia under Mustafa Kemal. Turks and Bolsheviks simultaneously attacked the Republic of Armenia, and Armenia became a Soviet republic on November 29, 1920. The relationship between Armenians and Turks again grew tense in Anatolia. Turks now wanted to create a new Turkish identity. Inhabitants of Anatolia and Rumeli from all races and ethnic groups were now called. Turks, which meant, legally, that they were citizens of the Republic of Turkey. In essence, however, this process entailed the assimilation of minorities, forcing them to identify themselves as Turks. Henceforth, Turkey was only for Turks. It is a privilege to be called Turk, went Kemal Ataturk's slogan. GULUMYA MOVES TO ISTANBUL As life got harder, and the Armenian presence was not welcome in Anatolia, Gulumya, her property and took a boat from Samsun to Istanbul. The family had an invitation from Marseille, France, but Gulumya had good reason to choose Istanbul: her daughters, Armenuhi and Maynos, whom she had not seen in eight years, were there. After arriving in Istanbul, their intent was to build a new life. They struggled very hard, finding life in Istanbul a lot different. The dialect, customs, dress code, and social values were all new for them. What bothered Gulumya the most was the religious persecution. It took two years to settle and adapt to their new environment. Finally Gulumya felt secure enough to search for her daughters. A relative found Namik Bey's address. Obviously Namik Bey got upset; after all, the girls were now fourteen and seventeen year As old, brought up in the Muslim tradition, Turkified, and educated. Why should they be subject to such commotion and confusion? Namik Bey and his wife Fatma never thought that the Armenian dudu (old lady) would reclaim the girls. Through a proxy arrangement, the old lady would finally now have an opportunity to united with her innocent daughters, who had been taken away. She was told to pretend to be deaf and dumb, and not to exhibit any emotion. After all, they claimed, they are our daughters now, we saved their lives and educated them, gave them wealth and a good life. Why spoil their lives? Namik Bey added, Don't forget, Gulumya Hanum, it's your word against mine. I am Muslim and influential, you are Christian and no one knows you in this town. Why not be sensible? Finally Gulumya visited Namik Bey's estate in Rumeli Hissar, and ten years after their separation she saw her Armenuhi and Maynos, now called by their new names, Mubedcel and Safiye, both graceful and beautiful. The older daughter recognized her mother and her eyes welled up with tears, but she was told to stay there for only a short time. She could not understand why her mother was motionless. The younger daughter appeared to have forgotten her past. DIES OF BROKEN HEART Grandmother Gulumya died a year later, I am sure from a broken heart. I was only twelve years old then. Years later I wrote a letter to Mubedcel, telling her life story, and invited her to New York. In her reply, she wrote, I was touched by your history, and thank you for your invitation, but I am an old lady now. Maybe we are dealing with a case of mistaken identity. I have two sons; one is a general in the Turkish army, and the other is working for the foreign services. After all, you can't turn back the hands of time. She sent her picture, in which she resembled my aunt Takuhi and my mother Repika. Mubedcel, my youngest aunt, died seventeen years ago in Istanbul, and her sister, my aunt Safiye, died in Ankara two years before her death. The events of April 24th not only altered the lives of the generation of 1915, but they also affected and altered the lives of the following generations to come. The motional damage is worse than any physical damage. We must defend our cause, not for justice, but for the souls and spirits of our beloved families, who didn't deserve to die. The very least the Turks can do now, 83 years later, is apologize. Photo (Gulumya Hanum, Kevork Agha's wife.)","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-04-25,0
"April 24th, The Murder of Kevork Effendi, and the Armenians of Anatolia From Tokat, the road to Sivas climbs through low hills, then reaches a plateau with snow-topped peaks in the distance. To the south, before the village of Camlibel (Djamlebel) there is a ruined caravansary on the right side of the road just before Yildizeli. Kevork Effendi and his friend Husseyin Agha had traveled all day on horseback; both were exhausted and wanted to take refuge under the shade of an old fig tree, before continuing their journey to Sivas, which was a half-day away. They sat down and shared a loaf of bread, goat cheese, and fresh fruits, and tried to comfort each other about the recent Armenian-Turkish confrontation in Stamboul (Istanbul), where Armenian revolutionaries attempted to seize the Bank Ottoman (August 26, 1896). Husseyin tried to ease the tension, saying It is not your fault, Kevork Effendi. Why worry, you are a honest trader and a respected member of your community. Yes, Husseyin Agha, Kevork answered, I am a loyal subject, but the Sultan will not bother to distinguish a good Armenian from revolutionaries. OMINOUS SIGNS Husseyin conformed him, Kevork, do you know that Turkish revolutionaries from Ittihad ve Terakki [Committee for Union and Progress] and Armenian revolutionaries are working together to bring justice and brotherhood among the Empire's Muslim and Christian subjects? What is wrong with that? Kevork answered, This is a direct challenge to the Sultan's authority. He will take full advantage of the situation and punish the Armenian Millet (Nation). He is already frustrated with demands put forward to the Sublime Porte by the European powers, to carry out reforms in the Armenian-inhabited regions of the Eastern vilayets (provinces). Kevork Effendi, you worry too much. I feel rested now. Let's continue our journey before the dark falls, there is a long way to go yet to Sivas. Back in the city, there was tension in the air. The Armenian of Sivas already knew what had happened to the Adana Armenians: fanatics had massacred thousands of them with the tacit approval of the Sultan. Armenian notables were trying hard to ease the tension, and they were talking to Muslim notables to make sure that peace would be maintained among the communities. After all, the overwhelming majority of Armenians, almost all the Armenians of Sivas and neighboring Tokat, Kayseri, Ordu, Giresun, Erzincan, and Marash were the loyal subjects of the Ottoman Empire. Ordinary Armenians did not know much about politics; in fact, they shied away from it, since they were told politics was dangerous. The Armenians of the region were mostly farmers, cattle raisers, fruit tree growers, artisans, and traders. They were known for their hard work, loyalty, religious devotion, and family dedication. Why should the political turmoil in Stamboul affect the daily life of the people in this distant province? Armenians knew the Turkish character well. If ever a single Armenian should commit an offense against any Muslim, then all Armenians are blamed, as if it was all their fault. No matter what, the Turks were always resentful of the Armenians. The Turks believed that all Armenians were rich, lived in better house, dressed and are better, and certainly were better educated. CALM BEFORE STORM In April 1913, a year before WWI, it was Kurban Bayrami (Muslim feat of Sacrifice), and Armenian Easter which was approaching. Both the Muslim and Christian communities were ready to celebrate these two important festivities. There was an air of reconciliation, and expectations were running high that everything would get better. Husseyin Agha brought the meat of a sacrificial lamb to Kevork Effendi's house, and Kevork's wife Gulumya Hatun gave Husseyin Agha the Easter chorek (Armenian Easter bread) to give to his wife Ayse (Aysha). They sat around the mangal (charcoal brazier) and sipped hot tea. Husseyin informed Kevork that Moskof (Russians), Ingiliz (English ) and Franciz (French) were ganging up against Alaman (Germans), and Osmanli (Ottomans) may join the Alamans. Kevork Effendi was very upset. This is bad news, Husseyin, he said and added, This means war, war means death and destruction, out empire already has lost territory in the Balkans and Africa, we need peace now, not war. Husseyin answered, Don't worry. Talat, Enver, and Djemal Pashas are German educated: Germany and the Ottomans together will win the war, and Russia will be destroyed. We will expand our control over the Caucasus, Central Asia; Turkey and Turkestan will unite and we will have a common homeland for all Turks, the Greater Turan. The dream of Pan-Turkism will be realized. Poor Kevork Effendi suddenly turned pale. He almost felt like fainting; then he broke into cold sweats and sank into his divan (sofa). KEVORK SENSE DANGER Are you all right? Hisseyin asked. Then, with a loud, sarcastic laugh, he added, Don't worry, we consider Armenians Christians Turks. After all, there are many Armenians conscripts in the ottoman Army. Together we will destroy the Russians. On August 2, 19214, after World War I had already begun in Europe, a treaty of alliance was signed between the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany. On November 11, 1914, the Ottoman Empire declared a holy war against the Entente Powers, and thus the bloody chapter of the ugly war began. During a secret meeting of the Ittihad ve Tarakki Party, the Ottoman triumvirate of Talat, Enver and Djemal already decided that the war would certainly create an opportune time to pursue a final solution to the Armenian question. For this, premeditated and well-planned decision were taken to execute the deportation and mass extermination of the unwanted elements the Armenians. The first step was the transfer of the 200,000 Armenian conscripts in the Ottoman armies to labor battalions - a prelude to their extermination. This was followed on April 24, 1915 by the arrest of 300 prominent Armenian leaders in Istanbul, who were murdered on the road to exile. Then the systematic deportation of the Armenians throughout the Ottoman Empire began. The deportees were brought to the extermination centers in small groups, and special cetes (bandits and criminal groups organized by the government) began their killings. Sivas was located farther west from the Russian front in the Caucasus. Initially, it was quiet. Nevertheless there was uneasiness among the Muslim and Christian population alike. There were short-ages of sugar, tea, coffee, and oil, and the color of the bread was darker since there was a shortage of flour as well. Winter was approaching and the Ottoman Army was losing ground on the Eastern front. On December 25, 1914, the Russians beat Enver's army in the battle of Sarikamish, causing the Ottoman army to retreat. Most of the Armenian population in Kars, Erzurum, Erzincan, Mush, Bitlis, Bingol, Elazig and Malatya was deported and massacred in 1914-16, Long gone were the Armenian farmers, artisans, professionals, ironworkers, carpenters, and traders; there were none left with skills to support and maintain the retreating and demoralized Ottoman army. TENSION IN SIVAS There was hurry and worry in Sivas that Armenian volunteers under Sebastatzi Mourad Pasha and Antranig Pasha, having arrived at the gates of Erzurum, were bent on avenging the destruction of the Armenians in the Eastern provinces. Kevork Effendi was in a deep depression as he had already lost his two sons, three nephews and several of his distant relatives on the Eastern front while they were serving in Enver's army. He did not hear any news from other relatives living in Malatya, Amasya, and Samsun after their deportations. One winter night, a gendarme knocked on his door and asked him to get ready to report to the police station. He did not have time to wake up his four little daughters to say goodbuy. His voice was choked with tears, and his hands were trembling. He gave a last look at his petrified wife, who never heard from him again. On the way to the police station, along the snow-covered streets, he passed by Surp Nishan Armenian Church and, from each corner, he saw the hundreds of Armenian men being escorted in columns under the gaze of armed gendarmes. Snow flakes covered the grim and petrified faces of the deportees. The filthy language of the askers (soldiers) disturbed the serenity of the while winter night. They all realized that this was the beginning of their long death march. Their only crime was being an Armenian. Kevork Effendi suddenly felt safe when he saw his longtime friend Husseyin standing next to the police commissar, but Husseyin Agha first pretended not to see him. Later he approached Kevork and said, I will be back. Once, a native wrote, Armenia is the motherland, the cradle of humanity, and all other lands are her daughters; but she is fairer than any other. Even her mountain tops of perpetual snow are a crown of glory: the sun kisses her brow with the smile of morning, and she supplies the beautiful rivers Euphrates, Tigris, Araxes which form the jewels of the crown. Now its snow was covered with blood, its sun was shrouded with dark clouds and its beautiful rivers were filled with human corpses. The sweet fragrance of flowers was now the stench of death. The heaven was collapsed in the sky, and the earth was moving under the columns of human remnants marching to their death. The raping of Armenia was in progress; calamity and destruction were everywhere. MERCY KILLING Suddenly Kevork Effendi stopped when he heard Husseyin's voice. Husseyin felt bad, for he could barely recognize him; his eyes were sunken, his voice was inaudible, his lips were cracked, his bare hands were purplish red and swollen, and his knees were buckling. Husseyin said, Kevork Effendi, I know you are innocent and are a good man. I will take care of your wife and your four daughters, don't worry. Instead of these ignorant cetes killing you, I will promise you a dignified death. Husseyin then brandished his knife and plunged it into Kevork Effendi's heart. The Turk then moved away and asked for mercy from Mohammed for ending the misery of his longtime friend. In his Transcaucasia and Ararat narrative, James Bryce writes of Armenia and Ani: These monuments leave no doubt that the Armenians people may be included in the small number of races who show themselves susceptible of the highest culture. The Turks were afraid of the Armenian cultural and intelligence. They would rather kill it than be threatened by it. World War I ended with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire. On October 30, 1918 the Ottomans signed the Armistice of Mudros, but the Allied victory come too late for 1.5 million Armenian victims. They perished physically, but they won the final moral victory. The resurrection of the Armenian nation from death was a reminder to the perpetrators of this horrendous crime that they failed to reach their objectives. We are here to stay, and all we ask for is that your forefathers be indicated and condemned.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-04-18,0
"April 24th, and the True History of Kirkor and Armenians of Anatolia - Part I of III Once Istanbul was the home of 150.000 Armenians, concentrated mostly in the districts of Kumkapi, Samatay, Yesilkoy, Osmanbey, Ferikoy, and Kurtulus in the European part of the city, Uskudar in the Asian part of the city, and, during the summer months, Kimaliada (Hennaed) Island located in the Sea of Marmara. They were a prosperous community with thirty-five churches and dozens of schools. Armenians of Istanbul were highly cultured and educated. Their origin in the city goes back to the seventh and eighth centuries, long before the Ottomans captured the city in 1453. Previously, the name of the city had been Constantinople under the Byzantine Empire, in which Armenians used to hold important government positions, with quite a few of them later becoming emperors. Under the Ottomans, Armenians still played important roles in the arts, literature, music, architecture, and government; many of them were artisans, professionals, traders, businessmen and jewelers. Their contribution to the Ottoman state can be attested in every corner of Istanbul. FROM PROSPEROUS COMMUNITY TO ISOLATED MINORITY After the deportations and the genocide of 1915, and the pogroms of 1955, the once prosperous and influential community dwindled to the status of an isolated minority, living in uncertainly and fear. Most of the native Bolsetsies (inhabitants of Istanbul) left to go abroad, and many of them are now living in New York City, various towns in New Jersey, Boston, Los Angeles, Montreal, Toronto, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo and Sydney. As they left Istanbul, Armenians from the Eastern Anatolian towns of Malatia, Diarbekir, Marash, Sivas, and Kayseri moved in and continued to run the Armenian churches and schools to the best of their ability, despite all odds, including man-made bureaucratic obstacles. These Anatolian Armenians are a tough breed, honest, hard-working and fearless. Once the Armenian community was proud of their writers and poets, like bedros Tourian, Missak Medzarents, Yervant Odian, Hagop Baronian, Rouben Sevag, Daniel Varujan, Siamanto, and Gosdan Zarian. Now they are proud of their outspoken spokesman like Kirkor Aghbaloglu, Migirdich Margossian, and Hagop Mntzuri. STORY OF KIRKOR AGHBALOGLU During a recent Turkish radio talk show, the Turkish broadcaster wanted his countrymen to get acquainted with Kirkor Aghbaloglu's life history and experience, from his childhood to adolescence and, later, to adulthood in the city of Diarbekir. His history is the history of every Armenian, and the Turkish broadcaster wanted to be sure that his life experience could be heard by the uniformed new generation of Turks, who are intentionally kept in the dark by their government about the Armenian past. I was born in Diarbekir, our neighborhood was mixed with Turks, Turkmens, Kurds, Zazas, Yezidis, Arabs and Armenians. They used to call me `giaour' (infidel), I don't know why. During street games among neighborhood kids, sometimes we used to fight. If a Muslim kid hit me it was all right, but if I even hit one of them it was a big deal, a big sin. They would ask how come the `giaour's seed was striking the Muslim kid. Then they used to curse me, swear at me, chase me, and throw stones at me. I can't remember how many times I got hit on my back. How was your childhood? Not a very happy one. I still remember the crying voices of my grandmother and the elder ladies of our neighborhood. They remembered how their father, brother, and husband were taken away by the Turkish gendarme one dark night without any reason, and were butchered in nearby hills, valleys, mountains, or were exiled to the far-off Syrian desert, and were never returned. I could still hear the sad songs they used to sing. I could still see the tears of my grandmother and her trembling hands. By gazing into her deep-set eyes, one could see the crimes and burdens of a hundred years. Those must have been terrible times, to have been subjected to such massacres. I wouldn't call them massacres, or deportations, or civil war; it was premeditated, preplanned, and executed by the higher echelons of the Ottoman government, using special and organized criminal groups of eradicate the Armenian race. It was a genocide; the Turks wanted the Armenian land and they got it through the genocide. Why were these horrendous crimes and atrocities committed, since the Armenians were welcomed by the Turks and they used to live side by side for six centuries? Let me talk straight. We Armenians have been natives of Anatolia for four thousand years. You were the newcomers to this land; we welcomed you, we fed you, we gave you art and culture, and we taught you civilization. In every Turk's throat there is Armenian bread, and in every Turk's possession there is Armenian wealth, but today no one wants to talk about these realities. We worked, you plundered us; we toiled and you guys abused us with heavy taxes. The Ottoman government took our youth into the armies, converted them to the labor battalions, and slaughtered them systematically. I believe in pluralism and multiethnic cultures. I would like to know about the Armenian and Kurdish cultures, languages, and histories. I want to know who built these thousand monuments, who created Anatolian civilization, why the authorities are still trying to deny the glory of Armenian civilization in Anatolia. Our government calls our system a democracy, what democracy? Today you can't study Kurdish, use the Kurdish national dress, or sing Kurdish songs in public. Furthermore, they try to force you to call yourself a mountain Turk. Today, in order to go to Armenian schools, you have to prove that you are Armenian. If I am an Armenian, what is the purpose of my proving my Armenian? The reason is clear, to force me to forget my language, my religion, and my identity, in order to assimilate me. Today, in order to renovate or merely paint our schools and churches, we have to obtain permission from the directorate of wakfs (vakifs). When you ask for permission they put many man-made obstacles in front of you, because they want everything that is related to Armenians to collapse and disappear. I thought that the Treaty of Lausanne provides a guarantee for the Armenian minority to maintain their culture, religion, and language. Yes, on paper, but in reality the government encourages anti-Armenian campaigns. The Minister of Education last year called the Kurdish PKK chief. Abdullah Ocalan, a seed of the Armenian. Today the word Armenian is used for swearing, insult, and degradation. The government is spreading anti-Armenian propaganda leaflets throughout Anatolian cities, towns and villages, claiming that Armenians are pretending to be Kurds and are sowing discord between the Muslim turks and Kurds, because they want to create `Buyuk Ermenistan' (Greater Armenia) on Turkish-Kurdish land. This defamation campaign is equal to the Nazi fascist propaganda campaign. I believe this is why you left Diarbekir, isn't it? My father was a blacksmith, and a very skilled one at that. Most people in Diarbekir preferred to do business with him because he was an honest man. He worked very hard all his life and made a good name for himself. He trained many Turks and Kurds as well. There were other blacksmiths in the district, but they were not very busy, and they were always jealous of my father. They used to say to the Turks, `Why do business with that giaour, spend your money on a Muslim artisan.' In fact, they erected a wall between my father and their shop, to prevent people from coming to my father's place. When they did not succeed in their conspiracies, they begun to threaten my father's life and asked him to leave town. My father, a stubborn man, told them. `This is my ancestral land and this is my town, why should I abandon it?' When his former student Osman pulled a gun on him and asked him to evacuate his shop, my father was devastated. When he came home, he didn't talk for days. Finally, however, he broke his silence and said. I didn't anticipate this from Osman, I taught him ironwork, I fed his children, I shared my flour and bread with him, he shouldn't have done this to me. After this incident, my father died of grief, and we left Diarbekir. THOUSANDS MORE SUCH STORIES Well, this is not only the history of Kirkor, for there are thousands, if not millions, of unfold stories like this. Heartbreaking stories were passed down from one generation to the next, stories of killings, forceful separation of families, separation of husbands, wives, children, rape, death and destruction, and many shattered lives... destruction of churches, plundering of wealth and properties, deportations, mass exterminations. This was the fate of the entire Armenian nation. Every April 24th, we commemorate the day of man's inhumanity to man and remember the 1.5 million innocent victims who are still waiting for an apology. Instead, we are facing a wall of silence, justification, denial, and more hatred. The same evil nationalist and fascist forces continue the same genocidal policy even today, this time on the Kurds, and are planning the same act in Nagorno-Karabagh. It takes a man to accept his errors. An honest man accepts his mistake, whereas a crooked one tries to hide it. During his visit to South Africa, President Clinton apologized for sins committed by America, from slavery to genocide, stating We're to terribly sorry. According to the Time Magazine report, President Clinton, of course, is not the first head of state to declare remorse for historical acts. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has apologized for last century's Irish famine. And the Vatican expressed regret for not standing more strongly against anti-Semitism. We all know the Germans apologized for the Holocaust, the Japanese apologized for the atrocities they committed in China and the South Pacific. On the other hand, the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide are still committing the same acts now in the Kurdish region of Turkey, yet the whole world is mute about it. This is akin to just adding salt to our deep wounds. We are anticipating that the ANI project will soon materialize, with the building of the Armenian Genocide Museum in Washington to immortalize the victims of the Armenian Genocide, and increase the resolve of all of mankind of prevent a future genocide.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-04-11,0
"Musings Emerging From A Trip To Bulgaria, Armenia On the 16th of February, I again headed towards Armenia, this time to follow upon the social work program that I have been working on for the past 8 years, specifically the field education program that was organized during my Fulbright fellowship (1997-98). I decided to take a less expensive route ($671 round trip) - New York-Sofia, Bulgaria-Yerevan - though with some trepidation, since I was uncertain that the connections would work out. There would be a two-day layover in Sofia on the way there, and barely an hour on the way back. The New York-Sofia leg of the trip would be with Balkan Air and the Sofia-Yerevan leg, Armenian Airlines. My friend Sosi in New York offered to call friends to meet and entertain me for the two days I would be in Sofia. It seems that each time I travel to Armenia, I travel into a crisis. Last year I arrived in September and there were troops on the streets. This year the president resigned and there was political uncertainly and concern that events might take a nasty turn. Shevardnadze in Georgia had experienced assassination attempts and there were accusations by the Azeris that the Russians were planning to assassinate Aliyev. I needn't have worried. Yerevan was quiet, nearly complacent. BLACK ARMENIAN CHILDREN IN SOFIA Sofia, at least in winter, is grey and shabby. Yerevan in my memory was a more appealing place. Sosi's friends, Annie and Arpi, met me, and my first evening was spent attending a play, in Bulgarian, at the Armenian Centre. The play was a well-done amateur production, and stirred up the still smoldering ashes of Armenian loss and longing. I noticed two black children in the audience and inquired about them. It turned out that they were two of three siblings (their sister was not present) whose father was Armenian and mother was black. They attended Armenian school and spoke Armenian. Watching these children and the audience's relationship to them became more compelling than the play, which was predicable and painful to watch. What was most gratifying was the ease they appeared to feel and the general naturalness (which is different than toleration) with which people related to them. I could not imagine a similar scene in the US. Here they would have been objects of curiosity and made to feel their odarness. I wondered how long before we understand if are to survive and expand we need to consider Armenianness a large and generous concept which takes in all and any who wish to be one of us. Instead of the narrow siege mentality that dominates us and requires a limiting, constricting and impoverishing definition of who is one of us. I was at Dzidzernagapert last April 24 and, as I approached the eternal flame, a TV reporter came over to me and asked if I would answer the question, Who is an Armenian? I answered, Whoever considers himself to be one. Apparently this wasn't an interesting or acceptable answer, for he turned away in disinterest and we did not proceed to the taping stage of the interview. I must admit my ego was bruised. I thought I had said something interesting and provocative which deserved discussion. Either it wasn't or it was historically premature. Years ago in Fresno when I was a youngster, there were the beginnings of intermarriage between Armenians and non-Armenians, the latter most often women. They were taught to announce themselves, saying I'm an odar. Most people though that cute. It wasn't. Sad. Couldn't we have taught them to say that they were now part of the Armenian family instead of confirming that they were outsiders? I am sure that many of them never forgot the insult and made sure their children accepted their odar, rather than their Armenian, identity. TOO FEW TO BE EXCLUSIONARY We are too few to be so exclusionary. Just as we have enriched the culture of nations we have settled in, we need to allow the newcomers amongst us to enrich us. Accept them and acknowledge that they are part of our family. There is no need to fear a dilution of our national or racial identity. Those individuals, groups or nations that hunker down to protect some mythical basic essence will lose out in the struggle for survival. Only those who are adaptable, dynamic and able to absorb and naturalize the new will survive and flourish. I realize that the counterargument is that only by narrowing our definition to what is the core essence, the most conservative and basic elements of our culture, have we been able to maintain our existence and identity through five centuries of foreign subjugation and dominance. While this may be true, it does not follow that we must use the same methods in new circumstances. What may have been true in the past, can become a mistake if carried on in the present of future. If we do not learn to right the mistakes we commit, or those that have become mistakes through the changing of time and circumstances, we will be weakened or destroyed by them. There is no virtue in making sacred mistakes only because they are ours, familiar or traditional. ON BEING ARMENIAN AND NON-CHRISTIAN Soon after the 1988 earthquake I was sitting at dinner in Geneva and talking to a high-ranking clergyman. I asked him whether it was possible for a non-Christian to be an Armenian. This question was gnawing at me since I had heard that there were reported to be several hundred thousand Armenian Moslems living in Turkey. These were people who identified themselves as Armenian; some spoke Armenian but also announced that they were Moslems. We have always believed that any Armenian who became a Moslem also became a Turk. I had accepted this unthinkingly. But here were Moslems who refused to identify themselves as Turks. They were Armenians. The clergyman was dogmatic in his response. No Moslem could be an Armenian. No Armenian could be a Moslem. To be Armenian is to be Christian. More recently, I was talking with a local parish priest, a man who is avowedly conservative (in the best meaning of the word) and someone I respect. He too said essentially the same thing. Only he went deeper into the matter. He identified the rituals and observances of the Orthodox Church with the meaning of what is an Armenian. Of course this begs the question of what we are to make of Protestant and Catholic Armenians. And what about all those sects that have entered our community? And what are we to make of the fact that the majority of the population of Armenia are non-believers? I, for one, am not willing to exclude all of these non-Orthodox from the Armenian family. Yes, there must be room even for those Moslem Armenians and those half-Armenian, half-black youngsters, genuine room; otherwise, we will face internecine wars such as have wracked the Balkans where people of the same Slavic stock are killing each other because of religious differences (Orthodox, Catholic, Muslim). NEED TO ENLARGE DEFINITION It will take a great leap of imagination and spiritual and intellectual courage to enlarge our definition of ourselves. It will not be comfortable and it will be opposed by the most conservative (in the negative sense of the word) forces in our society. For each of us, our earliest experiences form the basis of our understanding or sense of who we are as individuals and what it means to be an Armenian. My basic sense of Armenianness has been formed by memories of life in Fresno in the late 40's and 50's, where it was church, the Armenian neighborhood with the delicious and seductive aroma of fresh pida bread at Souren's or Valley Bakery (a usual treat after church services), the egg-breaking contests in the lot facing the Asbarez Club and newspaper offices, the sand other sights, sounds and smells. My father's sense of Armenianness came from his small village of Kesrig with its unique smells, rituals and atmosphere. These memories cannot be changed, but the expectations and definitions of the present and the future must be revised because those realities no longer exist. They are romantic memories, but they are no longer actuality. They are only our inner reality. We are in a great historical process of redefining ourselves as a people. The Karabagh movement is not only about land. It is about shaking off the complexes of being victims and beggars at the tables of the masters of the world - the great powers. It is our painfully and costly won conviction that we must depend on our own strength, whether that is on the battlefield or in the cunning of diplomacy. And while this is more frightening than the illusion that there is justice in the world or that some big brother would be our protector, it is liberating yet it also places upon us a demand to shoulder the responsibilities that come with such a liberation. Everything is in movement and flux. This causes anxiety and insecurity. But this is the price of what we must do. We must come to terms with the new realities and be prepared to find a new and healthier definition of ourselves. There is no end to the need to adapt to the ever evolving circumstances of life. However, at this moment in our history, we are faced with the need for major changes. I believe we are up to it. To be worthy of this challenge each of us must examine ourselves deeply and honestly so we can make the correct decision that will affect the course of our history as a people and nation. There must be nothing that is exempt from this examination. The only thing that is sacred is our survival and regeneration. In the final reckoning, we are as great as our imagination and courage...","Moushigian, Garbis",Armenian Reporter International,1998-04-04,0
"Regarding the Presidential Elections in Armenia The election of Robert Kocharian to the office of Armenia's Presidency will send a strong signal to the international community that the Armenian nation is united, and that ties between the Mountainous Karabagh Republic and Armenia are unbreakable. Acting Foreign Minister Vartan Oskanian appropriately stated that Armenia's policy on the Nagorno-Karabagh conflict will inevitably undergo certain changes after the March 16th presidential election. The new leaders of Armenia are blaming the defeatist attitude of the previous leadership for the deadlock in the Karabagh negotiations and for creating a situation where OSCE Minsk group mediators and Azerbaijan viewed Yerevan as a party ready for one-sided concessions, without extracting similar compromises from Baku. Each one of the OSCE Minsk group's so-called mediators, due to their own commercial and geopolitical interests, preferred to ignore the legitimate aspirations of the Armenian people and totally disregarded Armenian and Mountainous Karabagh's national security and rights. During the 10th anniversary celebration of the Karabagh National Liberation movement in Stepanakert, General Alexander Lebed correctly stated, Ten years ago, the people of Karabagh resolutely and clearly declared they will not be anyone's slaves, and they vowed to live independently and according to their own laws. According to February 23rd issue of the Toronto-based The Globe and Mail, Western leaders are tripping over themselves in their haste to curry favor with the 74-year-old former KGB General Heydar Aliyev. He has been given the redcarpet treatment in Washington, Paris, and Rome... He is wined and dined by powerful Washington lobbyists such as Zbigniew Brzezinski, Brent Scowcroft, John Sununu, Richard Cheney and James Baker. The Globe and Mail then sarcastically added, But in the intense pursuit of Azerbaijan's oil, the West must now decide whether to ignore the appalling human-rights record of its government. The paper gives its answer: Today he (Aliyev) has perfected the art of exploiting the lure of profits to diminish Western criticism of his rights violations, Alleluia, we all know about Western hypocrisy in the human rights issue, and we all know that there are double standards in its use in international relations. The President of the Mountainous Karabagh Republic Arkady Ghukasian, during the 10th anniversary celebration of the national liberation struggle, stated, We have won with our own blood, sweat and strenuous efforts the right to our freedom and independence, the right to determine our own future to a better life... and lay the foundation for a sovereign state, and are prepared to defend our achievements to the last and will never again tolerate any alien yoke. PRESSING QUESTIONS Now we all should pose the following questions to our leaders in Washington: (1) Fact: Opposition groups and human rights activist in Azerbaijan are charging Heydar Aliyev with human rights violations, political oppression, arbitrary arrests of state radio, television, and news media, in order to cover up corruption within the Azeri government. Question: What is being done to improve human rights in Azerbaijan before oil pipeline projects are drafted? (2) Fact: There are thousands of political prisoners in Azeri jails. Bribery is a common practice for any commercial transactions. Azeri refugees are not allowed to settle in vacated Armenian houses for political reasons, and human lives are used for propaganda purposes; i.e., blaming Armenians for displaced persons and poor living conditions. All these horrendous acts are proof of Azeri government shortcomings and misrule. Question: What kind of actions is Washington taking to force Baku to act responsibly within internationally accepted standards? (3) Fact: The last seventy years of Armenian experience in the former Nagorno Karabagh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic within Azerbaijan have left the Armenian population very bitter and skeptical about self-rule, which was already in place under the Soviet constitution, being a part of the former Soviet Union. Self-rule did not prevent Baku's political oppression or mass deportation and massacre of the civilian Armenian population by the Azeris. Question: What guarantee will Washington have for Armenians that Azeris will not behave in the same way in the future, that their intentions and motivations are changed, and that the tragedy of Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic being emptied of its Armenian population by Communist Heydar Aliyev will not be repeated by the now nationalist Heydar Aliyev. (4) Fact: The Armenian population of Sumgait, Baku, Ganja (Kirovabad), Shahumyan, Getashen, Ardzuashen, and Kartmanki of Northern Karabagh was forcefully deported in 1988-1990. The Azeri government declared war against his own citizens in Karabagh, bombarding civilian targets with 400-600 GRAD missiles a day. If Mountainous Karabagh's Defense Forces had not defended their homeland, the entire Nagorno Karabagh would have faced a fate similar to that of Turkish Armenia, Nakhichevan, and Azeri-occupied Northern Karabagh. Question: What kind of assurance will Washington have that the repetition of a similar tragedy in Mountainous Karabagh will be prevented? (5) Fact: According to a statement made in Pakistan, Heydar Aliyev accepts the principle of self-determination for the Muslim population of Kashmir and also advocates self-determination for the Azeri-speaking minorities in Iran and the Turkish minorities in Cyprus. At the same time, he denies the same rights to Nagorno-Karabagh's Armenian majority. Question: What kind of explanation will Washington have for Azeri double standards? When these legitimate questions are asked, the standard political answers are usually evasive; they only cover the generalities, intentionally avoiding specifics. TYPICAL BUT UNSATISFACTORY RESPONSES A typical response goes like this: The United States is involved in the OSCE Minsk group-sponsored Karabagh negotiations and is trying to get all parties to the table in order to provide self rule for Karabagh Armenians within Azerbaijan, but the Karabagh leadership is refusing to accept the proposals. The Washington spokespersons then elaborate, lecturing the Armenians that the U.S. is supporting regional cooperation and conflict resolution in order to promote democracy, prosperity, and independence among the Newly Independent States, and building transportation systems for oil and gas to advance economic cooperation among the Caspian and Caucaian nations and Turkey. Armenia and Karabagh are being asked to compromise and accept Azeri sovereignty in Nagorno-Karabagh and Turkey's regional supremacy if Armenians want to be an integral part of this new world order. There are quite a few Armenians who, considering the might and power of the U.S., are genuinely convinced that Armenia and Karabagh have no choice but to obey the demands placed by Washington. Yet, the majority of Armenians believe that the might and power of the U.S. is based on the principles of human rights, self-determination, democracy, and justice. It is up to all of us to, on the one hand, expose the weaknesses of our adversaries and, on the other, the strength of our national cause. KOCHARIAN RIGHT PERSON Prime Minister and acting President of Armenia Robert Kocharian is the right person for the office of presidency. He is an honest, patriotic, dedicated, and non-partisan. He has good working relations with the Yerkrapahs (Defenders of the Fatherland), ARF, Socialists, Republicans, Ramgavars, Communists, Nationalists, and intelligentsia. He is a bridge between Armenia and Karabagh. He is hard working, a good organizer, and decisive. His leadership qualities, both in Karabagh and in Armenia, are well appreciated. He is a man of peace, a peace that is secured with strength. He will elevate Karabagh to equal-partner status in the peace negotiations in order to conduct face-to-face talks with the Azeris. Hopefully the U.S. will recognize that, along with construction plans for multiple oil pipeline routes, it is equally important to promote democracies and human rights in this troubled region. Without these fundamental values, the prosperity brought by petrol dollars may create corrupt regimes, widening the gap between the rich and poor, as we are already witnessing in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, which leads to instability and social unrest. Our experience in Latin America, from Venezuela to Chile, and in Southeastern Asia, from South Korea to Indonesia, proves that the system collapses if rapid economic development and prosperity are not accompanied by democratization and constitutional government. While targeting the bigger geo-economic picture, and new transcontinental security among the emerging Central Asian and Caucasian states, Turkey, and the West, the foreign policy makers in Washington must also pursue fundamental principles of human rights, democracy, minority rights, and self-determination in order to create stable relations between nations. Finding a just solution to the Armenian-Azeri conflict in Nagorno-Karabagh will be a step forward in the right direction. We all should support Robert Kocharian's quest to become President of Armenia, as he is a man for a just and honorable peace, which will bring unity, honesty, and good government to Armenia and the Mountainous Karabagh Republic. With a fair and honest democratic election, the people of Armenia will vote for Robert Kocharian and Karabagh.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-03-21,0
"Round two: INC president responds to accusatory ad campaign by Patrick S. McCormick For the second straight month, the president of the Irish National Caucus (INC) has issued pointed rejoinders to the Hibernian Civil Rights Coalition (HCRC). Responding to a second advertisement placed by that group in the Irish Echo newspaper, and to comments by coalition member David Lynch reported in the January issue of an Scathan, McManus declared that the HCRC is manufacturing statements ... this is a personal and vicious attack against me. The an Scathan article, which pertained to an attack launched on McManus by the coalition in the form of the aforementioned advertisement, quoted Lynch as saying that Father Sean is more concerned with where he stands in Washington than where he stands with God. The rift between the president of the INC and the Hibernian Civil Rights Coalition arose after an advertisement appeared in a December issue of the Irish Echo. In the ad, the coalition questions McManus' stance on partial term abortions. Speaking on Jan. 21 from the office of the INC in Washington, McManus not only questioned Lynch's motives, but also expressed his distress at the implication of moral prescience in the New York attorney's comment. I cannot imagine someone, anyone having the arrogance to question what is in another's heart ... to question someone's relationship with God. Personally, I would never do so. And I can't imagine anyone -- not a Catholic, not a Muslim, not a Hindu, not a Jewish person -- feeling secure enough with their own relationship with God that they would question someone else's relationship, in a public forum like a newspaper no less. McManus also said he was stunned by the vociferous nature of the attacks directed not only at him but also at Rep. Ben Gilman (R-N.Y.). You know, I think if you asked those familiar with Washington, you would see that Ben Gilman is hardly the most pro-choice politician out there. Yet for the second month in a row, the Hibernian Civil Rights Coalition has chosen to attack him, in the form of these ads. McManus revealed that he has received numerous phone calls from Irish-American groups across the nation offering support and, as well, questioning the motives of the HCRC. And there are many who have offered what I feel is now quite obvious, and that is they are attacking me to further their message. But this is not the just way to do that. And for a group who are basing their ads on a self-described moral plane ...where is the Christian morality in manufacturing untruths? While he acknowledged that he is, as president of the INC, a public figure with a certain degree of public recognition, he stated that it is the source of the onslaught that most puzzles him. I am quite surprised and taken aback with Dennis Lynch, he said. It was only a year ago that Dennis himself presented a plaque to me ... and inscribed on the plaque was `To Father Sean McManus - For service in the cause of civil rights - Go sirbhe dia duit.","McCormick, Patrick S",An Scathan,1998-02-28,0
"States Waging War Against Their Own Citizens, and State Terrorism During the 19th and 20th centuries, from South America to Asia, and from Central Europe to Africa, mankind has witnessed state-sponsored terrorism against ethnic minorities, political dissidents, and religious and racial groups, in the name of national security and unity, ethnic purity, and social harmony. The terrorism is organized by a handful of fanatic, nationalist, militarist, and racist ideologues and demagogues, filled with hatred, intolerance, prejudice, and revenge against the self-created imaginary enemy or enemies. The leaderships of these regimes have many common characteristics. They are psychopaths, exhibit antisocial and criminal behaviors, suffer from inferiority complexes and later, paradoxically, became megalomaniacs due to adulation by their cronies. They are loners and pathologic liars, and most of them were not successful at the beginning of their careers. They ascend to power during the deterioration of social and economic conditions of their countries, often preceding revolution or war. The prevailing anarchy and chaos creates the right milieu for dictatorial regimes and rulers; the people, in turn, look for a strong, authoritarian leader capable of establishing law and order, and maintaining social and economic stability. SEARCH FOR SCAPEGOATS In order to justify their arbitrary rule, or explain the cause of their country's ills, they look for a scapegoat and create an imaginary internal enemy. With well-planned propaganda and demagoguery, they create special organizations, military and police units, to eliminate unwanted ethnic or racial groups, or political opponents, through ethnic cleansing, deportations, assassinations, and terrorism. The entire operation is premeditated, well organized and planned by the higher echelons of the government, with the intention of eliminating the so-called unwanted elements. The perpetrators of state terrorism often accuse the victims of disloyalty to the state separatism, and economic exploitation of justify their crimes, or to rally popular support for their criminal acts. They conduct their crimes with secrecy, methodically destroy any proof or documentation, and blame others for lying and carrying on hostile propaganda against their country. If the proofs are overwhelming, they blame the victims for conducting uprisings and collaborating with the enemy, or attribute the deaths or casualties to inter-communal fights, civil war, disease, weather conditions, or chaotic war conditions. This was the case with the Armenian Genocide which was committed by the Ottoman Turks, as well as the Genocide of the Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians by the Nazi Germans, and later Cambodians by the Pol Pot regime. Today another genocide is unfolding in the Kurdish regions of Turkey, where since 1984 a war of attrition has cost more than 37,000 lives. In addition, what has unfolded is the devastation and torching of 5,000 Kurdish villages, the forceful deportation of two million Kurds, and the imprisonment of 15,000 Kurdish intelligentsia for their political views. The anti-Kurdish campaign is organized and planned by the highest echelon of the Turkish military and interior ministry. The clandestine paramilitary forces and death squads, paid by the Internal Security Services, are conducting state-sponsored terrorism against this ethnic population, which is a similar reminder to the operations carried out early in this century by the Ottoman special organizations and forces against ethnic Armenians, and Nazi SS storm troops against Jews, Gypsies, Poles, Ukrainians and Russians. The Kurdish war of attrition is causing polarization in the country. The social unrest, inflation, gross violation of the human rights, and military censor of the news media, radio and television, are undermining Turkey's fragile so-called democracy. Not long after election, Necmeddin Erbakan's government was forced out of office and orchestrated court proceedings banned his Islamic Refah Party. The Turkish generals, who simply made a mockery out of democracy, are now threatening the wealthy Muslim merchants, bankers, and financiers to stop their support of the followers of the Islamic Refah Party. The Turkish military's involvement with domestic disputes and party politics is undermining Turkey's credibility and causing worry among Turkey's supporters in the West, who fear Turkey is heading toward arbitrary undemocratic rule. How long the military impose will impose its will on the Turkish and Kurdish masses is difficult to predict, but historical experience in neighboring Iran during the Shah's regime proves that a strong military is not a match against popular sentiments and uprising. THE LESSON OF IRAN In Iran, the Islamic guards and the mullahs replaced the mighty military machine and the generals overnight, and Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi was forced out of power in 1979. The same kind of dictatorial communist regime in neighboring Russia, the former Soviet republics, and Eastern Europe also vanished because of the historical necessity to build democracy and society with respect to human rights. Turkey, instead of following this positive historical trend, is going backward, and its social, domestic, and political systems are deteriorating with each passing day. The 1,900 Kurds who filled three ships fleeing Turkey from ethnic and political persecution are now asking for political asylum in Italy. If the Kurdish exodus is not halted, this will not only cause political embarrassment to Ankara, but will also highlight the Kurdish plea for freedom in the European capitals. This human tragedy will set the stage for confrontation between Europe and Turkey, since the arrival of large numbers of Kurdish refugees will cause social and economic problems, especially in Germany, which is now home to two million Kurds. After the end of WWII, thousands of Jewish refugees were looking for repatriation or for countries willing to accept them; this prompted the creation of the State of Israel, with the partition of Palestine, in 1947-47. In the same context, it wouldn't be a surprise if the immigration offices of the European countries were flooded with Kurdish refugees. As a result, European countries will be forced to ask Turkey to establish a Kurdish homeland. In this issue, the Turks claim that they have no Kurdish problem in Turkey, which is not a sufficient explanation. Ankara's first mistake was to try to resolve the Kurdish problem with a military solution rather than political and social reconciliation, and grant Kurds cultural and economic autonomy. The second mistake was its participation in the anti-Iraq campaign during the Desert Storm operation in 1991 and support, albeit reluctant, of the creation of Kurdish safe zones in northern Iraq, which led to the internationalization of the Kurdish issue. The third mistake was to carry on state-sponsored terrorism against its civilian ethnic population, which shook the image of the state as the protector of its citizens. By doing so, Turkey not only alienated the Kurds but the Western educated and real devoted Muslim Turks as well. The result was polarization and alienation of the society, and loss of confidence in the establishment for not protecting the civil rights, human rights, and lives of its citizens. THE ERROR OF PAN-TURKISM The Turks were in error in 1908 when the founders of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism decided, for the first time, to create Turkey for only ethnic Turks, the direct descendants of the Central Asian nomads, and organized and planned ethnic cleansing of Anatolia from its non-Turkic population. The first stage in the plan was to exterminate and forcibly deport the Armenians, which was successfully executed between 1915-1920. The second stage of the plan was the forceful assimilation and integration of Kurds in Anatolia. The Turks then realized that the elimination of Armenians - a buffer between them and the Kurds - from Anatolia created more complications for them. The Kurdish ascendancy to economic and political power became feasible, after the Kurds acquired Armenian lands, properties, and wealth and became the masters of the region (Western Armenia). During the transition of the Turkish society in 1950's, the newly formed Democratic Party (DP), in order to challenge Ismet Inonu's Republican Party (CHP), appealed to the Kurdish voters for their support, which gave the Kurds a taste of political participation and power. The leaders of the DP, Adnan Menderes, Celal Bayar, and Refik Koralitan openly courted the Kurdish voters. The Kurds now became part of the political process: some members of the Turkish Parliament (TBMM) were of Kurdish descent; many members of the Parliament were elected by the Kurdish vote. The world changed and democratization and human rights became popular issues. Following the demise of the USSR, the creation of 15 new independent states in the territory of the former Soviet Union, and the creation of the USSR the creation of 15 new independent states in the territory of the former Yugoslav Federation, changed the political map. These changes, and the creation of the semi-autonomous Kurdish safe zone in Northern Iraq, stimulated the Kurdish aspirations for autonomy, or independence, in the Kurdish regions of Turkey. As the Kurds became more demanding of their political rights, the Turks became more oppressive, in order to eliminate any Kurdish aspirations for self-rule, autonomy, or independence. No one can say for sure how long this confrontation will last, but one thing is certain: real democratization and modernization, real peace and tranquillity will not be feasible unless the Kurdish issue is resolved. MILITARY CONFLICT A DETERRENT The proposed oil pipeline constructions in the Turkish territory also will not be feasible as long as military conflict continues among the Turks and the Kurds in the southeastern region of Anatolia. Before getting their hopes of being integrated into the oil pipeline transportation routes network too high, or planning any unnecessary concessions in the Karabagh dispute, the politicians in Yerevan must realize that the politics of the region are more complicated. Much will change in the Middle East, especially after the Iranian gesture of reconciliation with Washington and the American willingness to listen. Once natural gas is transported from Turkmenistan to Iran, the latter may become the potential oil-gas transportation route for the pipelines carrying oil from Azerbaijan and Central Asia. The problems that will alter the region's political orientation and balance of power are: 1) alienation of Arabs from the Israeli-Turkish alliance; 2) exclusion of Turkey from European Union; 3) potential conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus; 4) re-emergence of Russian nationalism, and their desire to control the former Soviet republics and their energy sources, and competition between the US and Russia to control oil pipeline routes; 5) future reconciliation between the US and Iran; 6) recognition of NKR's independence, and the end of Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist unity for good. The Turkish-Kurdish conflict will have its repercussions beyond the Turkish boundaries, which will affect the entire region, creating political instability and threatening peace. The simplistic-minded Armenians who pin their hopes on the opening of the Turkish-Armenian border for Armenia's economic prosperity, even at the expense of Karabagh's rights, should restrain their readiness to give concessions to Azeris and realize that the opening of the borders will not create miracles in Armenia. As long as the conflict in the Kurdish regions of Turkey continues, the situation will remain explosive. With its mounting social, economic, domestic, and political problems, Turkey will not be a reliable partner for years to come, not to mention their hostile attitude against Armenians. UNRESOLVED PROBLEMS As long as right-wing, racist and ultra-nationalist Turkish generals continue to interfere in Turkish domestic and political affairs, carry of the anti-Kurdish campaign and look for military solutions to the Kurdish problems, continue to monitor and control the civilian life in Turkey, and try to impose their thinking on the Turkish society, Turkey will never become a democratic or civilized society. As long as the Turkish jails are filled with political prisoners, there is arbitrary arrest of political dissidents and the physical elimination of political opponents by he death squads, which are sponsored by the interior ministry, there is censorship of news media, and human rights violations are a daily occurrence, Turkey will continue to be the Pariah State in the Middle East. Before Armenians get too exited about the Turkish-Armenian rapprochement, they should study hard about the regional politics, not only in their own backyard, but in other neighborhoods as well, and examine their problems in order to formulate and conduct a realistic policy, which will be compatible with the national interests of both Armenia and NKR. According to Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, officials from Germany, France, Greece, Italy, and Austria will meet together with senior Turkish officials to consider measures for stemming the flow of Kurdish refugees. A German government spokesman said that Bonn will await the outcome of this meeting before deciding what extra measures it will take but he did not elaborate. Before the scenario of the Vietnams boat people reoccurs, and the plea of Cuban and Haitian refugees for asylum is repeated in Europe, the Europeans will probably demand that Turkey improve its treatment of the Kurds. This is the beginning of the internationalization of the Kurdish problem.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1998-01-17,0
"1997: THE YEAR IN REVIEW; Our Churches; strides toward reconciliation Strides towards inter-confessional and intra-confessional unity and reconcilation influenced many of the religious events this year, continuing a trend evident in both Ukraine and the diaspora in recent years. The violent nature of may of the battles over church property, personal harassment, threats and beatings that were the sorrow of Ukraine's religious life several years ago have decreased markedly. Nonetheless, tensions developed, most notably within the Orthodox confession, as well as certain tensions that carried over from 1996. Tensions from previous year The issue of a visit by Pope John Paul II to Ukraine, raised in 1996, continued to meet resistance in Ukraine from Orthodox hierarchs as well as many government officials. President Leonid Kuchma met with the papal nuncio, Archbishop Antonio Franco, in Kyiv on January 22. The papal nuncio reiterated the pope's desire to visit Ukraine, and though President Kuchma praised the pope, he also spoke of the need to create appropriate conditions for a papal state visit. Patriarch Filaret of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church-Kyiv Patriarchate, after at first denouncing such a visit, in an interview on February 22, modified his stance and claimed that we would welcome [such a visit] since it would benefit Ukraine and all Churches, but added that the issue of a visit is a complex question. President Kuchma, along with presidents from Germany, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Slovakia and Hungary, met with Pope John Paul II on June 3 during the pope's visit to Poland, yet no invitation for a state visit to Ukraine was extended. The meeting between a delegation from the Holy See and the patriarch of Moscow held in Moscow on December 17-18, 1996, during which issues concerning the Orthodox Church and Greek-Catholic Church in Ukraine, including the topics of expansion and evangelization, were discussed without representatives from either Ukrainian Church present, also exacerbated tensions on all sides. A conflict in the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) in Ukraine over issues of financial impropriety came to a head on November 19, 1996, and Patriarch Dymytrii was dismissed by the UAOC synod of bishops. This resulted in a split in the UAOC, and now four Orthodox Churches operate in Ukraine: two factions of the UAOC, as well as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) headed by Patriarch Filaret, and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), headed by Metropolitan Volodymyr Sabodan. The tension within the UAOC that resulted from the split was further exacerbated when on March 2 Bishop Ioan Boichuk quietly left the UAOC for the UOC-KP. Seminarians from the UOC-KP entered UAOC premises in Kyiv, physically evicted Patriarch Dymytrii and several bishops, occupied the chancery premises and confiscated financial records. Patriarch Dymytrii's dismissal had been predicated on accusations of financial impropriety, but in turn, Patriarch Dymytrii has denied the charges and instead has accused Patriarch Filaret of plotting the entire process in order to take over the UAOC. Tensions between Russian and Ukrainian Churches While tensions increased between the Orthodox Churches in Ukraine, tensions were evident also between the Russian and Ukrainian Churches. In January the leaders of the Ukrainian Republican Party issued a protest to President Kuchma over the quiet transfer to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church- Moscow Patriarchate of artifacts, books and buildings located on the property of the Kyiv-Pecherska Lavra (Monastery of the Caves). On February 20 the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) High Clerical Council, meeting in Moscow, formally excommunicated Mykhailo Denysenko, former ROC metropolitan and now Patriarch Filaret of the UOC-KP. Also excommunicated was the Rev. Gleb Yakunin, a human rights activist and member of the Russian Duma. The Rev. Yakunin believes he was excommunicated for stating that senior Russian Orthodox clergy had collaborated and cooperated with the KGB during the Soviet era. Patriarch Filaret claims he was excommunicated because he is trying to create one unified Ukrainian Orthodox Church outside the jurisdiction of Moscow. In his statement reacting to his excommunication by the ROC, Patriarch Filaret claimed that he was in good company because Hetman Ivan Mazepa also was excommunicated by the Russian Church. A controversy between the Ukrainian and Russian Churches that affected the Orthodox Church in the diaspora as well began on September 24, when Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople responded to an invitation from Patriarch Aleksii of the ROC to meet in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, a meeting that excluded representatives of he UAOC and UOC-KP. The ecumenical patriarch was on a multi-city tour of Black Sea ports to promote ecological awareness in the region. Subsequent press reports stated that the ecumenical patriarch, as a result of the meeting, had called for unity of all Ukrainian Orthodox Churches under Moscow. In his statement the ecumenical patriarch did call upon Patriarch Aleksii to do his utmost for a successful resolution of he issues of Orthodox Church unity in Ukraine. The ecumenical patriarch also restated a historic reality: that the only canonical jurisdiction (authority that is recognized by the other Orthodox Churches as legitimate) of an Orthodox Church on the territory of Ukraine is that of the Moscow Patriarchate. Patriarch Aleksii's press office interpreted these remarks and issued a statement that Patriarch Bartholomew had called upon the patriarch of Moscow to unite all the Orthodox in Ukraine under Moscow's jurisdiction. These statements, as well as the subsequent press reports, caused great consternation among Ukrainian Orthodox faithful worldwide. Strong statements of protest about the meeting itself and about both statements were issued by the UOC-KP and the UAOC. Rather than rely on press reports, Archbishop Antony of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. and Diaspora headed a delegation that traveled to Constantinople on October 7. The ecumenical patriarch met with the delegation and, while he reaffirmed that we recognize the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Moscow as canonical here [in Ukraine], he added, we believe that this is not enough, that this does not solve the concrete problem which exists. Tension between the Ukrainian and Russian Churches turned into conflict when on September 29 buildings that belonged to the UOC-KP were seized in Noginsk, a town on the outskirts of Moscow. In reaction to the seizure of their property, UOC-KP hierarchs faulted a new Russian law signed by President Boris Yeltsin on September 26 that severely limits activities of all religions that have not been registered with Moscow authorities for at least 15 years. For all intents and purposes, the new law curtails the activities of all religious faiths and denominations except for those of the Russian Orthodox Church, and of certain Muslim and Jewish organizations. Close to worshippers and clergy were seized, beaten and arrested in Noginsk, and buildings were occupied by the militia on order of the Moscow regional arbitration court. The Foreign Affairs Ministry of Ukraine issued a formal protest on October 7. Emphasis on unity In November of 1996, in a move to bring unity to the Orthodox Church outside of Ukraine, various Orthodox Churches united under the omophor of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople. On March 2 Bishop Vsevolod (Majdansky), former primate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of America (UOCA), was installed in Chicago by Metropolitan Constantine of the UOC-U.S.A. as archbishop of the Western Eparchy of the UOC-U.S.A. In his remarks after his enthronement, Archbishop Vsevolod spoke of unifying the Ukrainian Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox into one Church, citing Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky and Ukrainian Orthodox saint Petro Mohyla (Petro Mohyla was canonized by the UOC-KP at a special Sobor on December 12, 1996). Hierarchs of the Orthodox Churches in the diaspora stated that the unification of Orthodox Churches outside Ukraine is intended to serve as an example for the Churches in Ukraine. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew made a pastoral visit to Ukrainian Orthodox faithful with a visit to St. Andrew Archdiocesan Center of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. in South Bound Brook, N.J., on October 27. He was greeted by more than 1,200 faithful. He made no references to earlier press reports that alleged he had stated that all Orthodox Churches in Ukraine should unite under Moscow. He did stress reconciliation among all Orthodox faithful in Ukraine. His hosts, hierarchs of the UOC from the U.S. and Canada, stressed that unity in Ukraine must occur, and a canonical Ukrainian Church be recognized. These statements reiterated the position taken by the UOC-U.S.A. hierarchs in a statement released on October 14 that the leadership of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church seeks canonical autocephaly for Orthodoxy in Ukraine, but will not wait idly while the Church in Ukraine refuses to seek unity, and puts the spiritual life of the Church at risk. Others steps towards reconciliation Throughout the year, there were small, often symbolic, steps taken to encourage intra- and inter-confessional harmony. During the first week of January, a group of national deputies of the Verkhovna Rada held a press conference in which they issued a call for Orthodox unity for the sake of Ukraine and her people. On April 16 a decision was made by Patriarch Filaret, Patriarch Dymytrii and the Rev. Serhii Prudko of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC), while meeting in Kyiv, to hold a joint ecumenical service in St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv on Ukraine's Independence Day in August. They issued a statement that one faith is key to a strong Ukrainian nation and that the formation of a pomisna (particular) Orthodox Church would be historically proper. In the Mariyinskyi Palace on July 21, with President Kuchma present, 15 representatives from Ukraine's various confessions signed a memorandum in which they promised to peacefully resolve inter-confessional disputes. The Memorandum of Christian Confessions in Ukraine on the Unacceptability of Using Force in Inter-confessional Relations was signed by representatives of the UOC-MP, the UOC-KP, the UGCC, both factions of the UAOC, the Roman Catholic Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, Seventh Day Adventists, the Evangelical Baptist Church and the Lutheran Church. Members of the Permanent Conference of Ukrainian Orthodox Bishops outside Ukraine held their annual convocation in Genk, Belgium, on July 1-2 during which they decided to dispatch a delegation to the World Forum of Ukrainians to be held in late August in Kyiv. On August 23 President Kuchma received a delegation of Orthodox bishops from the diaspora, which included Archbishop Vsevolod of the UOC-U.S.A., Bishop Yuriy of UOC-Canada, Bishop Jeremiah of UOC- South America, and Anatole Lysyj and Michael Heretz of the U.S. as advisors. The delegation also met with Patriarch Filaret, Patriarch Dymytrii and Bishop Ioann of the UOC-MP. The delegation attended the World Forum of Ukrainians and participated in a roundtable discussion on spiritual unification. During his opening remarks at the World Forum, President Kuchma called for unity among the Orthodox Churches. In reaction to statements made during the World Forum roundtable, Bishop Lubomyr Husar, auxiliary to the archbishop major of the UGCC, said on September 3 in Kyiv that unifying all the various Christian confessions in Ukraine is an impossible task and that the Churches should look for spiritual unification. If we mean one confession, he stated, that will be almost impossible. If we mean one Orthodox tradition, I think that is doable. He added that he hoped celebrations of the year 2000 would be the vehicle by which spiritual union could be achieved. UAOC Metropolitan Petro Petrus of Lviv announced on October 29 that he is joining the UOC-KP, citing as his reason the desire to seek one unifed Church in Ukraine. On October 28, 150 parishes in the Lviv Metropolia of the UAOC joined the UOC-KP for the same reason. In print On January 30 the U.S. State Department issued its annual human rights report in which it praised Ukraine for significant progress towards building a law-based civil society, at the same time focusing on several shortcomings. In the area of religious rights, Ukraine received generally high marks, though incidents of religious discrimination are evident, as well as some government control of non-native religious groups. According to the report, Jews have expanded opportunities to pursue their religious and cultural activities, but anti-Semitic incidents continue to occur and the government is not prosecuting many violations of the law forbidding the sowing of inter-ethnic hatred. In the April edition of the Kyiv-based journal Lyudyna i Svit (Man and the World), an article appeared concerning the religious situation in Ukraine. Among the information cited was that, whereas in Poland 83 percent of those surveyed claim to attend divine liturgy or prayer services at least once a month, only 20 percent in Ukraine, and 7 percent in Russia claim to do so. Nonetheless, 63.4 percent in Ukraine consider themselves to be religious believers, while 29.5 percent consider themselves to be non-believers, and 7.1 percent cannot decide. Of the religious organizations registered in Ukraine, 52 percent are Orthodox, 24 percent are Protestant, 17 percent are Greek-Catholic, 4 percent are Roman Catholic, 1 percent are Muslim and 0.5 percent are Jewish. This differs from the results obtained from individual respondents. Of those who claim any religious identity, 71.8 percent claim to be Orthodox, 17.5 percent to be Greek-Catholic, 5.3 percent to be Muslim, only 2.2 percent to be Protestant, 1.6 percent to be Roman Catholic, 1.2 percent simply believers and 0.4 percent Jewish. The UOC-MP continues to claim the largest number of believers. The American Jewish committee released Anti-Semitism World Report, 1996 on July 22. The report is issued annually, and this year's report listed the Jewish population in Ukraine at 450,000. The report assessed anti-Semitism in Ukraine as a marginal phenomenon, though economic instability and an underdeveloped civic and political culture allow for acts of anti-Semitism to occur with little public reaction. Religious leaders pass away Within days of each other, two renowned religious leaders passed away this fall. Archbishop Volodymyr Sterniuk of the UGCC died on September 29 in Lviv. He was 90. A former Soviet political prisoner who had been imprisoned in the late 1940s and early 1950s following the Soviet liquidation of the UGCC, he served as bishop in the underground of Lviv in 1972. On August 19, 1990, after spending almost his entire life clandestinely ministering to Ukrainian Catholic faithful, he openly celebrated a divine liturgy in St. George Cathedral, the first Ukrainian Catholic liturgy to be celebrated in the cathedral since the takeover by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1946. His funeral was attended by more than 13,000 people on October 2. On October 4 the Rev. Olexa R. Harbuziuk, world leader of Ukrainian Evangelical Baptists, died in Chicago. He was 77. The Rev. Harbuziuk was a devoted religious leader who headed the All-Ukrainian Evangelical Baptist Fellowship for 18 years, and was general secretary of the Ukrainian Evangelical Baptist Convention for 28 years. He was buried on October 10. Other notables * On January 12 Bishop Basil Losten of the Ukrainian Catholic Diocese of Stamford celebrated 25 years of his episcopal ordination and 40 years of his priestly ordination. * On January 14 the Rev. Laurence Daniel Huculak, a 45-year-old member of the Order of St. Basil, was appointed by the Vatican to head the Edmonton Eparchy of the Ukrainian Catholic Church. * On May 11 the cornerstone was blessed for the new Cathedral of the Mother of God in Zarvanytsia in Ternopil Oblast, an event attended by 15,000 people. For several hundreds years, Zarvanytsia has been considered to be a place of religious pilgrimage, and is associated with the protection of the Ukrainian people. * As part of Akcja Wisla commemorations, the (Ukrainian) Basilian complex in Paremyshl, Poland, is undergoing renovation. * The 50th anniversary of the Ukrainian Orthodox League was held in Carneige, Pa., on July 16-20. * The Muslim Party was formed on September 28 in Donetsk. It is headed by Rashit Bragin and founded by 50 delegates from 15 oblasts of Ukraine. Photo (Masses of mourners for Archbishop Sterniuk)",NA,Ukrainian Weekly,1997-12-28,0
"Personal Business Gains Supersede National Interest Under the pretext of privatization and market economy, Russian industrialists and entrepreneurs are illegally acquiring state holdings or are buying formerly state-owned factories and enterprises at a fraction of their cost, thanks to their association with the political elite, thereby accumulating huge financial wealth. Boris Berezovsky, former Russian Security Council Deputy Secretary, who was fired from the government, is one of the best examples of this new breed of entrepreneurs, who accumulated about $3 billion dollars of wealth through questionable business transactions. He has shareholdings or a working capital in the Logovaz Industrial-Financial Group, Obedinenny Bank, Sibneft, Aeroflot, and Avtovaz; most interestingly, he controls newspapers like Nezavisimaya Gazeta and Ogonyok, as well as ORT and TV6 television station. As he became rich and influential, he decided a year ago to take a job in the Kremlin and become the deputy head of President Yeltsin's Security Council, handling the policy on Chechnya. Since Berezovsky holds his personal business interests above the state's national interests, he got into a confrontation with the other six of Russia's biggest financial and media magnates, including Vladimir Gusinsky, the founder of Most Media; Vladimir Potanin, the founder of Oneximbank. Aleksander Smolensky, the founder of Stolichny Savings Bank and Agroprombank; Vagit Alekperov, the president of Lukoil, and Rem Vyakhirev, the president of Gazprom. When the dispute reached its peak, President Yeltin invited all the biggest financial and media magnates to the Kremlin and told these business tycoons you should stop slinging mud at each other through the media. The President indirectly acknowledged that financial interests are controlling the media, politics and, indeed, the country. An outraged Yeltsin declared that the state is above corporate interest. Being aware of shoddy business deals, economic crimes, and corruption, Yeltsin assured his people that he will personally oversee future privatization deals, including the oil company Rosneft, Svyazinvest, three international airports and other important state assets. BUSINESSMEN CONTROLLING POLICY These new Russian industrialists and financiers are now controlling the news media, economy, and politics and, most important of all, they are controlling the national and foreign policy of the Russian Federation. Russia's new cosmopolitan-minded industrialists and entrepreneurs are mostly looking for their business gains and, in the process, they are compromising their country's national interests and security. The defeat and humiliation of Russia in Chechnya, sacrificing the interests of the Armenian people in Nagorno-Karabagh to gain Azeri favors and secure contracts in the Caspian oil deals are some of the consequences of the pursuit of selfish interests on the part of these Russian financiers, who are totally ignoring Russia's strategic and geopolitical interests. Naturally these kinds of scandals, political mischief's, financial irregularities, and economic crimes - the result of keeping personal interests above the state's national interests - are not exclusive to Russia. On the contrary, they are prevalent in almost all the other CIS (NIS) states. It would be fair to say that only the Muslim and Turkic-speaking countries, like Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrghyzstan and Azerbaijan, are more aware of their national interests and security. In fact, they are able to use their natural resources, like oil and gas wealth, as political weapons to assert their economic and political independence from Russia and to promote their national interests. An example is Azerbaijan's effort to secure the political backing of the major countries of the world in its ongoing conflict with the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabagh. The question is, where do the Armenian financiers, industrialists, and entrepreneurs stand in Nagorno-Karabagh's quest for independence? It is no more of a secret that, like their counterparts in Russia and other CIS countries, these nouveaux riches of Armenia are controlling the politics in Armenia; in fact, they are part of the new political elite that are day by day gaining strength over the nationalistic forces. These business people are more interested in their personal financial successes and gains than Armenian national issues. For them, the genocide issue, the territorial issues, and the war of independence in Nagorno-Karabagh are not important; in fact, they are ready to eliminate these issues rather quickly, in order to expand their trade with Turkey and open borders with both Turkey and Azerbaijan. The numerous trips of the late Telman Der Bedrosian, the director of Hraztamash, to Turkey, and the behind-the-scenes moves of Armenian financiers over the past two years to put pressure on the Armenian government to find a quick solution to the Karabagh conflict are ominous signs of their sense of priorities. Similar pressures exerted on Ankara by Turkish Financiers to open the Turkish-Armenian border were rebuffed by the Turkish government in a declaration of their solidarity with Azerbaijan. One cannot be sure if international pressures spearheaded by the oil companies, or internal pressure by the Armenian financiers, industrialists, and entrepreneurs, prompted LDB's October 26, 1997 press conference, followed by his article published in Hayastani Hanrapetutyun [Republic of Armenia] daily on November 1, 1997. POLARIZATION OF REACTION It is obvious that during ANM's recent closed-door meeting in Yerevan, the board of ANM, made up of the political elite, and closed to business circles, reacted positively to LDB's statements. According to ANM's controversial Chairman, Vano Siradeghian, the party's board members were strongly impressed by the president's realism. Unfortunately, Armenia now is polarized between the pro-Karabagh nationalistic forces, standing against capitulation in the Karabagh issue, and the pro-business forces, standing for compromise, to keep Karabagh within Azerbaijan. The characterization of Armenia's political struggles is no longer black and white: It is no longer a struggle between reformers and conservatives, nationalists and pragmatists, based on philosophy, political, strategic and geopolitical views; rather, it is a struggle to keep power and serve financial interests. It would be very patriotic for the leader of Armenia to make a similar statement as the leader of Russia did, when he said that the state is above corporate interests. Press reviews in Armenia reflect the state of confusion, giving a contradictory picture of Armenia's politics. Aravot [Morning] newspaper quotes President LDB, who made a visit to Armenia's Tavoush province, as saying that there is no question of defeatism or selling Nagorno-Karabagh. When you find out what Karabagh will get, what status it will have, and how it will be perpetually linked with Armenia, you will consider the solution to be not a compromise, but a great victory. In Baku, the president of Azerbaijan, Heydear Aliyev, is also claiming victory, but his interpretation of LDB's statement is far different. Hayastani Hanrapetutyun, the official newspaper of the Armenian government, claims, The decision by the US Congress to render direct financial aid to Nagorno - Karabagh amounts to a recognition of Karabagh's de-facto independence and adds Yarevan's flexibility in the talks enables Stepanakert to be resolute and robust, these tactics complement rather than contradict each other. The most idealistic and realistic statement belongs to the newspaper Molorak [Planet]: The political will of the Nagorno-Karabagh leadership will oblige the OSCE and Armenia; decisions concerning the fate of the country are left at the mercy of others. PASHEYEV MAKING HAY We all have to close ranks and carefully analyze how Hafiz Pashayev, the Ambassador of Azerbaijan to the US, took advantage of LDB's blunders. Quoting LDB's statement and article, Pashayev wrote letters to the members of the US House of Representatives on Nov. 12, 1997, stating Rather than following the narrow interests of the Armenian Diaspora, the Armenian lobbyists in the US should pay more attention to the views of President Levon Der Bedrosian, that reflect opinions of Armenians living in Armenia. Then Pashayev continues, President Der Bedrosian stated: `Let us not be preoccupied with self-deception and let us not cherish hollow illusions; on the issue of Karabagh's independence, we have no allies...Our only ally is our rejection of Adventurism.' Utilizing LDB's naivete, Pashayev states further: Frankly, I am sad to see that so many American congressmen blindly follow the lead of such adventurism. This is why, before making public statements, the leaders in Yerevan should think a thousand times, and realize that any blunders they may make will used in the future against Armenians. The OSCE Council of Foreign Ministers' meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark on Dec. 17-18, 1997 will probably not yield any results in the Nagorno-Karabagh peace process. As long as efforts are directed at restoring Azerbaijan's sovereignty over Nagorno-Karabagh, rather than promotion direct negotiations between the leadership of NKR and Azerbaijan, Permanent peace and a just solution to the Karabagh conflict won't be possible. The recent presentation of ABC's Nightline Program with Ted Koppel involving a discussion over Azerbaijan's and the Caspian Sea's (or Lake) oil production and prospective oil pipeline routes, has now brought this issue into our living rooms. Once more, the Azeri and oil lobbyist propaganda were able to manipulate the news media into presenting the Armenians as a source of Azerbaijan's refugee problems while conveniently ignoring the plight of 350,000 Armenian refugees, and labeling the Karabagh struggle as sort of a separatist movement, rather than a freedom struggle against the former Azeri occupiers. We all should pay more attention to the remarks of President of NKR Arkady Gukasyan: Convergence of the positions held by Azerbaijan and Armenia occurred on Baku's terms which alarms us...a phased settlement and subordination to Azerbaijan in accordance with the Lisbon principles...are not based on realities and are pro-Azerbaijan. Now is the time for the government and opposition alike, business circles, financiers, entrepreneurs, intelligentsia, academicians, workers, students, mothers, fathers, brothers, and sisters of Armenia to all unite and support the cause of Armenia, and hold the interests of the Armenian Nation above their personal, financial, political, and party interests, in confirmation of Yeltsin's above-mentioned statement. In the Armenian case, the interests of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabagh should be above the personal and financial interests of any politician, party, organization, association or group. The destiny and future of the Armenian Nation will be decided; it is up to us, to win or to lose.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1997-12-13,0
"St. George Armenian Church of Hartford Celebrates 100 Years Over the weekend of September 27-28, 1997, the parishioners of St. George Armenian Church here began a year of celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Armenian Church of Hartford. The history of the Armenians in Hartford and in Connecticut had its beginnings in the early 1800's, many years before various other eastern seaboard cities and towns. This settlement of Armenians in Connecticut was greatly influenced by the American Protestant missionaries who, traveling to Ottoman Turkey, would bring to America young Armenian men to educate and train as missionaries for them to return to their homeland for the purpose of proselytizing others. The records of the Hartford Seminary, from the years 1834-1927, listed 32 Armenians as alumni of the school. Also, the Congregational Board of Missions, which began in 1810, was based in Farmington, CT, just outside of Hartford. One of the most notable alumni of Hartford Seminary was Mardiros Ananikian. Born in Sebastia in 1875, he was raised by his grandfather after the death of his parents. He became fluent in English, Arabic, Turkish, German, Italian, Hebrew and Greek and was recognized as an expert in Armenian history, Islamic history and customs, Turkish history and culture, Muslim canon la, Hebrew scriptures and New Testament scholarship. He entered Hartford Seminary in 1898, graduated in 1901 and became a professor in the Kennedy School of Missions. He also became the editor of the New York-based Armenian-language paper, Gotchnag. Following World War I, he traveled throughout Turkey and the Middle East and was responsible in bringing to Hartford Seminary a collection of over 1200 manuscripts, twenty of which were Armenian manuscripts, the earliest dating from 1222 C.E. Fr. Tateos Abdalian, Pastor of St. George, in preparation for the anniversary celebration, began researching the origins of the parish and the Hartford Armenian community. Reviewing a 1949 diocesan publication issued on the 50th anniversary of the Diocese, he brought to the attention of the community that, in 1898, the Hartford church officially was organized with the appointment of a Parish Council and began to serve the needs of the community. Further, the Hartford Parish Church was represented at the first Diocesan Assembly in Worcester and the Constitutional Assembly of 1902. The name of their delegate, Mgrditch Khalanjiants, appeared on the ratified document along with all other official delegates. PARISH WITHOUT CHURCH Though not having a church building for many years, the faithful of Hartford would utilize various local churches, including the New Britain Armenian Church, for their needs. It was not until 1953 that the original St. George Armenian Church of Hartford was consecrated. The church was a basement structure that served the need of the community until 1961 when an upper level was added that became the present church facility. In 1985, a two-family home adjacent to the property was purchased for the purpose of providing adequate facilities for the Sunday School. In honor of this most important commemoration, Archbishop Khajag Baramian, Diocesan primate, traveled to Hartford to join with the parishioners in their celebration. Rather than the usual scheduling of meetings with the various parish organizations as so often happens wherever the Primate visits, Fr. Tateos requested that Srpazan make his visit more of a pastoral one by interfacing with various parishioners who were a special representation of the entire community. Arriving on Saturday afternoon, the Primate was first taken to New Britain General Hospital, to the bedside of Fr. Michael Buttero, Pastor Emeritus of Holy Resurrection Church of New Britain. Srpazan Hayr, with Fr. Tateos, offered prayers of healing for Fr. Michael and words of comfort to Yeretzgin Patricia. VISITING THE SICK After leaving the hospital, the Primate was driven to the home of Antranig and Garine Grigoryan. The Grigoryans are among the fifty or so families exiled from Baku, who were re-settled in the Hartford area. They, like the other families from Baku, Karabagh and Armenia, have become active parishioners of St. George. Last February, their three-year-old daughter, Raesa, born with a heart defect, needed to undergo emergency heart transplant surgery in order to save her life. By the grace of God and after months of ups and downs, Raesa has made a total recovery from her ordeal. The Primate was overcome by the joy and thankfulness to God felt by this family and their sense of honor in having the Archbishop come to their home and visit with their daughter. Srpazan gave to Raesa a hand-carved wooden cross from Armenia and offered prayers for her complete and total healing. The next visit was to Yeretzgin Mary Assadourian whose husband, Fr. Khosrov Assadourian, was a most beloved former Pastor of St. George. Yeretzgin Mary has been in poor health of late and unable to come to church regularly. The visit of Srpazan gave both an opportunity to recall their time in Jerusalem, the city where Yeretzgin lived for so many years with her family prior to their coming to the United States. Yeretzgin's radiant glow of joy and love was evident as she expressed her sincere appreciation in not being forgotten on this, the occasion of her church's anniversary. The next visit was to Ms. Suzan Parnakyan, a woman who, fifty-one years earlier, was instrumental in organizing the first Sunday School of St. George and served as the school's first superintendent. Ms. Parnakyan recently had been in a serious auto accident and was recovering from her injuries at home. Again a common chord was struck when both she and the Primate began reminiscing about Bolis, the city where both grew up. GREEK MEMBER OF CHURCH In the evening, the Primate was hosted to dinner by the Parish Council at Avon Old Farms restaurant, one of the premier restaurants in Connecticut. The owner, Mr. Louis Panagakos, and the entire Panagakos family were introduced to Srpazan Hayr. It was revealed to the Primate that Mr. Panagakos began attending St. George with an Armenian friend of his about a year ago and decided to become a dues-paying member of St. George. He stated with pride the reasons for his decision were how the people made him feel so welcome and a part of their family, the warm atmosphere of the parish, and the beautiful and dignified manner in which the Divine Liturgy was celebrated. The Primate welcomed him with joy to the Armenian Church. On Sunday morning, Archbishop Khajag met with the students of the Sunday School prior to the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. Srpazan spoke with the children, blessed them, and gave each a mother-of-pearl cross brought from the Holy Land. The children then led the Primate into the sanctuary of the church as the Badarak began. The Primate's homiletic message of the day addressed the meaning of the Feast of the Discovery of the Holy Cross, directing the faithful to discover the cross in their lives. A gala banquet following church services was enjoyed by the many parishioners and friends who attended. The highlight of the program was a video presentation prepared specifically for the occasion, depicting news articles, photographs and activities of the St. George parish from the past fifty or so years. The success of the entire weekend was due to the Anniversary Committee: Mr. Barbara Zakarian, Chairman, and members Guy and Sally Bedrossian, Menas and Grace Kalagian, Julie Tashjian who worked together diligently and harmoniously in offering to the community a most proper beginning to a year of celebration.

"The Armenian Genocide in European and Israeli Media In recent months, several influential media outlets in Europe and Israel have provided new forums for the discussion of the World War I Armenian Genocide. Professor Vahakn Dadrian's who respective books on the subject continue to trigger renewed interest in the circumstances of the Armenian tragedy. But mainly his title, German Responsibility in the Armenian Genocide, has been the focal point of a number of debates and reviews in a variety of venues, including newspapers, radio, and television broadcasts. On September 22, Deutschland Radio, Germany's nation-wide radio station, in its 7-8 p.m. Political Themes segment, reviewed this book. Despite the delicate character of the main theme of the book - as far as German responsibility is concerned - the reviewer, a specialist in Turkish studies, expresses appreciation for the care with which Prof. Dadrian has documented a very difficult case of complicity in organized mass murder. She affirms Dadrian's main argument that Germany's responsibility had very little to do with that country's inability to intervene, or with cowardice. The reviewer embraces Dadrian's assertion that the deportations did not evolve out of a political or military vacuum. Germany was not only a political and military ally of Turkey but, above all, Germany was the dominant partner in the alliance. The destruction of the Armenian population was the result of conjointly conducted deliberations and conjointly reached decisions. As she declares, The frightful dimension of German complicity involved wide-ranging connivance and, in some cases, active participation. The terms `suggestion' (Anregung) and `consent' (Zusage) describe the modalities of Germany's role. Repeating against Dadrian's principal argument regarding German responsibility, the reviewer declares: The intent of an act can not be separated from the consequences of the act. Even if the Germans only suggested deportations, they are responsible for the consequences, namely, massacres and extermination. In her conclusion, the German specialist describes the book as an expertly (sachkundig) handled book that is based on precise source research (prazise Quellenarbeit), and acclaims the author, Prof. Dadrian, as the pre-eminent authority on the subject of the Armenian Genocide. She ends her extensive review by emphasizing the acute need for translating and publishing it in German. The leading Swiss daily, Neue Zuricher Zeitung, the London Times of Switzerland, in its October 22 weekend edition, in three long columns, published a review of the same book. Under the headline Germany and the Genocide Against the Armenians: The Hitherto Undetermined Responsibility of the Decisionmakers, the reviewer restates and summarizes Dadrian's finding. In three years the three-thousand-year-old presence of the Armenian people in their historic homeland was mostly destroyed. The Turkish authorities still persist in disclaiming responsibility for that genocide and, to date, Germany's role remains unclear. Vahakn Dadrian's latest book is the first systematic attempt to explore this complex problem. The review focuses on the foreknowledge of the German military about the exterminatory aspects of the wartime Armenian deportations. Their participation in decision making regarding the deportations, therefore, implicates them. Equally significant, argues the reviewer, is the fact that a number of high-ranking German military officers participated in the development of ideology and doctrines which paved the way for the liquidation of the Armenians of Ottoman Turkey. The fact that these Germans acted as the representatives of the German State is a reality, maintains the reviewer, that is the main source of Germany's liability. Finally the reviewer underscores a particular aspect of the documentary body of the book. In order to avoid Turkish charges of bias, Dadrian limits his research to data that either originate from Turkish official sources or from similar sources available in the depositories of Austria and Germany, Turkey's principal wartime allies. The review concludes with the assertion that the book in question has a contemporary political relevance, namely, Should Germany, sooner or later, officially acknowledge that indirectly she is co-responsible for the genocide against the Armenians, then Turkey will have new difficulties in continuing to sustain her decades of denial. Germany can hereby teach Turkey a lesson: how to face and cope with the difficult, shameful, and gloomy aspects of a nation's past. Another prominent newspaper, Israeli daily Ha'aretz, The New York Times of Israel, in its November 12 edition, has published a review of Dadrian's German Responsibility in the Armenian Genocide under the heading The Holocaust (Shoa) of the Armenians: Accomplices to the Crime. The four-column review begins with the assertion of the fact that, since the occurrence of the Armenian Genocide, successive Turkish governments have denied it. Germany has benefitted through such denial, since that denial has helped obscure and cover up Germany's role. The review recapitulated chapter by chapter the findings of Prof. Dadrian, emphasizing the fact that Germany was not incapable but rather unwilling to stop the mass murder of the Armenian population. The reviewer then underscores the argument advanced by Dadrian that the limited number of official German protests against the massacres were strictly for the purpose of creating post-war alibis inasmuch as German authorities were anticipating post-war charges of German complicity. Moreover, the Kaiser's government in Berlin did everything it could to suppress the spread of all news regarding the Turkish crime of mass murder. The reviewer also dwells on the barbarities with which tens of thousands of disarmed Armenian labor battalion soldiers were killed off, mostly by slashing their throats or bludgeoning them to death. Finally, the reviewer points out the importance of the book's Appendix C in which Prof. Dadrian thoroughly analyzes the circumstances through which the two other major non-Muslim nationalities, the Greeks and the Jews, escaped a similar fate of mass murder, and he concludes by saying that Dadrian's volume is based on trail-blazing research. Blue Crane Books is proud to record and to convey to the Armenian community these accolades about the value of its publication. It, and the Armenian community in general, are all indebted to Prof. Dadrian who on October 21, 1997 was further acclaimed by Dutch National Television through a one-hour prime-time documentary featuring his work on the subject of the Armenian Genocide.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,1997-12-06,0
"Lessons From History: Let Us Learn To Survive In the aftermath of World War I, with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Middle East, as we know it today, emerged from decisions made by the victorious Allies. The reshaping of the map in this region became a self-assigned function by the Great Powers. The time at the end of the war seemed to be propitious for policy-making when Western European imperialism was in full expansion. Thus, new states were created, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, Transjordan, Palestine (before Israel's emergence), the Arabian Peninsula with its subdivisions, Egypt, Tripolitania and others in North Africa, which were once part of the Ottoman Empire. These were divided between Britain, France and Italy as mandates and protectorates, virtually not much different than colonies. The partition of these mandates between the Great Powers was not achieved smoothly and peacefully without confrontations. Considerations about strategic importance and oil resources played important roles. Ethnic unity and national aspirations of these diverse groups were ignored. The newly created states were artificial mixes of multinational entities. This was a deliberate decision by the imperialist powers to inhibit unity of aspirations and to repress unity of action, if and when a renaissance of nationalistic feelings might occur, and the local people had no say in it. Ethnic diversity would bring about dissimilar aspirations between different nationality groups in their political pursuits. The imperialist powers were counting on the eventuality of discordance between the nationality groups and that would be a deterrent if any one of them should seek independence. They hoped it would necessitate mediation by a broker of sort between the ethnic groups. In such a case, the country in charge of the mandate would have to step in as an arbitrator and would have its own final say in its efforts to perpetuating a dependent status. In their disputes for dominance, former allies became rivals. Great Britain, still the dominant power then, grabbed the creme de la creme of the bounties that were left behind by a collapsed Ottoman Empire. Oil-rich Mesopotamia became a separate state, Iraq, under Britain's mandate. Unquenched as it was, Great Britain attempted to spread her control also farther east, over the oil resources of Baku (capital city of present Azerbaijan) as well. British influence in this region was also considered by the Foreign Office then to have strategic importance as a protective barrier on the way to India against Czarist Russia. Pursuing that course, Great Britain curried the favor of the Tatar people (known then under that appellation), as in number they were the majority of the population and were more discontent under Czarist rule than the Armenians who were, for the most part, middle class. However, with the Bolshevik Revolution, which spread over the countries of the caucasus too, all natural resources became state property and Great Britain was pushed out of the scene. HISTORY REPEATS ITSELF WITH SOME SHIFTS IN THE SCENERY It is often said that history repeats itself. However, not necessarily always so. We can alter that course when our future is at stake. For obvious reasons, we, Armenians, should not let some of the tragic episodes from our past history under oppressive Turkish and Azeri rule be repeated. No more periodic massacres, like those in Turkey during the years of 1894, 1896, 1909, and the deportations and the genocide of 1915 to 1923. No more massacres, like the most recent ones in Sumgait, Baku and Genja, in Azerbaijan. These are the lessons of history that we should never forget. These are the lessons of history that should teach us that, once Karabagh is gone, Armenia will be next. Notwithstanding the hardships of the blockade that Armenians are enduring now, they are already hardened. So much so that today they have succeeded in being on the high ground, as they never have been before. They defeated Azerbaijan on the battlefield. They would be really stupid if they give up their high-ground positions and let defeated Azerbaijan dictate conditions for the settlement of a peace accord to them. Promises, promises, promises for protection. History has taught us that these are all hogwash. Whom should Armenians trust? Great Britain, the Perfidious Albion? Whom should they trust now? Frivolous France, who abandoned them in Cilicia? Whom should they trust again, America? How about the Wilsonian fiasco? In 1857, a book was published on this subject under the title of The Struggle for Oil, and subtitled Distribution of Oil Resources and the Rivalries between the British and American Oil Interests for Hegemony in the Middle East. It was a doctoral dissertation that was published in Armenian under the sponsorship of The Academy of Sciences of Soviet Armenia. Reviewed appreciatively in the All-Union Academy of Sciences Magazine Sovietkaya Vostokavedenia (Soviet Oriental Studies) in Moscow, this book was later translated into Arabic in Beirut, Lebanon under the title of OIL AND BLOOD.(1) This book gives a description of the overall struggle of the largest oil monopolies in their pursuit to control world oil resources and international oil markets, from the earlier years when oil became an increasingly important source of energy and raw material in a fast-growing chemical industry. This book, written in the early 1950's, described in particular the events related to the rivalries between the oil monopolies in their pursuit for access to the then newly discovered enormous oil resources in the Arabian Peninsula. Its focus is mainly on the events succeeding World War II. Great Britain and the US, each supporting their respective oil interests. However, with the Soviet Union emerging from the war as a new world power, and notwithstanding British and American rivalry over world oil resources, a series of ententes was established between these two major capitalist powers in the political front as a counteraction inhibiting the eventuality of the spread of communist ideology. This was expressed in the form of pacts, such as NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization), its Asian variant SEATO (South East Asia Treaty Organization), and METO (Middle East Treaty Organization, or the Baghdad Pact), and others. However, in spite of these political agreements, which were directed against the Soviet Union, the rivalry between the US and Great Britain continued to deepen over world oil riches for sometime longer, until a modus vivendi was established by way of partition acceptable to the parties. In the meantime, leadership passed rapidly at the hands of the American oil monopolies with the active support of the US government. EVENTS AFTER THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET UNION After the collapse of the Soviet Union under the weight of over seven decades of autocratic rule, the fifteen former republics gained their independence. As a result, Russia lost its control and influence over the former component nations of the Union. The doors became wide open, creating opportunities for the Western powers to penetrate into the areas of erstwhile Soviet patrimony. The doors were open as well for Turkey to achieve her dream of Pan-Turkism. As we read this book relating about rivalries of the past, we, once again, realize that today's ominous game, in almost all aspects, is a repetition of the past. This time, however, the scenery has changed, with the focus shifting toward the Caspian Sea littoral and the leadership passing into the hands of America. In this dreadful game, the Armenians are the victims, once again. To gain the favor of newly independent oil - and gas-rich Muslim nations of the former Soviet Union, Christian Karabagh's right of self-determination is being contested. In the aftermath of World War I, when attempts were made to hoard those resources by the then leading actors, the British oil monopolies had the total support of their government. Britain was then the world leader with a widespread empire while the US was a junior partner. Today, the reverse has happened; the US has became the incontestable world leader, while Britain has been reduced to the rank of junior partner. In this new game, to win concessions of Azerbaijani oil resources, US diplomats are assiduously trying to gain Azeri favor. In these efforts they are even repudiating all legal and moral principles that our administration so devotedly advocated to be their headstrong protector. The American people are proud of their high moral traditions and for their record of strict adherence to the principles of international law. However, by ignoring his own pledge of neutrality, President Clinton, under pressure from the international oil monopolies, is breaking his promises. A most recent example o his transgression is the adoption of a version favorable to the Azeris at the Lisbon Conference for the settlement of the Karabagh conflict. Going a step farther, the State Department put pressure on the rest of the members at the Conference to take sides by supporting Azerbaijan. Along with her Western allies, America cannot simply take side of the Azeris and expect to preserve the peace in this part of the world. With this arbitrary action, America is trying to coerce the Armenians of Karabagh into giving up favor of the Azeris' claim of territorial integrity. By such an action, it will hardly be possible for a settlement of the conflict to materialize. For an honest and fair solution to the Karabagh dispute, there are a number of fundamental considerations that should be taken into account. These are: 1) Karabagh (Artsakh in Armenian) was, and is, according to all objective sources, ethnically and historically part of Armenia. First of all, Nagorno-Karabagh is a misnomer. Nagorno in Russian means mountainous, while Karabagh is a combination of the Turkish word kara meaning black, and begh which means garden in Persian. It is the reflection of the years of occupation by alien invaders during the long course of tragic Armenian history. Yet, in spite of that, all of the time and without interruption, Karabagh maintained its Armenian character. With an eye toward objectivity, I will be quoting from well-documented non-Armenian sources. In a Report (2), jointly authored by Lady Caroline Cox and John Eibner, under the title of Ethnic Cleansing in Progress: War in Nagorno-Karabagh, we read: Ancient Greek and Roman sources indicate that Nagorno-Karabagh constituted a part of larger Armenian political entities from at least the second century BC, until the partition of the kingdom of Armenia by the Romans and Sassanid Persians at the beginning of the 5th century AD. Thereafter, Nagomo Karabagh... ...fell under the rules of... other invaders, the last of them by Persia ...before being conquered by the Russian Empire in 1808. After the czarist takeover of the whole region of the Caucasus, the people living in what we presently call Azerbaijan did not have a standard name, and were generally placed together with all the other Turkic and Muslim people of the Russian Empire under the appellation of Tatars. Azerbaijan, as a nation, did not exist, while Artsakh (Karabagh) existed millennia earlier. The famous British world traveler, geographer, historian H.F.B. Lynch took two separate journeys through Armenia late in the 19th century. In his book, Armenia: Travels and Studies, he describes a sojourn in Karabagh (Artsakh) and states: It is a country forming a miniature Armenia on the side of the Caspian. According to his description Karabagh was territorially much larger than what Armenians claim today. On the other hand, the distorters of history fall into ridicule by even maintaining the view that Armenia never existed. Quoting from East Uras, a prominent Turkish historian in his book, The Armenians in History and the Armenian Question, we read on page 219: Armenia cannot be regarded as anything more than a simple geographical entity having no definite political frontiers and it is quite impossible that, as an organized and continuous Armenian state, recognized by other nations, with national outlook, it could ever have existed in that part of Anatolia. This is a book that has a number of prefaces written by other prominent Turkish historians. This is also a book full of contradictions. For example, Ertugual Zekai Okte writes: ...there exist twenty-six thousand books in the libraries of the world on Armenia and the Armenians...it is noteworthy that with few exceptions they are all based on a feeling of hatred and hostility towards Turkey and the Turks. (see page 1 of the same book). By admitting the existence of so many books, Okte contradicts Esat Uras's assertion that Armenia never existed as a nation. Contradicting himself, once again Esat Uras writes in a chapter under the title of The Geography of Armenia writes: Historical Armenia covered an area of approximately 250,000 square kilometers, extending for more than 1,000 kilometers from east to west and 500 kilometers from north to south. Greater and Lesser Armenia together occupied an area almost as wide as France (see page 239) Further down, Esat Uras describes the borders; he lists the names of the rivers, mountains, lakes, and, most importantly for us, the names of the administrative divisions, on whose list Artsakh is tenth in line. (see pages 240 and 241) Now that, even according to Turkish sources, we have established Artsakh as being one of the provinces, hence an integral part of Armenia, this is one important criterion in favor of the right of self-determination over territorial integrity that would perpetuate alien oppressive rule. America, with its Western allies acting under the banner of the OSCE, has to come to terms with the idea that Karabagh is part of Armenia. Any peace arrangement that does not redress the wrongs of the past is perpetuating Stalin's legacy. Any promises that security will be provided under Azeri rule will never be taken seriously. America and the West simply cannot side with the Azeris and hope that peace will be preserved in this part of the world. With no peace, there will be no oil for the oil barons. Furthermore, disaster might follow, and no party will be safe. 2) What were the circumstances under which Karabagh was placed under Azerbaijani suzerainty? After the Sovietization of the Caucasus, both Armenian SSR and Azerbaijan SSR placed claims on Nagorno - Karabagh. However, based on the nationality rights principle, it was first assigned to Armenia. But on July 5, 1921, this decision was reversed upon orders of Stalin, and Nagorno-Karabagh was awarded to Azerbaijan. Apparently Stalin's reason was to keep an ethnic mix, under his perfidious policy of divide and conquer. In turn, America, with its Western allies, in counting on Armenian credulity, is following the same example by pressuring the Armenians of Karabagh to continue living under the oppressive Azerbaijani rule with all the risks involved. One of the most recent examples was the massacres of the Armenians in Sumgait, which was a repetition of the same tragedy of the past. Pressuring the Armenians of Karabagh to turn back to the old status imposed during the grievous days of Soviet rule is nothing less than perpetuating Stalin's legacy. Ethnic lineage, the ancestral heritage of the Karabagh population since time immemorial, is evidence that the population of this land was Armenian. This should be the incontestable criterion in decision making involving a choice between the rights of self-determination and territorial integrity. 3) Since the two rights, as established in the United Nations Organization's Charter, namely the right of self-determination and the right of territorial integrity, cannot be applicable at the same time, the question is: which one should have priority over the other? Benjamin Wiener, a former diplomat and President of Probe International, in an article that appeared in a February 1993 issue of The Wall Street Journal under the title The Crime of Selective Morality. writes: We practice selective morality. It is a curious process by which we focus on certain suffering around the world but we ignore others equally inhumane. This inconsonant procedure is very much at play today, in our absorption with Bosnia and Somalia on the one hand and our indifference about Sudan on the other. He means Christian Sudan under the oppressive rule of northern Sudan's Islamic rule. In fact, fundamentalism is spreading over most of the Islamic countries. It behooves to seriously consider the effects of this trend before it is too late. Evidently it is because of his lack of information on the events in Christian Karabagh who are fighting for their survival, that Benjamin Wiener fails to mention these events. The officials of our State Department justify this course of action as supporting American interests. This kind of reasoning raises many doubts in our minds, and disgust in our feelings. Does the denial of human rights mean supporting American interests? Or, again, does the denial of the right of self-determination mean supporting American interests? PURPOSE AND PRINCIPLES OF THE UNITED NATIONS ORGANIZATION In the UN Charter there are two important articles, which apparently are contradictory to each other in some cases. Under Article 1, paragraph 2, we read: To develop friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace. In the same Charter, under Article 2, paragraph 4, we read: All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations. Having this in view, the question is: which one supersedes the other in this particular case? A decision cannot be based by applying these two Articles at the same time. The right of territorial integrity implies perpetuation of Azerbaijani rule over Karabagh. In the aftermath of World War II, all colonies were liberated. On the eve of the 21st century Armenians of Karabagh are being coerced to live under a colonial status. The right of self-determination, in this case, is liberation from the Azerbaijani yoke. Ecstatic in its leadership role, the Administration has become accustomed to applying a double standard in terms of the rules established by the UN Charter, while refusing to understand the meaning of definition. 4) The degree of importance for the rival parties in this conflict for the acquisition of Karabagh. If Karabagh goes, Armenia will be next. Andrei Sakharov (1921-1989), famous Russian nuclear physicist and father of the Russian hydrogen bomb, who later on became a prominent human rights activist and Nobel Prize winner, was an objective observer of the Karabagh conflict. On the eve of his unexpected death in November 1989, he declared: For Azerbaijan, the issue is a matter of ambition, for the Armenians of Karabagh it is a matter of life and death. 5) Whenever and wherever volition exists, solution also exists. a) Peace Corridor: Inasmuch as Nagorno - Karabagh is already de facto independent, its de jure recognition, and it is a small price to pay. Against that, Azerbaijan, with a much larger territory, will gain. Desperately in need of capital, it will not only be able to exploit its oil resources abundantly, but also secure a safe and most efficient passage for a system of pipelines through Karabagh and Armenia, thence over Turkey to a Mediterranean port, to world markets. This will also be a gratifying arrangement for the international oil concessionaires that have already poured billions of dollars with enormous expectations that are under the risk of failure, if war should follow and disaster ensue. This would also mean the signing of a long-term treaty ensuring free passage of a system of surface connections - rail and auto, in most the same manner as the already existing international treaties for free passage of peaceful traffic in the straits of the Bosphorus and through the Suez Canal. b) Population Exchange: History teaches us that countries with mixed ethnicity will always have problems. To resolve that, in the aftermath of World War I, notwithstanding their hostilities, an agreement was reached for a population exchange between Greek villages and Turkish villagers living within each other's peripheral boundaries. This secured a more monolithic population in their respective countries. There are other precedents for the same kind of solution. The same agreement can be reached between the Armenians and the Azerbaijanis. With the present situation as it is, Armenians out of Baku, Sumgait, and Ganja, and Azeris out of Nagorno-Karabagh, both populations could permanently settle in their respective countries and appropriate each other's properties left behind. This would ease the problem. These are the elements to be contemplated by all parties, among whom Karabagh should incontestably be included in the final decision-making process. And if America and the OSCE Minsk group members want to be part of the negotiations for an equitable and honest solution, they are welcome. If, however, their decision is conditional on Azeri oil concessions, they should desist from meddling in other nations' affairs. This is problem uniquely between Karabagh and Azerbaijan. And in that process the Armenian side should not forget the lessons of history that suggest: If Karabagh is gone, Armenia will be next.","Touryantz, Hagop J",Armenian Reporter International,1997-11-15,0
"Patriarch Bartholomew visits Ukrainian Orthodox Center SOUTH BOUND BROOK, N.J.-Flying in from New York, three helicopters carrying Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Con-stantinople and his delegation descended at dusk on October 27 to land on the grassy mall of the St. Andrew Archdiocesean Center of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. Against the backdrop of a fading sun, more than 1,200 Orthodox faithful, most from the Ukrainian and Greek Churches, greeted the Patriarch, who had arrived in the United States on October 19 to begin a monthlong pastoral visit to Orthodox communities throughout 16 cities in the U.S., as well as to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Greek Archdiocese of America. Patriarch Bartholomew, 57, was enthroned in Istanbul (as Constantinople has been known since 1930) on November 2, 1991, and is considered to be the first among equals of the eight Orthodox patriarchs in the world and the spiritual leader of close to 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide who are divided among 15 Churches. It is his first visit to the United States, which is home to more than 5 million Orthodox Christians, and his first pastoral visit with the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. and Diaspora since that Church accepted the omophor (spiritual authority) of the ecumenical patriarch in 1995. The Ukrainian Orthodox Archdiocesean Center in New Jersey is a large complex, and during his five-hour visit the patriarch toured the seminary, the consistory, the cemetery, the museum and library, as well as the historic Henrick Fisher House, built in 1688, home of New Jersey's delegate to the Continental Congress located on the property. Under the night sky, a moleben (memorial service) was held outdoors on the steps of St. Andrew Memorial Church, and later in there evening, a banquet, attended by more than 500 guests representing Ukrainian, Greek and several other Orthodox Churches, was held in the patriarch's honor at the Ukrainian Cultural Center. Patriarch Bartholomew's tenure has coincided with the break-up of the Soviet Union and its sphere of influence in Eastern Europe, a region of the world where Orthodoxy dominated as a religion before the onset of communism. He actively promotes pan-Orthodox unity and the revival of Orthodoxy in its traditional homelands. A Turkish citizen of Greek descent, Patriarch Bartholomew, speaks half a dozen languages fluently, including English, and has traveled extensively in the past several years with his message that Christian Orthodoxy is not a religion of the past, but a vibrant faith of the future. He predicts that millions will return, or convert, to Orthodoxy in the next century, especially in the former Communist countries that are only now becoming more fully aware of the moral and spiritual void in their lives. In his blessing at the end of his pastoral visit at the Archdiocesean Center, he said, We do not see our faith only an ancient, but as a living faith to guide us everyday and everywhere ...we see the next millennium not in terms of aging, but being young again ...we are entering the springtime of a new millennium. Relying on his moral authority as first among equals to encourage better relations among the Orthodox Churches, the patriarch has also approached Catholic, Jewish and Muslim leaders. Patriarch Bartholomew and Pope John Paul II met in 1995 for three days, and relations between the Vatican and Constantinople are said to be good. In an address several days ago at the Jesuit-run Georgetown University in the Washington, Patriarch Bartholomew stated, Our heart is opposed to the specter of everlasting separation ...our heart requires that we seek again our common foundations. He has traveled to Israel, and during a visit to the United States Holocaust Museum in Washington last week, referred to the victims of the Holocaust as martyrs who should be remembered for all eternity. The patriarch is also actively seeking to improve relations with Muslim leaders, since many Orthodox Christians now live in Muslim-dominated countries. Though the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S. and Diaspora has united with the Mother Church of Constantinople, Orthodox in Ukraine divide their allegiance between the Moscow Patriarchate, the Kyiv Patriarchate or those that are autocephalous. Throughout the patriarch's pastoral visit, there was no direct mention of, or indirect allusion to, press reports released last month in Ukrainian and Russian media which stated that after a meeting in Odesa with patriarch Aleksei of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Bartholomew allegedly said that the various Orthodox Churches in Ukraine must unite under the Moscow Patriarchate, the Church that many Ukrainian Orthodox view as the chief oppressor of their faith. Printed materials provided to the press in South Bound Brook offered excerpts from the ecumenical Patriarch's statement with regard to that meeting, which included a call for ecclesiastical unity among the Orthodox Ukrainian people, but no statement that such unity must be under the aegis of the Moscow patriarch. Though the ecumenical patriarch recognizes the canonical jurisdiction of the patriarch of Moscow in Ukraine, he adds in the statement: but we believe that this is not enough, that this does not solve the concrete problem which exists. In his homily during the religious service, Patriarch Bartholomew urged patience and stated: We recognize the sorrowful situation which has been created in your motherland. We feel deeply the pain of the local Orthodox Church as our own pain, for as your Mother Church we know when one member suffers, all members suffer with him. ...We will work all the more to find means of reconciliation and agreement. This requires great patience ...the heart must mature so that we may be guided to the correct solution for all. Whereas Patriarch Bartholomew stressed unity and reconciliation among the Churches in Ukraine, Ukrainian Orthodox hierarchs and laity, while desiring unity, expressed their fervent desire for autocephaly as well. In his address during the moleben, Metropolitan Constantine appealed to the patriarch: Like Estonia, small in number but mighty in faith, also prays and works for the day when it will receive the blessing of the Mother Church of Constantinople to take her rightful place in the Orthodox world. ...We are confident that the see of St. Andrew will be that pastoral agent which will heal the wounds and pave the way for the Church in Ukraine - an independent nation - to be restored to its rightful place Helen Greenleaf, president of the Senior Ukrainian Orthodox League, in her banquet greeting to the patriarch stated, the motto of our organization is `dedicated to our church and devoted to its youth,' and it is with devotion and dedication that we are praying for a united Orthodox Church in Ukraine and for its autocephaly to be recognized by world Orthodoxy. Mrs. Greenleaf received a standing ovation from many of the Ukrainian Orthodox guests. During his homily and blessing, patriarch Bartholomew several times addressed his Ukrainian faithful in Ukrainian, and frequently acknowledged the suffering of the Ukrainian people. He praised the deep faith that has sustained Ukraine for generations and alluded to the ancient bond between Kyiv and Constantinople, between the people of Ukraine and the ecumenical patriarch. Seated at the head table with the patriarch were hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church from the U.S. Canada and South America, as well as hierarchs of the Greek Orthodox Church worldwide, and of the Carpatho-Rusyn Orthodox Church in the U.S. Metropolitan Stephen Sulyk, as well as Bishop Basil Losten and Bishop Robert Moskal of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, Roman Catholic Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark and several other Roman Catholic bishops also were seated with the patriarch. Viktor Bondarenko, chairman of Ukraine's State Committee on Religious Matters, delivered a greeting on behalf of the government of Ukraine and appealed for the patriarch's help to unify all the Orthodox Churches in Ukraine into one pomisna (particular) Church. At the end of the banquet, Emil Skocypeck, treasurer of the consistory and property manager for the centers received a special recognition from the patriarch for his exceptional effort in preparing the center for the personal visit. After the visit. Ukrainian Orthodox hierarchs stated that they were grateful for the patriarch's visit, his message and his recognition of the struggle of Ukraine's people. Patriarch Bartholomew has traveled to Washington, New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.

"Archbishop Barsamian Visits Middle East Christian Communities as Part of a Delegation from the National Council of Churches (NCC) Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, in his role as Vice President of the National Council of Churches of Christ in America (NCC), was a leader, along with Rev. Dr. Joan Campbell, General Secretary of the NCC representatives who traveled to the Middle East for two weeks. The ten-member delegation visited Christian communities, and religious and political leaders in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel and Palestine. The NCC is an ecumenical organization comprised of 33 Orthodox and Protestant churches throughout the United States with over 52 million faithful. One of their major roles is to create ecumenical relations, to engage ecumenical relations, to engage in co-operative activities, and to speak to issues concerning human rights. The organization also lobbies the US government on policy which affects the life and welfare of US citizens and, on a broader level, those concerns of human rights and religious freedom throughout the world. The Diocese Armenian Church has been a vital member of the NCC for many years. TEN YEARS SINCE LAST VISIT According to David Weaver, Director of the NCC's Middle East Office, and a member of the delegation, the purpose of the visit to the Middle East was to renew ecumenical ties, affirm past partnerships and look to a future of relationships. Archbishop Barsamian noted that it had been ten years since an official delegation from the NCC has visited the region, and the visit was in response to an invitation from the Middle East Council of Churches (MECC). It was a wonderful experience to witness our faith as Christians to our sisters and brothers in the Middle East, as there are so many thousands of Christians in the region. The visit provided a good opportunity to show our support and to reestablish and reaffirm our solidarity with them, said the Archbishop upon his return. The delegation included: The Rev. Dr. Joan Campbell, NCC General Secretary; Archbishop Barsamian, NCC Vice President; Dr. Sylvia Faulk, NCC Vice President at Large; Mr. Mervin Kenney, NCC Director for Global Missions Partnerships; The Rev. Randolph L. Naylor, NCC Associate General Secretary for Communication; The Rev. Albert M. Pennybacker, NCC Associate General Secretary for Public Policy; The Rev. Dr. Gordon L. Sommers, NCC Immediate Past President; The Rev. Margaret Orr Thomas, Coordinator for Interfaith Relations, Worldwide Ministries Division, Presbyterian Church; and Mr. David Weaver, NCC Director, Middle East Office. The group began their pilgrimage in Damascus, Syria. It was especially fitting that this city was the first stop as it was on the road to Damascus that Saul had his great Conversion Damascus has been at the center of Christian life for centuries and was also the place from which St. Paul began his ministry. Even today, the Christian community is strong and active. SYRIA FIRST STOP, THEN LEBANON The delegation was met at the airport by the General Secretary of the MECC, Rev. Dr. Rhiat Jarjor, and the Primate of the Armenian Apostolic Church of Damascus, Archbishop Knel Djerian. Archbishop Djerian was accompanied by Armenian community members to greet Archbishop Barsamian and the delegation. While in Damascus the group had the opportunity to meet with leaders of the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches. The U.S. Ambassador to Syria extended an invitation to the delegation to visit the U.S. Embassy where they met with the Ambassador and his colleagues and also attended a reception in the honor of the delegation. The Vice President of Syria, Mr. Abdel Halim Khaddam, welcomed the group on behalf of the Syrian government and spent over an hour with them discussing the situation in the Middle East as well as the peace process. From Syria the group traveled to Lebanon where they again met with both religious and secular leaders. As one of the major cultural centers for Armenians, despite the dwindling numbers of Armenians and Christians in the area, as well as the political circumstances, it is still a vital and energized community. The delegation participated in the celebration of Divine Liturgy at the Armenian Church in Bikfaya, followed by a luncheon with His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia. In the same afternoon the delegation traveled to the mountains where they met with the Patriarch of the Maronite Church His Beatitude Patriarch Mar Nasrallah Butros Sfeir at his summer residence. In Lebanon, where there is an active Christian presence, the delegation met with leaders of the Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches as well as members of the Executive Committee of the MECC of Lebanon. Besides its meetings with Christian leaders, the NCC delegation also held meetings with Muslim religious leaders as well as the intellectual leaders of both the Christian and Muslim communities. The President of the Lebanese Republic, Mr. Elias Hraoui, spent an hour with the delegation in the Presidential Palace. The group with the Prime Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, as well as the Speaker of the Parliament, Mr. Nabih Birri. Following their stay in Lebanon, the delegation traveled to Jordan where they met with various representatives of the local Christian communities, including a group of Armenians. They also met with the Prime Minister Dr. Abdel Salam Al Majali who presented an analytical assessment of the situation in the Middle East and was kind enough to respond to questions from the delegation. In Syria, Lebanon and Jordan the delegation received much press coverage from the local media. Stories regarding the visit were broadcast on television and radio, as well as in all of the local papers. Any trip to the Christian communities of the Middle East is not complete without a visit to the Holy City of Jerusalem. This city has been at the forefront of Christianity since the first century. It was Jerusalem where Christ taught, where Christ walked, where Christ was crucified and from where he was resurrected. As Etchmiadzin is the head of the Armenian Church, so Jerusalem is Christianity's heart. A Holy City where every street breathes the life, spirit and teachings of our Lord and the stories of the first Christians. This leg of journey was particularly poignant for the delegation. HOLY LAND SEGMENT PARTICULARLY POIGNANT In the Holy Land, the delegation had the opportunity to meet with the Patriarchs of the Greek, Latin and Armenian Churches as well as other Christian leaders of Jerusalem. His Beatitude Patriarch Michel Sabba, President of the MECC, hosted a dinner at the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem in honor of the delegation's visit. The group also enjoyed a delicious Armenian luncheon at the Armenians Patriarchate of Jerusalem, hosted by His Beatitude archbishop Torkom Manoogian, Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem. This luncheon was also a reunion for the delegation and the Patriarch as His Beatitude was an active members of the NCC during his tenure as the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America. Members of the delegation had the opportunity to meet with the intellectual leaders of the Jewish community and also had meetings at the Foreign Ministry, the Ministry of Religious Affairs of Israel, as well as the Prime Minister's Office. The group traveled to Gaza in the West Bank to meet with President of the Palestine National Authority, Mr. Yasser Arafat, who warmly welcomed the members of the delegation and expressed his appreciation to them for their concern and concerted efforts to assist the peace process in the region. Following the visit to Jerusalem, some members of the delegation visited Cyprus and the Headquarters of the MECC. With each visitation, the delegation presented a lovely commemorative crystal sculpture to their host that quoted Ephesians 4:3 ...making every effort to maintain the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. THREE COMMON CONCERNS As the delegation had the distinct opportunity to meet with important religious and secular leaders during their visit, they look away many impressions. Upon their return to the United States, the NCC issued a public statement detailing their pilgrimage as well as conclusions from it. Though variously expressed and with varying degrees of urgency, the leaders and people of the church in each place expressed three common concerns. The churches are concerned for the transmission of their Christian faith to their children and for the provision of a secure future for them; for the continued migration of Christians from the region to North America, Europe and other countries; and for the apparent breakdown, and even reversal, of the peace process between Israel and the Arab states and the Palestinians, despite their previous commitments and a nearly universally accepted international consensus. Archbishop Barsamian noted upon his return to New York, As Christianity began in the East it is only fitting that this delegation revisit their Christian roots and the ancient Patriarchates and Christian communities that have held from throughout the centuries. As Christians are minorities in all of the countries of our visit, it is vital that we in the West make it known that we fully support the mission of our brothers and sisters in Christ and that we are willing to work with them to ensure the security of the Christian churches in the region. The Primate also stated, As we approach the 2000th anniversary of the nativity of Jesus Christ in Bethlehem, we pray that our brothers and sisters will have the opportunity to celebrate this joyous event in peace and solidarity with all Christian peoples.

"Petition For Peace and Human Rights in the Caucasus The following petition was sent recently to US President Bill Clinton Along with President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Jacques Chirac of France, you have taken the responsibility for establishing peace on the question of Karabagh in the Caucasus. [The question is] Whether the peace will come about by peaceful neighborly negotiations between Karabagh and Azerbaijan (as Armenia and Karabagh have achieved with victory by a war, as Azerbaijan in the war since 1985) or settled by a war, as Azerbaijan desires, with the help of Turkey and American oil interests. You have made a human rights concept effective in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia in Yugoslavia using the NATO forces to establish the boundary. Now the arrest and trial of criminal officials has started. In your concern for human rights you also supplied clothing and energy to Armenia which was blockaded by Azerbaijan, Turkey and American oil interests. We reelected you in 1996 to provide sanity and honesty in our foreign policy. The problem in Karabagh started with President Wilson when he transferred the control of Kars, Nakhicheven and Karabagh to Armenia in May 1919. At that time Admiral Bristol applied censorship with the support of missionary leaders on all Americans to prevent the news of way and genocide reaching the Congress, the President and the Americans at home. This capped a century (1829-1928) of secret operations by the State Department which failed to gain control of the resources of the Ottoman Empire. In 1997, as President of the United States, you cannot avoid the moral decision before you. Because Turkish diplomacy made Turkey victorious over the Allies, Armenia, and the USA, all the assets of America were abandoned in Turkey along with the Christians. This gridlock of isolationism by the Wilson/Harding administration made Turkey a 100% Muslim country. But its brutality is now felt today against fellow Muslim Kurds. Until we acknowledge the century of State Department secret operations, we shall not achieve the bridge into the twenty-first century you promised us in the 1996 campaign, using Theodore Roosevelt as a background. As a survivor-author who has firsthand knowledge about the best and the worst of America both here and abroad, I, Charles N. Mahjoubian, am requesting this change in America's foreign policy. Therefore, we the undersigned petition you to reestablish the human rights of the Armenians of Karabagh by self-determination and establishment of a government which they have already achieved since 1992 by victory over Azerbaijan.

"Phila. K of V Honors Dr. Charles Mahjoubian as Man of the Year Charles N. Mahjoubian, DDS, of the Philadelphia Ardashad Lodge was named its 1996 Man of the Year. Over the years Dr. Mahjoubian has been a practicing dentist, a scholar, a writer of timely articles in numerous Armenian and American publications, a lecturer, and an author of a number of in-depth books on Armenian history and the genocide. To this day, Dr. Mahjoubian, a very young 90 year old, continues writing, lecturing and influencing he Armenian and American communities on the wrongs that took place during the early part of this century. He has quite uniquely studied America's involvement and documented why American abandoned the Armenians, became accessories to the genocide in 191 and in 1919 became accomplices in the second phase of the genocide. Much of this was due to missionary leaders in Turkey influencing Admiral Mark L. Bristol to apply censorship on all Americans in Turkey as a means of preventing news of the genocide from reaching America and the American people. Dr. Mahjoubian has written a number of books, including Dear President Bill (pending) - Communications with the President since 1991; Garbis to America - Survivor Charles (Garbis) Mahjoubian safe from World War I and the Armenian Genocide (1914-1922), reports the full impact of the genocide along with America's role, citing events in Zeytoon, Evereg, Harput, Diarbekir, the Armenians on he Russian Front and the Dardanelles, and the British/French attack on the Dardanelles; Supreme tragedy of All History - Historical review of the Armenians and two centuries of American-Armenian relations; America's Conscience: Gorbachev's Dilemma - Two centuries of American moral/ diplomatic/political crimes involving Armenia and the genocide; Armenians, Armenia, Diaspora (pending); Scoundrels and Bashi-Bazooks - Dates and events from 301 to World War I/A Armenian Genocide. Introductory background of physical and moral crimes by governments against the wishes of their people; Historical Shorts: Warriors Against Brutality and for Human Rights - Theodore Roosevelt and Antranik Ozanian. Dr. Mahjaubian is currently writing a series of articles in Hai Gyank or Armenian Life. Dr. Mahjoubian started his years of research in 1923 and hasn't stopped researching, writing and lecturing since. He not only researched and wrote about the period but also lived it firsthand. He knew and lived among the missionaries, Turkish people and other Muslims in that part of the world. His writings are of great importance to everyone, Armenians and Americans alike, and especially the young who need to understand the past in order to protect the future from any reoccurrence of this kind of horror. Dr. Mahjoubian was born on October 11, 1997 to Nerses and Agavni Mahjoubian in Konya, a holy city of Turkish Islam. His family was saved by faithful Muslim officials and neighbors during the genocide. In June of 1919 he was separated from his family and lived through the Greek - Turkish war and the Konyali Turks' rebellion against Kemal pasha's forces - 1920-1922. He was expelled from Konya in November 1922 and was a refugee in Greece until September of 1923. He arrived in America in October of 1923. He graduated from West Philadelphia High School in 1928 and from the Temple University Dental School in 1934. He married Deroohe Hamparian in 1940 and today they are blessed with three children (Lucy, Jovia, and Nerses Charles), six grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter, Mary Alice Keytanjian. In 1978 Dr. Mahjoubian was honored as a Follow of the Academy of General Dentistry. Over the years Dr. Mahjoubian has been continually active in the Knights of Vartan and has served and continues to serve the Armenian and American communities with his endless energy, dedication and straight talk.

"Celtic knight predates Columbus: Stone carving yields historic proof of 14th-century journey by Kurt Maurer The idea that Columbus was not the first European to set foot on North American soil is not new. Recent archeological findings make clear, however, that it is more factual than it was previously perceived to be. According to a book by Michael Bradley, Holy Grail Across the Atlantic, the Knights Templar was founded in 1118 A.D. under the name of the Order of the Poor Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon, 19 years after the capture of the Jerusalem during the First Christian Crusade. The Templars were an order of warrior-monks who played a crucial role in the Christian Crusades, fighting and dying by the thousands. They were the storm troopers in the siege of the Holy Land and fought to reclaim the sepulcher of Jesus Christ from the Muslim infidels. Their sole allegiance was to the Pope, and thus they were completely independent of the rule of any king, prince or prelate. They took a vow of poverty, obedience and chastity. The Templar's holdings proliferated as the sons of noble families throughout Europe flocked to the order. As well, wealthy Crusade supporters donated vast amounts of money, goods and land. All of their wealth, influence and independence were to be short-lived. By 1306, the Crusades were over and the Holy Land had fallen almost entirely under Muslim control. King Philip IV of France was determined to rid his country of the order. Armed with sufficient accusations to deliver his blow, the king issued secret orders to his agents throughout the country stipulating a simultaneous arrest of all the Templars in France at dawn on Friday, Oct. 13, 1307. The arrest was largely successful, but he failed to gain any of the riches. The Templars escaped to Scotland, where William Sinclair served as the Grand Master of Scottish Masons, appointed by King Robert the Bruce. Sinclair provided refuge for them at his castle, Rosslyn, near Edinburgh, Scotland. His grandson was Prince Henry Sinclair, who also served as Grand Master of Scottish Masons. Henry had amassed a fleet of ships in order to enable him to control the 200 islands in his Orkney kingdom. After recent study of an effigy on a rock in Westford, Mass., that was originally believed to be a chiseling of an Indian, scholars now believe it to be a portrait of James Gunn. In an interview with James P. Whittall, President of the Early Sites Research Society, Rowley, Mass., Whittall said, There are two elements in the effigy that trace its origin to Prince Henry Sinclair. The sword type, circa 1360, dates to the Scottish era, and the device on the shield is of a ship of a type developed in the northern isles of Scotland. Whittall also added that the age is determined by the sword type and the device - which point to the Clan Gunn circa 1350-1400. Sir James Gunn was a Knight Templar, as was his cousin, Prince Henry Sinclair. Also under study is a stone tower located in Newport, R.I. It is believed to be from the 13th century with European roots. Although many critics believe it is an old windmill, Pete Cummings Jr., a descendant of Prince Henry, and many others believe it has Scottish roots because of the construction and layout of the building. Another discovery is a cannon in Lewisburgh, Nova Scotia, that is believed to have been used by Prince Henry's navy around the Orkney Islands in the late 1300s. The cannon was first used on a ship by Carlow Zeno. Because of the evidence found in the Zeno Narratives, which was Sinclair's journal, it is known that Sinclair hired Carlow Zeno's two brothers to help his navy secure the Orkney Islands. From there, it is said, rumors of a rich and populous land spread across the Atlantic Ocean. Hence, Prince Henry formed an expedition of 200-300 Templars to find a new world in what was to become America. If there are those who are not fully convinced that Prince Henry conducted an expedition to the American continent in the late 1300s, there are those who have seen enough proof. Noting that this dating would mean that the Templars arrived a century before Columbus, Pete Cummings Jr. says, If 500 years is a long time, let me stand on the mountain tops and scream 600. Cummings also added, The pages of history books have long deprived our children of the truth. Illustration (drawing of ship on stone)","Maurer, Kurt",An Scathan,1997-08-31,0
"Harvard symposium evaluates seminal period in Ukraine's history On the eve of the sixth anniversary of Ukraine's independence, the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute (HURI) completed a yearlong project devoted to the examination of the first five years of an independent Ukraine with a conference, Ukraine Since independence: A Symposium on Politics, Economics, Society and Culture, held here July 31 August 2. Domestic issues Ukraine has come an enormous distance in the past five, six years, and the road taken has not been an easy one, began Bohdan Krawchenko of the Academy of Public Administration in Kyiv and an advisor to the office of the president of Ukraine, as he addressed the topic The National Government and Central Administration. Its relative successes should not be taken for granted - peaceful transitions, several elections, foreign policy, he added. However, reform-minded leaders understand that economic reform cannot move forward at this point without the reform of the political administration, he continued, and that one of the major blocks to economic reform is the lack of qualified government administrators to implement changes. There are too many Soviet-style technocrats with vested interests and not enough skilled managers, lawyers, budget planners. The current government structure also must be reorganized along functional lines and by policy areas, according to Dr. Krawchenko. For example, there should not be a Ministry of Statistics; data gathering should be an administrative function of the government. The goal is to reduce the more than 100 ministries and state committees to no more than 25. There is also an almost paralyzing duplication of effort within the executive branch, since the president's administration has appointed officials who take care of similar matters as their counterparts in the Cabinet of Ministers, or within ministries. Delineation of authority and responsibility are muddled. Ukraine still suffers from gaps in expertise, said Dr. Krawchenko, no real mechanism for developing, analyzing or revising public policy exists. Ukraine never had policy formulating bodies or experience; Ukraine had technocrats who carried out orders and fulfilled Moscow's plans. Changing management culture anywhere is difficult, conceded Dr. Krawchenko, and post-Soviet Ukraine was not a blank slate; the old system was not really fully destroyed and the task of transformation is often more complex than building anew. James Clem of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute addressed the topic Political Parties and Elites, and noted that the next election to Parliament will probably not be a watershed election for Ukraine, as were the parliamentary elections in 1990 or the presidential election of 1994. Political parties remain relatively weak; the election law is extremely cumbersome and detrimental to party development, said Dr. Clem, adding that no new revisions or changes are expected soon. The Communist and Socialist parties have retrenched after having suffered setbacks between 1990 and 1994. Nonetheless, in 1990 and in 1994, some regions had successes on local levels, in city and oblast council elections and elected reformers. The national Democratic Party and the Liberal Party are on track to revive the political center and take power away from the dominant left. Both centrist parties are organized along functional, practical lines, not ideological. Ukraine's brief history with open elections is good, it is important to have elections and since the process is a mechanism to force change. Interest groups function more like interest grabbers, seeking power and control, according to Margarita Balcemeda of the University of Toledo, speaking on the topic Interest Groups and the State. Informal interest groups (more colloquially referred to as clans or mafias) have developed by region and industry; they are loose and overlap, such as the steel, coal and gas industries, or the Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk and Crimea groups. There is not much activity from organized groups in the Western sense of interests groups, for example, ethnic or religious entities. Part of the problem, according to Dr. Balcemeda, may be that strong individual interest, the desire to maximize individual opportunity, is not yet strong in Ukraine. More formally organized interest groups are the Financial-Industrial Groups (FIGs). Vertically integrated from finance and management to supply, production and distribution, and organized according to industry sector, they have many critics who consider them to be monopolistic, quasi-private mechanisms of state control. According to Dr. Balcemeda, there is pressure in the Ukrainian legislature to give tax exemptions to Russian-Ukrainian joint ventures, especially to FIGs, and primarily Russian groups are pushing for these exemptions. There is also pressure internally in Ukraine, to not develop independent, national businesses, but to create trans-national FIGs, supra-state entities that cross the borders of the former Soviet republics. Reiterating a point made by Dr. Krawchenko in his presentation, Dr. Balcemeda stated that Ukraine cannot be compared to Poland, and especially not to Russia, because Ukraine never had even a basic independent infrastructure, a fact often forgotten by people who want to compare Ukraine to those countries in terms of civic, political and economic development. Roman Solchanyk, an analyst with the Rand Corporation who spoke to the topic of Ethnicity and Regionalism, stated that despite repeated dire predictions and warnings, there is still no evidence of inter-ethnic conflict in Ukraine. Based on survey data for all groups, Ukrainian, Russian, Jewish, the rates of perceived discrimination are low. In most cases, less than 10 percent (usually 3 to 8 percent) of the respondents felt they had been victims of discrimination. Exceptions were Russians who feel increased discrimination in western Ukraine (17 percent) and in Crimea (19 percent). Dr. Solchanyk speculated that some of this feeling among Russians can be attributed to the reversal of roles. This reversal is difficult for Russia, as well as for some Russians, to accept, and objective or imagined slights and diminished influence impacts how they feel. The Russian government continues to worry about Russians who live outside Russia proper (two committees exist in the Russian Duma, one to deal with the situation of Russians living in foreign countries, and one for those living in the near abroad) and continues to develop programs to help them. However, polls consistently show that most Russian voters don't really care about the 25 million Russians living abroad and that there is no real evidence that those living abroad need help. According to the surveys, dissatisfaction with independence in Ukraine comes from economic factors and not ethnic or regional conflicts; nonetheless, dormant fears remain. About 60 percent of respondents fear ethnic tensions could evolve. Dr. Solchanyk said he suspects this is a result of general feelings of insecurity and discomfort about economic and social changes, and is not rooted in ethnic hatred. Though respondents personally don't feel discrimination and would not participate in escalating tensions, they are afraid others might. As part of his presentation on Religion, Inter-Confessional Relations and Society, Dr. Andrew Sorokowski gave data published in the April edition of the journal Liudyna I Svit (Man and the Word) concerning the religious situation in Ukraine. Whereas in Poland, 83 percent of those surveyed claim to attend divine liturgy or prayer services at least one a month, only 20 percent in Ukraine, and 7 percent in Russia claim to do so. Nonetheless, 63.4 percent in Ukraine consider themselves to be religious believers, while 29.5 percent consider themselves to be non-believers, and 7.1 percent cannot decide. Of the religious organizations registered in Ukraine, 52 percent are Orthodox, 24 percent are Protestant, 17 percent are Greek-Catholic, 4 percent are Roman Catholic, 1 percent are Muslim, 0.5 percent are Jewish. This differs from the results obtained from individual respondents. Of those who claim any religious identity, 71.8 percent claim to be Orthodox, 17.5 percent to be Greek-Catholic, 5.3 percent to be Muslim, only 2.2 percent to be Protestant, 1.6 percent to be Roman Catholic, 1.2 percent simply believers and 0.4 percent Jewish. Though inter-confessional tensions have decreased over the past several years, in particular between Orthodox and Catholic, tensions between the Ukrainian Orthodox Churches, most notably between the Kyiv and Moscow Patriarchates continue. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate continues to claim the largest number of believers. More than 50 women's groups have formed in the past five years, based on community organizing principles and along interests such as health, welfare and children, said Martha Bohachevsky Chomiak, who spoke on the topic Women in Ukrainian Society. The situation is desperate in Ukraine in the areas of so-called traditional women's issues, with increases in abortion, illegitimate births, lack of contraceptives, low birth rate and high mortality. However, broader debate about, and actual changes in, men's and women's roles in society is not under way. (This point was reiterated later that evening at the students' roundtable where it was mentioned that feminism, the roles and responsibilities of men and women, concepts of exploitation and beauty were only beginning to be debated- sometimes hotly and often not well - among younger people). A new development is the loose coalition of women deputies that is forming in Parliament, especially around women's issues, and the former Minister of Family and Youth, Suzanna Stanik is perceived to be dynamic, unlike some of her Soviet-era predecessors. The national economy The economists. Ouch. These guys had nothing good to say. They all conceded that Ukraine faces extraordinary challenges, even overwhelming and often not manageable challenges. Despite the fact that other republics faced similar problems and also often achieved lackluster economic results, the four economists, nonetheless, all refused to grade on a curve and gave Ukraine failing marks in economics. The director of the Harvard Institute for International Development, Jeffrey Sachs, is a renowned proponent of using the strategy of economic shock therapy as the most effective way for former communist countries to complete a rapid transition to a market economy and international economic integration. Countries that adopted this approach and stuck with it for the past few years, such as Poland and Hungary, are now reaping the benefits. Countries that have refused to bite the bullet, such as Ukraine and Belarus, suffer from a dismal economic situation, a result that not only causes prolonged suffering for a nation's people, but can eventually threaten nationhood as well. Though Dr. Sachs, who spoke on the topic Economic Administration and Reforms, believes that restricting foreign investment by regulation or taxation impedes economic growth, he conceded that the fears many Ukrainians have about the unrestricted flow of Russian capital into Ukraine's economy is not without basis. So much of Russian capital right now, said Dr. Sachs, is non-transparent in its origin, its nature, its political linkages, such that capital is not capital in the Russian context, it is also political power. Institutions like Gazprom are not simply corporations, they are mechanisms of political control, mechanisms of policy. To the extent that investment of capital is transparent, that these are arms-length, market-based transactions that happen to be Russian, I don't see a problem. More than that, I think that it's natural, and that it is going to happen, that there would be Russian investment in Ukraine and Ukrainian investments in Russia. To the extent that there is a strong role of the state in quasi-private transactions, with heavy-handed politics in key infrastructure sectors, like natural gas, I see this as a risk. Daniel Kaufmann, also of the Harvard Institute for International Development, and formerly the director of the World Bank office in Kyiv, provided the conference participants with a detailed explanation of how the ubiquitous bribe impedes economic growth. Addressing Ukraine's Economic Performance, Dr. Kaufmann stated that though Ukraine has met many macro-economic goals, such as reducing budget deficits, reducing inflation, introducing a currency and stabilizing exchange rates, economic growth remains elusive. Dr. Kaufmann said he believes that not enough change has been implemented on the micro-economic level. There still is excessive regulation, licensing requirements, and high and inconsistent taxation that leads to strangulation of initiative or bribery, which in turn, fuel the shadow economy. Based on information acquired from interviews with new entrepreneurs, and correlating this with other data such as amount of electricity used, Dr. Kaufmann estimated that 50 percent of economic activity in Ukraine is in the shadow economy. From his interviews, Dr. Kaufmann learned, for example, that for a Kyiv businessman, each visit by a tax inspector or licensing agent results in the payment, on average, of a $90 unofficial fee (bribe) to avoid high taxes or an audit. However, a typical enterprise receives many of these visits in a year, and can pay up to $20,000 in unofficial payments. This amount is still lower than the tax owed, yet the state receives nothing, the tax collector receives everything and the business continues to work in the shadow, covering up its activity. Since true economic activity is not being reported, the economy appears to be unhealthy, and as a result, foreign investment stays away, and businesses take money out of the country. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the total cost of the unofficial fees that a new business could incur is a strong disincentive for new business start up and a bad use of capital. Most businessmen would be willing to pay lower taxes and be legitimate, according to Dr. Kaufmann, and the missing pillar in Ukraine's economic reform is reducing taxation, reforming licensing requirements and reducing regulations. Oleh Havrylyshyn of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) proposed that diversification of foreign trade is a key indicator of economies that are successfully undergoing the transition to a market-based economy. Speaking on Ukraine's Integration into the Global Economy, Dr. Havrylyshyn offered Poland as an example of a country that has consciously expanded and diversified foreign trade, and explained that this diversification parallels the rate and level of economic reform. Ukraine, which the IMF places in the group of slow reformers, has very undiversified foreign trade, on average, between 40 and 50 percent with countries of the former Soviet Union, while advanced reformers, countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia, have less than 10 percent with FSU countries. Though Russia will probably, naturally, always be a large trading partner for Ukraine, Ukraine would do well to balance out and diversify with the large markets of Europe as well, claimed Dr. Havrylyshyn. In response to Ukraine's arguments that those markets are closed, he noted that competitive Asian and Central European countries have gotten in, and that Ukraine's strategy of first learning competitiveness in the easy markets of the former USSR is misguided, since it runs the large risk of re-enforcing pre-existing trade and industrial ties instead of forging new ones. The period 1994-1995 was a critical window of opportunity to pass reforms, according to Anders Aslund of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, speaking on the topic Ukraine and International Financial Institutions. At that time, Ukraine carried a huge foreign debt, and its survival as a nation was in question. Michel Camdessus of the IMF, took advantage of the window of opportunity, Dr. Aslund noted, and visited Kyiv; the G-7 offered $4 billion to Ukraine as an incentive to reform. Several bold individuals, he added, such as Viktor Yuschenko, the former chairman of National Bank of Ukraine, took decisive action, for example, stopping credit emissions, and Yurii Yekhanurov, the former head of the State Property Fund, who performed a good privatization balancing act between competing interests. However, according to Dr. Aslund, with the exception of progress on privatization into 1996, since June 1995, let's face it, much has been attempted, but nothing done. There is a total reluctance to go forward. Economic problems, such as continued decline in GDP are not perceived as a threat to state, therefore the critical steps of tax reform and de-regulation are not being taken, he said. Dr. Aslund has given up expectations for the time being that President Kuchma is a reformer and claims that the proverbial poor organization of Ukrainian government as an impediment to economic reform is in fact a political choice, and exhibits a lack of political will. The former prime minister, the continued existence of the Cabinet of Ministers with an apparat of 800 people, and the new prime minister chosen can only be viewed as a choice to remain with bad government, according to Dr. Aslund. If Lazarenko was corrupt, then Pustovoitenko is the greatest bureaucrat - the second worst choice, he stated. The IMF and World Bank, which have been working with Ukraine on the development of economic and financial policies, have done a reasonable job, but only the next elections and continued pressure from the outside will work to force the current political elite to view economic stagnation as a threat that they must overcome. Later that evening, at a dinner at the Harvard Faculty Club, Prof. Roman Szporluk, director of the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, offered levity after a day of gloomy information and provided conference guests with a series of anecdotes on Ukrainian Independence in Historical Perspective. Quoting unnamed former Soviet experts and citing journalists and news reports, he led guests through an amusing game of which expert was expert enough to say something this dumb, and offered the observation that political scientists, and large, are a more cheerful lot than economists. Culture and society The final day of the conference focused on social problems and Ukrainian culture in a period of flux. Solomea Pavlychko of the Institute of Literature at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine confessed that while preparing for her topic, New Cultural Discourse and Literary Debates, she kept returning to only one event: the recent split within the Ukrainian Writer's Union. The Ukrainian Writer's Union (UWU), established in 1934, has often played the role of propagandist for the state, whether it was publishing prosaic poetry about tractors and happy workers under communism, publicizing more sophisticated broadsides against decadent capitalism, or promoting Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika. Publishing was controlled by the state, writer's were invited to join the UWU, and the state provided salaries and perks. At its congress in October 1996, the UWU continued in this political vein and declared that the building of Ukrainian statehood is the purpose of the organization. In turn, the leadership of the UWU expected to continue to receive state subsidies. According to Ms. Pavlychko, the split was the culmination a yearlong process, and the principled and very heated split highlighted the deep division among UWU members over the understanding of what is a writer, and around which principles to organize a union of writers. In March, the Association of Ukrainian Writers (AUW) was established. It has 100 members, compared to the UWU membership of 1,000. According to Ms. Pavlychko, the AUW is interested in adhering to practices adopted by trade and professional writers' organizations in the West, where writing is a creative, and not a political, profession. As writers. We do not want to belong to the state, she noted. For those who have traveled do Ukraine and wondered why authors don't band together and hold book fairs to sell books that are often unavailable in stores, the answer is: the state. In order to sell and distribute books, one needs a state-approved license. Providing an example of the type of excessive regulation and licensing that strangles economic activity described by Dr. Kaufmann a day earlier, Ms. Pavlychko explained that authors do not have the right to openly sell their work without a license. Concurring with Ms. Pavlychko's assessment that the old system of government support is no longer in place for artists, and those who once worked under it are having a hard time letting go, composer and professor Virko Baley of the University of Nevada claimed he understood these artists' pain. After all, the life of a Soviet artist/musician/composer was very good - housing, vacations, retreats paid for, time to create - conditions unheard of in the West for most composers and musicians. Speaking about the state of Performing and Fine Arts, Prof. Baley said that besides music and composition, the art of filmmaking is in dire straits. Film is the art from of the 20th century according to Prof. Baley, and what little PR Ukraine received in the creative world was from films. Ukraine once produced 20 to 30 films a year, it now produces five. The famed Dovzhenko Studio basically doesn't exist anymore. Ukraine is undergoing a talent drain, as well. The Jewish emigration for the past 10 years, and more recently a non-Jewish emigration, is leaving to play, teach, compose, and direct elsewhere in order to survive. Performing companies that tour, said Prof. Baley, are more likely to survive; foreign tours often provide stipends and cover expenses, more than Ukraine can provide. On a bright note, Prof. Baley cited commercial theater: Broadway-style productions are now being produced for the Novoye Russki (nonveau-riche); this entertainment for the new elite is popular and profitable and includes such productions as Carmen, arranged more like a musical than a traditional opera. Another trend, noted Prof. Baley, is art as a chic aquisition for the nouveau-riche. An attitude of My friends are buying a soccer team, so instead, I'll buy myself an orchestra is beginning to take hold. Similar conditions exist in all the arts as Ukraine makes a transition to living by the profit motive and defines issues such as state support vs. state control and the proper role of the benefactor. Yuri Shevchuk of the New School for Social Research introduced a topic that is as controversial as the issue of eubonics in the U.S. He says that he believes surzhyk (pidgin Ukrainian) is not an linguistic aberration, but a viable tongue of discourse for millions of Ukrainians. Speaking on the topic of Identity and Language in Ukraine, Mr. Shevchuk put a spin on the definition of surzhyk: It's difficult to define surzhyk; I can't say. But like the definition of pornography, I know it when I hear it. Surzhyk can't be written, therefore it does not have a major attribute of a language. Mr. Shevchuk contended that Ukrainian is spoken by only a minority of the population, and that surzhyk, a synthesis of grammatically broken Ukrainian and Russian is more prevalent. Even though it is the tongue of low prestige, discussions about national consciousness are taking place in surzhyk and are associated with it. Many people who speak surzhyk think they are speaking Ukrainian, he said. He continued that, for some, speaking Russian or Ukrainian is a political act, while speaking surzhyk is an easy way out of the war. It is being heard more in pop music, and in new Broadway-style entertainment. Even some sophisticated youth at the prestigious and competitive National University of the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy claim that surzhyk is their primary language. Surzhyk appears to be acquiring a veneer of hipness, though Mr. Shevchuk correlated (albeit, in a somewhat confused manner) the use of surzhyk with the remnants of Soviet self-identity in Ukraine. Ukraine is in a stage of national myth-making, said Dr. Krawchenko as he addressed the topic Historical Consciousness and National Identity. The major vehicle for disseminating information about historical consciousness is the media, not historians and intellectuals, and some of the new accepted truths include: 1) Ukraine is descendant from Kyivan Rus'; 2) the Hetman state was a Ukrainian state; 3) Mykhailo Hrushevskyi was Ukraine's first president; 4) Ukraine is a European nation. According to Dr. Krawchenko, President Kuchma has stated that one of the most important aspects of the NATO-Ukraine charter was that NATO recognized Ukraine as a European nation. After Dr. Oleh Wolowyna completed his presentation (see article on page 9). Alexander Motyl of Columbia University provided a conclusion to the conference sessions with his presentation Independent Ukraine in Comparison with Other Post-Soviet States. Ukraine, according to Dr. Motyl, fairly consistently appears in the middle of various rankings of the Central European and CIS countries by organizations such as the IMF or World Bank, Freedom House or The Economist. Given that this distribution by groupings tends to reflect a pattern, (Ukraine is usually grouped in with Moldova, Belarus and Russia, the middle countries) and given that these three or four cluster (Baltics to Slovenia; the countries of the Caucusus and the East; and then the middle countries) have been fairly consistent for four to five years, Dr. Motyl claims that problems are systemic, and not simply a matter of political will. It is unreasonable to assume, for example, that Central Europe has political will, while Central Asia has none, and `middle countries' have it only upon occasion, he continued, the uniformity of trend suggests that more than lack of political will and bad policy are to blame for endemic problems in Ukraine, as well as other post-communist countries. Other factors that could be considered as influencing the success of transition, include a country's proximity to Europe, cultural history and the length of time under totalitarian or imperial rule. The fact that Ukraine is located between Europe and Russia also plays a role because Ukraine's stability is tied to the stability of neighbors. He chastised analysis for participating in the fetish of economic policy and claimed that Ukraine may not be a market economy turning the corner, but it is not bad on nation-building. He underscored that Ukraine has managed to avoid authoritarian solutions to solve its problems and has pursued a relatively balanced development. Echoing the sentiment behind an old Ukrainian proverb that a good beginning is half the success, one participant noted that if one assumes that a state is a necessary precondition to a healthy economy, then the experience of Ukraine in the past five years has been at least a 50 percent success; if one assumes that the economy is a necessary precondition to a healthy state, then Ukraine has been a 100 percent failure. The conference received many accolades from the participants, including more than 40 business representatives, academicians, representatives from U.S. and Canadian government agencies, members of the media, private individuals, associates of other Harvard University programs, graduate students and participants of Harvard's summer training program for professionals. Claiming that he opted for the 50 percent success verdict, Dr. Lubomyr Hajda of the HURI, the primary organizer of the symposium, as well the manager as of HURI's yearlong program on the fifth anniversary of independence (which included a major conference in Washington, published materials and special lectures), offered the thought that on the eve of the sixth anniversary, it's not too early to look ahead and make plant to examine, in an academic way, the first 10 years of Ukraine's independence.

"A letter to friends on the occasion of the second World Forum of Ukrainians Being back in America for the first time in two years, I had a chance to reacquaint myself with the Ukrainian American press and was struck by how much and how little has changed. As I will soon be returning to take part in the second World Forum of Ukrainians and to teach full time in Kyiv, I would like to take this opportunity to share a few perceptions with you, my old friends, about what I have learned during my years of living with the citizens or Ukraine on the same basis as they do. At the end of the month, when Ukrainians of various stripes meet in Kyiv to have their say, there is sure to be a great deal of soul searching; we are sure to hear the phraseology, once confined to the diaspora and now customary for national democrats, about the eternal virtues of Nenka Ukraina, her endless sufferings, the beauties of her language, the glories of her culture, the triumphs and tragedies of her history. The old stereotypes about heroic Ukrainians battling against evil Russians for control of the state don't really fit the far more complex realities of a land and people deeply deformed by an experience that those who underwent it are still groping to understand. Frankly, they have deformed tools for doing so. One of the great dividing lines of culture runs through Ukraine - not the division between a Catholic-Protestant West and Orthodox-Muslim East, so popular with certain American political scientists - but the chasm left by the old pre-1939 Soviet Western border. West of that line, in Lviv as in Poland, the Soviet government never lost the psychological attributes of an occupation regime in the eyes of most of the population. But East of it - where whole generations where born, raised, lived and died knowing nothing else - what was called a new historical entity, the Soviet people, assumed more reality and emotional content than anyone here, myself included, really understood. The destruction or, more precisely, deconstruction of Ukrainian society in the USSR during the 1930s created a historical discontinuity, rooting out the world of Hrushevsky and Yefremov, of Khvylivyi and the young Sosiura, and artificially replacing it with an alternative reality and identity of which a great many people became so accustomed that it became altogether natural for them. The concept of the Soviet people, whose existence was decreed from above in the 1930s, gained real emotional content in World War II. The experience of advancing to liberate Kyiv and on the Berlin shoulder to shoulder with Russians and the other Soviet peoples made the Great Patriotic War for the Fatherland for a whole generation of frontovyky (those who were at the front) their victory. Thus, in the eyes of many such people the Soviet Union had far more legitimacy than independent Ukraine has today. Moreover, while western Ukraine presents a sociologically complete and relatively healthy national society, in the regions of Ukraine, along the Dnipro River, where 85 percent of the population lives, the urban population got out of the habit of using the Ukrainian language, at least at home. But then, in Ukraine language is no indicator of political convictions. My acquaintances assure me that a decade ago the supernationalist leader of UNSO (Ukrainian National Self-Defense Organization), Dmytro Korchynsky, did not speak Ukrainian. Yet even before independence, the journal Sociological and Political Thought published a survey indicating that 90 percent of the population of Kyiv has at least some understanding of Ukrainian, and only rarely in Kyiv does a salesgirl mistake the Ukrainian dvi for the Russian tri (although it still happens). In a society where virtually everyone is to some extent bilingual and people use one language for some occasions and another for others, a certain chameleon-like quality seeps into people's personal lives. There are many ways to understand what a nation is. Form the standpoint of how people subjectively understand who they are 1980s an American professor, Benedict Anderson, suggested that they might well be understood as imagined communities who adopted their modern national identification (consciousness) only in the last century or two. After all, modern research shows that the majority of the ancestors of today's Frenchmen or Germans had no idea that they were French or German even 150 years ago. In a world where most people were illiterate peasants who tilled the soil among people like themselves and never traveled more than 10 miles or so in their lifetimes, most people did not need nor could they develop a modern national consciousness. The latter arose only as a result of the complex pressures of modernity. In this subjective sense, there are really two nations two imagined communities in today's Ukraine: Ukrainians and the Soviet people - in Sovietese, Sovky - the former concentrated in, but by no means limited to, western Ukraine, that latter concentrated in pre-1939 Soviet Ukraine. Strangely enough, it is difficult in Ukraine to find a Russian imagined community, for all the efforts of Oleksander Bazyliuk's Civic Congress and the Congress of Russian Organizations (he heads both), because Russians in Ukraine simply do not feel that they are not at home (in spite of propaganda that the Russian language is, as Mr. Bazyliuk claims, effectively banned) - even with what seems to many Ukrainians an agonizingly slow and superficial velvet Ukrainization of the state apparatus and official mass media. Unlike in the Baltic states, Russians in Ukraine have not felt the outside pressure that would compel them to form a Russian imagined community as such. One need only took at the fact that all attempts to organize purely Russian mass political movements have fallen flat. Rather, the Left with its yearnings for a return to the good old days of the USSR, cuts across purely ethnic categories and is led by such passport Ukrainians as Oleksander Moroz and Petro Symonenko. This leads one to conclude that the nationality written in one's old Soviet passport means little or nothing in understanding the political and social realities of contemporary Ukraine. If the emotional cornerstone of the old Soviet identity and living heroes were provided by the war, the structural origins of the contemporary Ukrainian state come, not from a return to the ideals of the Ukrainian National Republic, but from the Khrushchev reforms of the 1950s. To paraphrase the argument made by the late Ivan L. Rudnytsky back in 1963, the shift in budge allocation policy from Stalinist hypercentralization to one of devolution to the republics (in 1952 the union republics accounted for only 20 percent of the USSR's told budgetary expenditures, but by 1958 the figure was over 50 percent) created strong republic territorial elites, fated to grow into the soil of their respective republics, but still as products of the communist system and bereft of any national sentiments. Structures, once formed, resist change. When the center fell apart, representatives of this same elite in Ukraine, initially looking to the national elite (primarily national democrats) for a new ideology and adapting themselves according to the character of their local environment (more Red in the east and south, more Red in the east and south, more Ukrainian in the west), remained the dominant political factor in independent Ukraine. The fact that both presidents of independent Ukraine were colleagues on the last Soviet-era Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine in the Ukrainian SSR, while messrs. Symonenko and Moroz were but regional functionaries, is an obvious indicator that Ukraine's ruling establishment institutionally is more a continuation of Soviet Ukraine than those who ostensibly want to return to the Soviet past. Sovdepia (a less than found abbreviation for the land of the councils of deputies going back perhaps to the wars of the Russian Revolution), to paraphrase Marx, is that dead hand of past generations hanging like a curse on the brain of the living. It has deformed Ukraine in other complex and profound ways. There were no such things in the USSR as economics, political science or the social sciences in general, political science or the social sciences in general. They were long ago supplanted by ideologized pseudo-sciences with Orwellian terminology such as political economics and something called scientific communism, which perfectly suited the Soviet ancien regime but provided previous little of use for understanding how the world outside the socialist camp really works. Suffice it to recall how Dmytro Vydrin, former internal affairs adviser to the president of Ukraine, and Dmytro Tabachnyk, former head of the presidential administration, wrote in the first paragraph of the first chapter of their book, Ukraine on the Threshold of the 21st Century Political Aspects, that Ukraine, like other post-Soviet states, lacks a civil society in its generally understood meaning, i.e. that most citizens share the same basic values, moral behavior patterns and such. Given that civil society is in fact generally understood as a network of institutions independent of government and capable of influencing it, we have a situation where, say, these then prominent political figures could speak with a Western aid administrator and agree that Ukraine lacks and should immediately create a civil society, blissfully unaware that what each had thought he had said was quite different from what the other thought he had heard and agreed with. And this could he extended to such concepts as democracy, rights, market economy, reforms, fighting corruption and on down - a virtually endless list resulting in the fact that each side sooner or later feels lied to. This drives Western aid officials, often with no prior knowledge of the country and the system it has inherited, to distraction. One American agricultural expert described to me a typical business plan drawn up at the Ministry of Agriculture to privatize the agro-industrial complex: the national government would team a 20 percent interest, the regions another 20 percent, management and local entities 20 to 25 percent, leaving a non-controlling stock package to be offered to private investors. This would mean that the whole operation would not only be controlled by bureaucrats, but by representatives of different bureaucracies which never have and never will work efficiently together. And I couldn't make them understand why this is insane, he said. Behind this is not just the imperatives of bureaucrats seeking to retain their functions and power, and thus their jobs. The Soviet mentality has ingrained the notion that only the state can protect the people (whoever that might be) from exploitation. As one national deputy recently put it. I'm not for investment for its own sake nut that it improve the functioning of domestic (read existing) enterprises. Western economist might reply that enterprises also don't exist for their own sake but to efficiently produce goods and services, thus making it possible to pay employees more money, create demand, more jobs and more wealth, and that less efficient businesses ought to go bankrupt, shut down and thus free up resources for more effective use, thereby improving the well-being of society as a whole. This is not to say that there are no competent experts in Ukraine. Although they are a minority, there are plenty. But the crisis of competence reigning as a result of the dominance among local advisers of repackaged scientific communists cum political scientists, repackaged political economists masquerading as economists, and other such creatures, has rendered such would-be reformers as Viktor Pynzenyk and Serhii Holvatyi virtually impotent. I remember one competent economist, who out of a desire to earn an apartment took a government job (the fact that one works in order to be awarded housing rather than to buy it is one symptom of what is wrong) and left after six months without one. When I asked him what happened, he said. Jim, you have to understand that economics just didn't exist here. We had political economy, and that's something altogether different. So, on any given issue there may be, say, 60 advisers (yet another symptom), and maybe 10 of them understand something and suggest some concrete step. But the other 50 with identical paper qualifications don't understand anything. And, Since the decision-makers also don't understand anything, they just go with the majority.","Mace, James E",Ukrainian Weekly,1997-08-24,0
"Nagorno-Karabagh Republic is Already A De-Facto Independent State Each time Azeri dictator Heydar Aliyev repeats like a parrot that he can only grant the highest degree of self-rule, but he cannot permit the formation of a second Armenian state on Azeri soil, he is deluding himself. No one asked for his permission to give independence to the heroic people of Karabagh; the Karabaghis got their independence after decisive victories in the battles of Shushi, Kelbajaar, Kubatly, Zangelan and Fizuli, after inflicting a heavy blow to intruding Azeri forces. Perhaps Aliyev needs to be reminded that, when the Azeri forces aided by the former Soviet interior ministry troops were conducting mopping-up operations, and forcefully evacuating the Armenian villagers from their ancestra homes, the politicians in Baku were promising the Azeri mob that the Azeri leadership would soon swim in the waters of Lake Sevan, revealing their true sinister intentions: to put an end to the Armenian presence in Nagorno-Karabagh, and even invade Armenia; to join with Turkey; to make the PanTurkist and Pan-Turanist dreams come true, creating high expectations in Ankara. After sustaining decisive defeats on the battlefield, the Azeri leadership agreed to sue for a ceasefire and sit at the negotiating table. Now that the US and Western interests have increased in the region on account of the oil, Azeris have changed their tactics and have become more demanding and confident. FAULTY AND DANGEROUS AZERI POLICIES The Azeris are overplaying the oil card, overestimating Western interest, and underestimating the Russian and Iranian factors. They are making fatal mistakes, thinking that Western investments will do away with their economic and social ills overnight. Little do they realize that with Western money and technology, Western ideas and philosophies will follow, radically changing the stagnant Azeri society new ideas of freedom, democracy, and free expression, directly challenging the corrupt and dictatorial Azeri leadership. Aliyev and his followers then will have more worries with their own people than with the Armenians. These kinds of new Western ideas, democracy, freedom, and expression played a major role in the demise of the Soviet Union and created ethnic wars in the Kurdish regions of Turkey, as well as the collapse of Eastern Europe's communist regimes. Of course, this is their problem, not ours. In these regions rich in fossil oil and natural gas, the diverse geopolitical and economic interests of major and minor, regional or global powers are overlapping, creating conditions for conflict rather than intended cooperation. The struggle for hegemony is creating hotbeds of ethnic conflict and future wars. The major players of the Great Game are US, Russia, Turkey and Iran; the price is oil; the pawns are the Kurds, Chechens, Abkhazians, Ossetians, Ajarians, Lezghis, Talishes, Avars, Georgians, Armenians, Azeris, Afghans, Turkmens, and Uzbeks. Let's analyze the origin of the Karabagh conflict, the objectives of the major players, and the role of the minor players. AGAIN ON THE CONFLICT'S ORIGIN Nagorno Karabagh - Artsakh - is undisputed Armenian territory, arbitrarily given to the artificially created Soviet Azerbaijan by Joseph Stalin. Never before did any Azeri state exist in this region. Armenians composed 90 percent of Karabagh's population in 1923 but, with Baku's discriminatory anti-Armenian policy, the number of Armenians dropped to 78 percent in 1988. Then, after the demise of USSR, they faced the threat of mass deportation; in fact, the northern section of Nagorno-Karabagh, which represents 19 percent of the Karabagh territory, is still occupied by Azeri forces. The war between Karabagh Armenians and Azeris over this disputed territory started after Azeri aggression against the Armenian villages, towns, and cities, causing the death of 17,000. Azerbaijan is falsely declaring that Armenian forces occupy 20 percent of the Azeri territory and that, as result of the war, there are one million Azeri refugees. The exaggeration of these figures by the Azeri leadership indicates they are not interested in serious negotiations; on the contrary, they are using the propaganda ploy and deceiving world public opinion to present the Armenians as the bad boys. The truth is, only 7 percent of Azeri territory - the Security Zone - is under the control of the Armenian forces, while 13 percent of the stated figure represents the territory of NKR, within the boundaries of the former Karabagh Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic. This territory's autonomous status was protected by the former Soviet constitution; then, unilaterally and arbitrarily, it was revoked by the Azeris, and the deportation of the Armenians was started following pogroms and massacres of the Armenians in Baku, Sumgait, and Kirovabad (Ghandja), creating 350,000 Armenian refugees. The stated number of one million Azeri refugees is also not correct. The total number is 650,000 and Aliyev is intentionally keeping them under tents instead of giving vacant former Armenian houses, for political reasons - to show that his people are suffering, for public consumption locally and internationally; by thus playing with human lives, the Azeri dictator once more is proving his disregard for human life and dignity. Naturally, the Azeris conveniently forget that they occupy 19 percent of Nagorno-Karabagh in the north, yet nothing is mentioned about this Azeri occupation. DICTATED BY OIL POLITICS Azerbaijan's foreign policy, and Aliyev's approach to the Karabagh issue, is based on oil politics. His strategy is to register the support of the giant multinational oil companies, force the regional and global powers to compete for oil, and ask the governments of the US, Russia, UK, and France to exert the maximum pressure on Armenia and Karabagh to accept Azeri sovereignty in Nagorno-Karabagh. The promise of granting a high degree of autonomy to the Karabaghis is only a propaganda ploy to bring the presently Armenian-controlled territory under Azeri rule. Once he achieves this objective, the Azeris will be the owners of the land while the tenants, the Armenians of Karabagh, will be dealt with accordingly, and the Nakhichevanization of Karabagh will begin. In 1960, under Aliyev, the depopulation of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic from its Armenian inhabitants was complete. This Azeri dictator wants to duplicate this depopulation policy in Karabagh, make no mistake about it. International guarantees? Armenians have seen enough of these guarantees - in the Treaty of Berlin and the San Stefano Treaty, and subsequently the Treaty of Sevres, followed by more deportations and genocide. The Azeri dictator is getting more bold and careless. His blunders at Georgetown University - unkind remarks about Russia and Iran - did not go unnoticed, however. According to RFE/RL radio broadcast in Prague on August 12, 1997, the Azeri strongman remarked in his meeting with three US senators in Baku that Moscow had repeatedly offered to liberate the districts of Azerbaijan currently under control of Karabagh Armenian forces, in return for the right to station Russian troops in Azerbaijan. Furthermore, according to Azerbaijan's Turan agency, Aliyev constantly rejected this proposal, proposing instead that the US assume the role of guarantor of the independence of the former Soviet republics. (According to a report in the August 16, 1997 issue of Respublika Armeniyi daily, Yuri Yukalov, Russian co-chairman of OSCE Minsk Group, said that Baku's reports about Moscow's promises to liberate territories occupied by Karabagh troops, in exchange for stationing of Russian military bases in Azerbaijan, are provocations) This remarkable conversion of the former Russian servant, Russia's lackey to America's strategic partner, reveals the character of the man, motivated by a hunger for power, greed and vengeance, who will not hesitate to eliminate any obstacles in the path to achieving his goals, no matter what - this is Heydar Aliyev, the man for all seasons. I wonder what Moscow's reaction to these allegations will be. What was Aliyev's motivation to make such a statement? Was it to embarrass Russia by putting her in a compromising situation, to create a wedge between Russia and Armenia, or to please the US, showing that Azerbaijan is the only country in the region which is a true friend of the West? Does he have he strength to challenge Russia? Meanwhile, the US reminded Aliyev that he has to improve human rights in Azerbaijan and he was told to accelerate the democratization process and respect the rights of minorities. This note must have had a cold-shower effect on this Azeri dictator, who is so confident that his country's oil wealth is sufficient to mute any criticism of his dictatorial regime, and that he has a carte blanche to do whatever he wishes. He often violates the principles of international diplomacy. He is cunning, mercurial, dangerous and cannot be trusted, period. CONCISE ANALYSIS OF PLAYERS' POSITIONS Turkey: Turkey sees opportunities to expand her political, military, and economic influence to the East, in the Turkic-speaking former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Turkey sees opportunities for the realization of Pan-Turkish and pan-Turanist dreams, long cherished by the nationalist forces in Ankara and Baku. Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey Bulent Ecevit stated that if Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan are united (over the Armenian territory of Zangezur in southeastern Armenia - M.A.), Turkey will have the opportunity to extend itself to the Caspian Sea and Central Asia. Loud and clear. President of Turkey Suleyman Demirel was quoted calling the territory of Zangezur cursed territory, preventing Turkie geographical unity. If the reader remembers, Paul Goble wanted to give Zeangezur to the Azeris in exchange for Karabagh, but this proposal was rejected by Armenia. The Turks are supporting the Chechen separatists in Russia, the Muslim population in Ajaria, Georgia, to take control of the port of Batumi, vital for Armenia's trading with Russia, Ukraine, and Europe. The Turks are also instigating unrest among the Azeri population in Iran, twenty million strong, trying to prevent independence for the Karabagh Armenians, and they are trying to suffocate Kurdish self-determination movements to eliminate obstacles in their path in order to secure Pan-Turkish and Pan-Turanist agendas. The genocide of the 1.5 million Armenians in 1915-23 was a direct result of the first phase of this grand Turkish plan; elimination of the Armenian factor in the Caucasus is in progress, but the Karabagh independence movement is foiling this plan. Iran: Iran, with its twenty million Azeri population, feels vulnerable, equally threatened by the Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist movement. The bitter memories of several Turkish-Iranian wars, fought for the control of the Armenian Highland (Armenian Knot), mountains of Kurdistan, Caucasus and Aderbadagan Sharki and Gharbi (Northern and Eastern Azerbaijan), are still vivid in the minds of Iranians. Iran therefore sees it security enhanced by a strong Armenia and Karabagh. Iran is providing electricity, and pipelines to deliver Turkmenistan's natural gas to Armenia are under construction. Trade relations between Armenia and Iran are expanding, Armenia is giving an opportunity to Iran to trade with Ukraine, Russia and the Balkans, and Iran is giving an opportunity for Armenia to gain access to the Persian Gulf and Arabian markets. Iran is against the placement of foreign peacekeepers in Nagorno-Karabagh, and now Iran and the West are in process of warming up their relations, which takes the heat and pressure off of Armenia, since realization of multiple oil pipelines, dreams of the oil companies now can be realized over the territory of Iran. Armenia-Iran co-operation is contributing to regional and world peace, while checking Turkish expansionism in the West and Azeri expansionism in the East. Iran is becoming the most strategically important country in the region, offering the most for the Newly Independent States (NIS) in terms of trade and security. However, contrary to Turkey, Iran does not intend to establish hegemony, and is not threatening any nation's independence. Russia: The problem with Russia is that there are three different forces acting like three different governments, pursuing different foreign policy goals and objectives, causing confusion and instability. President Boris Yeltsin pretends to be in change, yet most of his decrees and decisions are far from implementation. The defense establishments and general are conducting their foreign policy, and the military leadership keep changing. The humiliation of the Russian army in Chechnya, the big clamor over the so- called clandestine Russian arms delivery to Armenia, the declaration of Aman Tuleyev, and General Lev Rokhlin's several visits to Baku reflect disarray in Russia's foreign policy and the inability of President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin to control their subordinates. The business establishments of Russia, especially the giant oil industry largely comprised of pro-Azeri Lukoil and Rusneft, are also pursuing their own independent policy. Under pressure by Turkmenistan, the recent cancellation of the Russian-Azeri oil agreement to exploit Kyapaz oil fields is the victim of Russia's foreign policy blunders. In the Caucasus, Russia wants military bases, economic control, and a greater share in oil investments and over the oil pipelines. The Russians successfully used Abkhazian and Ossetian cards to force Georgia to grant base rights to Russian Amed Forces, used the Karabagh conflict to secure military bases in Armenia, and they are now using the Karabagh conflict again to force Azerbaijan into Russia's orbit. Russia considers the Caucasus and Central Asia their sphere of influence, and they want to have their cake and eat it too at the same time, especially in Karabagh. Andranik Mihranian is correct in his political analysis entitled Russia May Be Thrown Out of the Transcaucasus, Like it Was Thrown Out of the Balkans (TAR Int'l, August 9, 1997, p. 21). He point out therein the danger that Russia is facing against Turkish expansionism. Russia is weary of the Turkish threat, and penetration by the US and the West into its economic interest zone in the Caucasus and Central Asia, yet remains impotent to meet the challenges. Russia's constant retreat thus exposes Armenia and NKR to the Turkish-Azeri joint threat. Georgia: Under the threat of disintegration, Georgia sees the opportunities to have oil pipelines cross its territory and to form an alliance with Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Turkey. Aware of the Armenian majority in its southern district of Akhalkalak and Akhaltsikhe (Javakh region), next to Armenia, Georgia is supporting Azerbaijan's position in Nagorno-Karabagh, while giving lip service to Georgian -Armenian friendship and cooperation; she is actually cooperating with Azerbaijan and Turkey in order to undermine the Armenian national struggle in Nagomo-Karabagh. Georgia remains an unreliable neighbor as she follows a dubious foreign policy. U.S.A.: On the surface, the US policy consists of the following agenda: promotion of democracy, creation of free market economy, sponsorship of peace and cooperation within and among the countries of the region, and their integration within the larger international community. On the darker side, the Cold War continues, having the following objectives: promotion of Turkish-Azeri interests, giving the Turkic states the assignment to contain Russia and Iran, through the multiple oil pipeline project, to prevent Russia from maintaining its control over the oil transportation routes, in order to sustain the independence of the Central Asian Turkic republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan. The Armenian factor is considered to be unimportant, for policy makers of the foreign policy establishment, the oil companies, and their hired former US government officials are trying to neutralize the Armenian influence on Congress and eliminate the Karabagh factor with cosmetic promises, like self-rule, while keeping the territory's legal status within Azerbaijan, and force the Armenians to remain subordinate to Baku's rulers. Armenia: Armenia is caught between the competing world of hegemonist oil companies, geopolitical games, regional and global rivalries, ethnic unrest and revolutions. She has huge domestic problems in the economic and social sectors, in the earthquake disaster zone; she is infested with mismanagement, corruption, and personal rivalries between local and diaspora-controlled politicians; and now is under foreign pressure to make concessions in the Karabagh issue. All in all, Armenia is going through a very difficult period. The upcoming visit of President Levon Der Bedrosian to Washington is occurring at the worst time. The election controversies of September 1996, the violent street demonstrations by the opposition, the disruption of the internal tranquillity made him vulnerable and weak, which may bring temptations to the circles controlled by the oil lobbyists to pressure him for further concessions; namely, to accept Azeri sovereignty in Nagomo-Karabagh, and be satisfied with self-rule, which we all know is a trap, providing Armenians in Karabagh neither security nor freedom nor economic prosperity. Once again, the new sultans in Baku and Ankara will control the destiny of the Armenian nation. Therefore, the visit by Armenian Prime Minister Robert Kocharian will be more useful, since he was a broad appeal and commands respect in all segments of Armenian society, in the homeland, NKR, and the Diaspora as well. He has a better chance of resisting political pressures, and his words will be more carefully listened to. Once the groundwork is lid by Prime Minister Kocharian, the follow-up visit by President LDB will be more successful. We in the Diaspora have the responsibility to make their visits more successful than that of Aliyev, to show that we are more powerful than the paid former government officials working for the oil companies and Heydar Aliyev's interests. The hint in Hayastani Hanrapetutyun daily [Republic of Armenia], that Armenia's government is preparing the public for concessions, is a dangerous one, for NKR's independence is the only solution for long-term and lasting stability. Even Paul Goble recognized this in his last political analysis in RFE/ RL on August 16, 1997. Nagorno-Karabagh: In the middle of these geopolitical games, regional and global power games, the people of Nagorno-Karabagh are being victimized by geography and history. They fought gallantly and defeated their oppressors on the battlefield. They are already a de-facto independent functioning state, with established government, armed forces, social and domestic services capable of controlling their political life. They are ready to have horizontal relations with Armenia and, according to Foreign Minister of NKR Arkady Ghukasian, the leading candidate for president of NKR, Karabagh is ready to enter into relations with Azerbaijan, provided that these are based on equal rights. Equal rights, not subordination, is what the brave people of Karabagh are asking for, and we all should support this. Where does one see any nation trading its independence for subordination? Nowhere! It is about time that the new sultan in Baku, Heydar Ali Rizaoglu Aliyev, Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, the Turkish generals in Ankara, and Bill Clinton in Washington realize this. The Karabaghis are not asking for more than de jure recognition of their de-facto independence, which they have had already for the last six years. If Turkey can recognize the independence of self-proclaimed Northern Turkish Cyprus Republic, there is no harm in Armenia recognizing the independence of her sister Republic of NKR. This is not an annexation; it is recognition of the reality, de-facto independence of the NKR. It is fatal to enter any war without the will to win it. (General Douglas Mac Arthur) Maintaining Karabagh within Azeri borders, and subordinating the Armenians of NKR to Azeri authority...you will achieve only one thing, the resumption of large-scale hostilities...which may involve Russia and Turkey.

"Dancing Wolves and Lousy Liars A lie spreads like wildfire, whereas the truth is revealed very slowly or A lies can go around the world and back while the truth is lacking up its boosts. These proverbs sum up Azeri President Heydar Aliyev's act and performance at Georgetown University of July 30, 1997. The so-called lecture program was staged by the oil companies and their paid lobbyists, Ambassador Richard L. Armitage, and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski from the Center for Stragegic and International Studies, as part of a public-relations campaign to promote the interests of Azerbaijan and oil companies. From the introductory biography of Aliyev, and the partisan audience, to the meticulously pre-arranged friendly questions, the stage was set to present the former KGB chief and communist dictator as a pro-Western, pro-democratic and pro-American leader. his oil-rich country was described as a strategic region; therefore, preservation of Azerbaijan's independence and territorial integrity was considered to be a US national security issue. A SUGAR-COATED BIOGRAPHY According to his published biography, Aliyev renounced Soviet communism, but history indicates otherwisel; he was fired from the Politburo on charges of corruption and embezzlement. Nothing was mentioned about his coming to power through a coup d'etat, his political campaign to eliminate political rivals, his censorship of state radio and television, his silencing of the news media, and his gross human-rights violations. Most striking was the posture and action of Brzezinski and Armitage, who both behaved like Aliyev's stooges. They both looked like fools, nodding their heads affirmatively every time dictator Aliyev asked for the elimiation of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, presented Armenia as an aggressor state, accused Armenia of occupying 20 percent of Azeri territory, or stated that there were 1 million Zeri refugees as a result of the Karabagh war. The audience was made up of oil executives, paid lobbyists, financiers, investors, academics, journalists, and Azeri-Turkish propagandists; for some inexplicable reason, the Armenian presence was no more than four people. If there had been 20 Armenians in the audience, they could have posed many questions in writing, causing embarrassment to Aliyev and the organizers of this propaganda blitzkreig. ISSUES RAISED AND SKIRTED Nevertheless, thanks to the handful of Armenians present, issues of human- rights violations, oppresson of minorities, corruption and bribery were raised. The issues of Karabagh and Nakhichevan were also brought to this pro-Azeri forum, causing dismay and anger to the dictator. Heydar Aliyev is a crafty politician and excellent communicator, who knows how to control a crowd, but he remains a lousy liar. Any individual who is well informed about Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabagh, Armenia, and the 'Great Game and oil politics, could easily detect Aliyev's historicdal, political, and social lies, and culd easily note his intentional disortions and deceptions, but this audience of 350 people was not the right crowd to question Aliyev's lullabies. After all, the majority either didn't know, or didn't care to know, about the man, issues, and justice; all they cared about was getting the Azeri and Caspian Basin fossil oil to the Western markets, period. As for moderators Richard Armitage and Zbigniew Brzezinski, they performed what their employers, the oil lobbyists, asked them to do: promote, shelter, support, and advance the cuase of Azerbaijan and President Aliyev. Former Secretary of State James Baker III, Defense Secretaries Dick Cheney and Caspar Weinberger, former Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten, and even the former White House Chief of Staff John Sununu are also on the list of those on the oil companies' payrolls. When Aliyev was asked about the bribery and corruption in his administration, he unbashedly threw the question back to the audience and asked, Don't you have bribery and corruption in your country? What can be said for, after all, he knows the reason why Brzezinski made three separate trips to Baku. One can only admire the boldness of Aliyev, the man who has dealt all his life with corrupt careerists, aparatchicks, and party functionaries, in asking his hosts, Don't you have corruption and bribery in your country (US)? When Aliyev was asked about human-rights violations in his country, he remarked, You [Americans], don't you still have problems with your civil rights? An American audience usually won't tolerate this kind of assult, but when oil is at stake, even these kinds of undiplomatic remarks can generate laughter, as was the case in this gathering. If these paid lobbyists are going to tolerate insults to the US, it isn't hard to imagine that they would not give a darn about Azeri military aggression against the Karabagh Armenians, plain and simple. GULLIBLE AUDIENCE AT GEORGETOWN At every opportunity, this Azeri dictator called Armenians the agrressors, occupiers of Azeri land, and acused them of providing a military base to Russia and maintaining a close relationship with Iran. The gullible audience, unaware of the presence of 1000 Russian technicians on Azeri soil who are still operating Gaballa (Gaballanski), the former Soviet early-warning rader station, the recent Azeri-Russian treaty of f riendship and co-operation, and the multibillion-dollar oil joint venture, assumed that Armenia is pursuing a pro-Russion policy, contrary to Azerbaijan which is conducting an anti-Russian campapgin. While he accused Armenians of expansionism and trying to create a Greater Armenia, he showed on the map that Nakhichevan was artificially separated from Azerbaijan by a swath of land, Zangezur, which was given to Armenia by Stalin. Thus, Aliyev indeed demonstrated his true intent and designs of Armenia: tolay claim to Zangezur for the eventual creation of Greater Azerbaijan. Too bad the new Armenians present did not have an opportunity to challenge his lies and deceptions. The US moved to strengthen its economic with oil-rich Azerbaijan; with cremonial honor guard and handshake, President Clinton welcomed Aliyev to the White House, where they signed joint statements aimed at improving relations between the two countries. It was amazing to see the president of the most democratic and powerful nation and signing agreements with the most dictorial and corrupt of presidents who came to power through coup d'etat. ASSESSMENT OF AMERICAN PRESS The Washington Post correspondent Peter Baker is correct in his assessment: The cordial reception for Aliyev exemplified that strategic decision by the Clinton Administraton to emphasize the economic stakes in Central Asia [and Caucasus] rather than the civil strife and human rights violations. This shows the double standard and moral bankruptcy of the foreign relations establishments, punishing and sanctioning some countries for human rights violations, yet signing multibillion-dollar contracts with dictators like Aliyev. Therefore, we Armenians should not plan our strategy in Nagorno-Karabagh on the basis of self-determination, human-rights values, and historical facts alone; rather, we should base our strategy on military strength, settlements policy, and exposing the outside negotiators' real intentions and conduct, which is to be compromise human life and values for lucrative business and personal gains. Aliyev already leaked the essentials of his country's position in the Karabagh peace negotiations, as contained in the following six principles: 1) Recognition of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan 2) Granting the highest degree of autonomy to Karabagh within Azerbaijan 3) Evacuation of Karabagh defense forces (he calls them defense forces of Armenia) from seven Azeri districts, including Kelbajar, Agdam, Hodjali, Kubatly, Zangelan, Djebrail, and Lachin 4) Opening a new line, by passing Lachin, between Armenia and Karabagh supervised by international peacekeepers 5) Resettlement of Azeri refugees in these territories, including Karabagh and 6) Return of Shushi to Azerbaijan. Aliyev calls this a compromise plan even though he doesn't like it himself. Aliyev is the kind of man who lies in broad daylight and makes youbelieve, especially if you are a recipient of his oil wealth. When he was asked about his communist past, he statyed, I personally needed several years to change my own views, and I did, but he did not elaborate. But we all remember what he said in the past; he praised the leading role of the Communist Party, and supported Marxist-Leninist ideology. It was only after the demise of the Soviet Empire that the opportunist Aliyev condemned everything about the Soviet system and Communism which he used to serve. QUESTIONS ARMENIANS COULD HAVE RAISED If the AAA and ANCA were better organized, we coul dhave had an Armenian presence felt in Georgetown's Intercultural Auditorium, asking questions and forcing Aliyev to explain. We could have asked about the charges of corruption, embezzlement of oil money, spending money for militarization, thus depriving Azeri regugees of aid and shelter, his political decision to use poor living conditions of these refugees in order to score propaganda points against Armenians for domestic, as well as foreign, consumption, by blaming the Armenians for the human misery of the Azeri population. We could have asked about his support of the principle of self- determination for the Muslim population of Kashmir, acording to his tatement in Pakistan, as well as his advocating self-determination for the Azeri-speaking minorities in Iran and Turkish minorities in Cyprus, while denying the same rights to Karabagh Armenians. We could have asked what happened to the democratically elected former Azeri President Abulfaz Elchibey, the former Prime Minister Surat Huseynov, the former Defense Minister General Ragim Gaziyev, the former State Ministers GeneralArif Jajief and Rasim Agaevm, and his implicaton of them in the pre- stating of a coup d'etat in order to round up opposition members. We could asked about the resurrection of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Turanism in Turkey and Azerbaijan, as well as his opinion about the Turkic unrest in Sinkiang uigur Province of China, and the Kurdish unrest in Turkey. We could have asked him why he blamed certain Pan-Turkist circles in Ankara for fomenting unrest in Azerbaijan and engineering a coup d'etat against his own regime. We could have asked about the Azeri servicemen who received training in the Turkish military and took part in combat operations against Karabagh Armenians. EFFECT OF ALIYEV FACTOR The Aliyev factor in the nation's capital, and the threat posed by it to the Armenian cause, unified the AAA and ANCA, and these two organizations worked together for common cause and objectives. A unified front was more effective in mobilizing public opinion, politicians and news media, and exposing the oil corporations and paid oil lobbyists, especially the unethical activities of former US government officials for financial gain. It was a learning experience for many that the power of money and might is more effective than slogans and empty rhetoric like human rights, justice, and democracy. Georgetown University never before witnessed such hypocrisy. In his article in the Houston Chronicle, Bill White very bluntly stated, The transformation of Azerbaijan from an obscure war zone to a booming US partner is a credit to two unique resources, the country's extraordinary geology and unique President [Aliyev]. He later quotes Frank Verrasato, senior vice president of the Houston-based Pennzoil Co., who stated I think this is very probably the most overt display of support from the US government that we have seen. Again, acording to Bill White, Azerbaijan could be of strategic importance to the United States and a tremendous boom to the US oil companies, because of the vast quantities of oil found in the Azeri sector of the Caspian Sea. While we Armenians are squabbling over how we should define the administrative authority of the Holy See of Etchmiadzin vis-a-vis that of the See of Cilicia, our adversaries are charting the course of history in Baku and Ankara. Aliyev's visit should remind our so-called leadership that the 21st century will be the centgury of telecommunication, information, internet, science and technology. It is about time we restructure our minds and change our prorities. Economic science, political science, earth science, social science, natural science, biotechnical science... everything that provides us knowledge keeps us away from ignorance and misunderstandings. These should be our priorities. THE BEGINNING OF ALIYEV'S DECLINE Aliyev's visit made us realize our strengths and weaknesses, as well as those of Azerbaijan. The host country, the US, also once more showed its human weakness and moral deficiencies. The power of money can make political prostitutes out of very important and powerful persons and make them serve the mighty. We all can get satisfaction from the facts on the ground that the heroic freedom fighters of Karabagh are controlling the territory of Karabagh, not the new sultans in Baku. Aliyev may have bought many powerful people in the nation's capital, but the dances of wolves are not over yet; this is the beginning of the decline of the lousy liar, who temporarily persuaded money-hungry followers to defend his cause for a big price. Azeri oil wealth, yet the biggest test has not yet begun -- the testing of the Karabagh Armenians' iron will and burning passion for freedom. The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and, most recently, The New York Times (August 4, 1997), have gradually begun to critisize former US officials, now turned oil lobbyists, for their complicity and collusion in the service of foreign interests. From illegal foreign campaign contributions, to the presidential elections (Asian-Chinese connections), to Aliyev's image building in return for oil money -- these are all fundamental weaknesses that ought to be investigated in the American political system. This country (US) is the most powerful and most democratic country in the world; a few greedy politicians and officials have no right to tarnish its image, which the world has come to respect. Armenians should thank Aliyev for exposing these corrupt people, and for uniting Armenians for Artsakh's noble cause. A wolf changes his coat but never his nature. Make yourself a sheep and wolf will eat you. Where the wolf gets one lamb it looks for another. Aliyev stated in Chicago on August 4, before his departure, that pressure on neighbouring Armenia from the US will resolve the dispute in Nagorno-Karabagh, but he returned empty-handed. President Clinton advised peaceful negotiation between the conflicting parties. Aliyev failed in his mission, and soon he will face the reality on the ground, that the people of Nagorno-Karabagh are the masters of their own destiny.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1997-08-08,0
"A New Publication on The Court Martial of the Young Turk Leaders The Spring 1997 issue of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, which just came off the press, has an extensive article on the trial of the Ittihadist leaders accused of the premeditated and organized mass murder of the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. The study is the latest work of Professor Vahakn N. Dadrian who has been exposing and highlighting the legal aspects of the Armenian genocide in several academic journals and other venues in the last decade or so. Some five years ago he published a similar but not identical study in the International Journal of Middle East Studies, in which the trials were examined within the framework of a general discussion. Still using the venue of the same renowned journal, Dadrian published another article aimed at testing the authenticity of the Talaat Pasha documents Naim Bey provided to Aram Andonian in Aleppo at the end of World War I. His principal legal analysis of the Armenian genocide from the perspectives of both national and international law was published as a monograph in the 1989 issue of Yale Journal of International Law. That legal study was republished in French in Paris and in Turkish in Istanbul in 1995. The Penal Section of the Supreme Court of Turkey in April 1997 lifted the prohibition of the distribution of this book in Turkey and stopped the legal proceedings against both the publisher and the translator of that legal study. The latest article bears the title The Turkish Military Tribunal's Prosection of the Authors of the Armenian Genocide: Four Major Court-Martial Series. It examines and analyzes in detail four specific trial proceedings involving the perpetrators of (1) Yozgat massacres, (2) Trabzon massacres and two categories of arch perpetrators; namely, (3) the Ittihadist party commissars supervising the mass killing operations in the interior of Turkey, and (4) the Ministers of the two wartime Cabinets of Turkey. For the first time, the study utilizes the Turkish press coverage of the trials and, in order to retain the character of their authenticity in important cases, the Ottoman-Turkish originals of the documents and witness testimonies are reproduced in parentheses, next to their English translations. For example, there is the testimony of Rifat Bey, a Muslim notable from Yozgat, who declared in court that at Taspunar village, Yozgat gendarmerie commander Tevfik slaughtered Armenian males between the ages of 15 and 75 with hatchets and axes as the victims kept screaming like birds; at the end of his testimony, Rifat called Tevfik a wild beast and bloodthirsty, and pleaded for the sake of God that the court take the requisite steps [of punishment]. The other principal defendant, Kemal, was described in court documents as having told his wife that he was on his way to the theater, when proceeding to Guller (Keller), the main killing field for the operations of the Yozgat massacres. He was observed smoking a water pipe amidst the moans and groans and shrieks of the people in mortal agony (Third Session, February 10, 1919). Dadrian's article also reveals that, on December 11, 1918, Trabzon's deputy in the Ottoman Parliament, Hafiz Mehmed, declared in the Chamber of Deputies that he personally saw how the Armenians, under the pretext of being taken to another port city, were loaded onto barges and thrown overboard in the high seas. What is even more significant is that Deputy Hafiz Mehmed was a lawyer by profession! In the Trabzon verdict, the Turkish Military Tribunal's panel of judges declared that the male and female infants were taken to barges and boats in batches to be drowned.

"Scholarship By Any Name Vahakn Dadrian unquestionably ranks among the pre-eminent genocide scholars in the world, and stands alone on the Armenian Genocide. He has ventured into archives infrequently examined by genocide scholars. When I use the word scholar, it is used to describe a person who attempts to find the root causes of an event as honestly as his judgment allows. There is no tolerance of propaganda or a hidden agenda - the end product is as objective as an unbiased scientific analysis allows. Dr. Dadrian personifies this definition of scholar. Acknowledgement of his scholarship by equally upright researchers has made Dr. Dadrian's findings devastating to those who would rewrite the 1915 Genocide, in fulfillment of the mandate laid out by Kemal Ataturk that there is no purpose for any endeavor save that of nationalism and in particular Turkification. Dr. Dadrian's research into the German responsibility for the murder of the Armenians by the Turks in 1915 lays open interesting possibilities. Before proceeding further, it should be clear that the factual data that follows has been researched and published by Dr. Dadrian. However, any interpretive errors of his monumental labors in this article are mine. It has become incontestable by virtue of the hard data exposed by Dr. Dadrian that the German government of World War I is guilty in a criminal, moral, and political sense for the 1915 Genocide. But, as Professor Roger Smith of the College of William and Mary, states, This in no way relieves Turkey of its responsibility... What it means is that there are degrees of guilt and, in the case of the 1915 Genocide, Germany and Turkey must share the culpability. Attempts to design percentages of guilt are an exercise in anti-intellectualism and a ploy by Turkophiles and pseudo-intellectuals to further complicate an already complicated reality. It comes down to the Turks having designed and implemented the Genocide, while Kaiser Wilhelm's government and many of his prominent officials supported, instigated, and participated. The following three of many examples presented by Dr. Dadrian in his book on the German guilt are illustrative. The German who bears the primary guilt is none other than Kaiser Wilhelm, who was the central source of authority in Imperial Germany. He directed Germany's foreign policy and its war effort. The Kaiser made it unequivocally clear, as seen in official documents in the German archives, that the German military mission in Turkey must comply with political views which His Majesty approves. His Majesty considers this as a first condition for a successful performance in Turkey. The German Emperor was presented fact upon fact as to what the Turks planned and were doing to the Armenians, but the Kaiser continued his support with the dry and criminal comment to the Turks that Armenia...should be dealt with by the Ottoman government at its discretion. DENYING MASS MURDER Dare anyone deny that this is sanction of mass murder? Who is more guilty, the one who provides funds, bullets and advisers, or the one who aims and fires the bullet? The idea of ethnic cleansing via deportations originated in the minds of the Germans and was handed to the Turks as a solution to their Armenian Question. Following the Hamidian massacres of 1894-96, General von der Goetz advanced a new doctrine of Turkish national rebirth. He stated that Turkey's future lay in the Asian part of the empire and that Turkey should give up its European dreams and consolidate Anatolia: The core of Turkey is to be found not in Europe but in Asia Minor. Turkey has greater chances of military success in Transcaucasia, where Russia is militarily weak, and its ethnic and religious ties with the local Muslim populations would come in handy. Some historians make no hesitancy about maintaining that German theorists implanted in Turkish minds the idea of ousting the Armenians from the eastern reaches of Anatolia. Field Marshall von der Goetz stated among other things in February 1914, In order to spare Turkey a new disaster, it is necessary to remove from the Russo-Turkish border areas, once and for all, the half a million Armenians who inhabit the provinces of Van, Bitlis, and Erzeroum that are contiguous to these areas. They should be transported ... in the areas of Aleppo and Mesopotamia. This is the same German planner and leader who requested that upon his death he be buried in Turkey with a Turkish flag wrapped around his body. General Fritz Bronsart von Schellendorf served as the Chief of Staff at Ottoman General Headquarters. Keep in mind that numerous German officers served on the staff of the Turkish army - they were more than advisors in the true sense. In an official document cited by Prof. Dadrian, Gen. Bronsart ordered the deportations of Armenians and demanded that severe measures be taken against the Armenians in the labor battalions to prevent them from making troubles with deportations. Severe measures is nothing less than an euphemism for murdering the Armenian men who were trained in the use of arms (even though they had been reduced to pack animal level) and who might come to the defense of their families. In other words, General Bronsart advocated the pattern established to butcher the helpless Armenians. It is important to note that this document shows very direct involvement by the highest-ranking German military. UNAWARE OF THE MASSACRES? That the civilian government officials in Germany were unaware is a ludicrous proposition. The German state archives are laden with documents that show the highest-ranking government officials in Berlin knew exactly that a genocide was taking place...yet, they continued to support the onslaught. I would hope that the Armenian National Institute (ANI) and other groups with a scholarly thrust would invite Dr. Dadrian to participate in realizing the goal of getting the facts out to every university in this nation and every government in the UN. It might be productive for ANI to make an effort to bring Prof. Dadrian on board to initiate a diplomatic approach and breakthrough with German scholars and in German universities. Professor Dadrian has certainly presented irrefutable evidence that Van Krikorian and the Armenian Assembly can use to initiate discussions with the German Embassy in Washington.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,1997-07-04,0
"Newly Published Book on Diocese of New Julfa Presented at Iranian Armenian Society The Iranian Armenian Society hosted a presentation and reception on the occasion of the publication of The Emergence of the Diocese of New Julfa in the Seventeenth Century by Vazken S. Ghougassian, which was recently published by the Scholars Press. Professor Ina Baghdiantz McCabe presented the book to the large number of attendees at the Society's center here on April 18. Professor McCabe, recently appointed to the new chair in Modern Armenian History at Tufts University, and a classmate of Dr. Ghougassian at Columbia University where they both received their degrees, spoke of the years of scholarship which went into the book and its tremendous value in an area that has not been adequately studied. The author is currently Executive Director of the Eastern Prelacy and in attendance was Archbishop Mesrob Ashjian who had just returned hours earlier from Armenia and was preparing to spent his last few weeks as Prelate of the Eastern Prelacy. His Eminence, as he often does, added a unique dimension to the evening as he shared his own experiences of his years as Prelate of the New Julfa diocese. He also had words of praise for Dr. Ghougassian who was able to complete his doctoral studies and successfully defend his dissertation while fulfilling his demanding duties at the Prelacy. This highly interesting and readable book explores the history of one of the largest, most prosperous and influential hierarchical sees of the seventeenth-century Armenian Church. As the religious institution of the largest non-Muslim minority of Iran, the diocese of New Julfa is studied here for the first time. The study is based on Armenian and Persian archival materials, as well as on other Armenian primary sources and seventeenth-century Western travelers' accounts. Include are geographic, demographic and social surveys of the diocese; a study of the civil and religious rights of the Armenians of Iran; an evaluation of the Safavid policy towards the Armenian minority; and the presentation of the birth and prosperity of the diocese, its long-lasting conflicts with the Catholic missionaries of Iran, and its cultural heritage. Twenty-two largely unpublished Armenian and Persian documents are presented in their original languages and English translation in the Appendix, as well as a complete list of seventeenth-century Armenian churches of Isfahan and New Julfa. Included in the volume are original photos and maps. The 344-page hardcover volume can be purchased at the Armenian Prelacy Bookstore, 138 E. 39th Street, New York, New York 10016. The price is $34.95. For information, contact the Bookstore at (212) 689-7810.

"The Impending Visit of Heydar Aliyev to Washington, DC The invitation extended to one of the world's greatest human rights violators by the White House is a slap in the face of the believers of democracy and human rights. The majority of Americans believe that O.J. Simpson got away with murder because of his money and wealth; human rights activists, in turn, believe that Heydar Aliyev got his invitation to the White House because of Azerbaijan's oil resources. It is official now. Azerbaijan's President Heydar Aliyev will visit Washington, DC in July or August, according to the US Embassy spokesman Richard Brown in Baku. Azeri officials are hoping that this invitation could lead to warmer relations and the eventual removal of US legislation barring US government aid to Azerbaijan until the latter lifts the blockade of Armenia. Before this invitation was issued by the White House, paid lobbyists including Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, Richard Armitage, John Maresca, Robert Byrd, Ashton Carter, and Caspar W. Weinberger prepared the groundwork at the US-Azeri Chamber of Commerce meeting on February 18, 1997, and this was followed by numerous articles by pro-Azeri propagandists in prestigious US newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Times, The Washington Post, The Baltimore Sun, and The Boston Globe. Obviously, giant oil corporations with their enormous power and financial resources were able to orchestrate this anti-Armenian campaign to soften anti-Aliyev sentiment prevailing in human rights activist circles. In image-building efforts, Heydar Aliyev was presented as being pro-Western, anti-Russian, and the champion of market-oriented economy and democracy. What a joke! Any well-informed person who knows the past history and background of Aliyev cannot help but shake his head in anger and contempt, and display his anguish as to how money and wealth can buy justice and conceal the criminal record of someone like Aliyev. What is all this fuss about the human rights violations in Iran, Libya, Syria, North Korea, Cuba, and Sudan? The leaderships in these countries are no more violators of human rights than Aliyev, so why is Aliyev treated differently? The answer is simple; besides his country's oil wealth, he is propped up to be the guardian of Western interests, bulwark against Russian expansionism, and Iranian fundamentalism (Cold War II). He has been given the assignment to lead, and prepare the soil, to spread pan-Turkism. He will probably be wined and dined in Washington, DC, make an appearance at the prestigious National Press Club, meet the editors of major newspapers and have ample opportunities to spread anti-Armenian venom and propaganda. Naturally, anti-Armenian forces will take full advantage to influence public opinion, as well as the disposition of Senators and Congressmen in Armenian-Azeri related issues. WELCOME FROM FINANCIAL CIRCLES Most likely, Wall Street, financial circles, and big corporations will all welcome Aliyev as an important statesman and a strategic financial partner. Pro-Azeri circles will portray budding US-Azeri relations as essential for US national interests and security. Let us review the profile and public life of our visitor, previously called Gaydar to appear Russian, now Heydar to appear Muslim in order to adapt to the changing times. Ali Rizaoglu (Aliyevich) Aliyev was born on May 10, 1923, in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic (former Armenian territory). His education was interrupted by WWII, during which he was a member of the military counterintelligence group SMERSH on the Ukrainian front. He joined the Communist Party and the KGB in 1945 and then worked in the KGB's Eastern Division, traveling to Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkey. He attended the evening division of the history faculty of Azerbaijan State University and graduated in 1957. During the 1960s he advanced to the rank of Major General in the KGB, and became the energetic and controversial KGB Chairman of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, following the recommendation of Semyon Tsvigun, the former KGB boss and Leonid Brezhnev's brother-in-law. He became first the secretary of the Azerbaijan Communist party at the July 1969 plenum and held that post until this promotion to the First Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers. Gaidar Aliyevich Aliyev (now Heydar Ali Rizaoglu Aliyev) become a candidate member of the CPSU Politburo in 1976. After Brezhnev's death, the new boss Yuri Andropov brought Aliyev to Moscow and made him a full member of the Soviet Politburo ad First Deputy Chairman. A protege of Brezhnev, Aliyev now became an Andropov loyalist. He presented himself as a loyal Communist and, in his speeches, quoted Vladimir I. Lenin and Leonid I. Brezhnev. He praised the moral leadership of the Communist Party and was an advocate of the Marxist-Leninist ideology. EXTENSIVE PURGE OF PARTY Aliyev began his tenure with an extensive purge of the party and state apparatus and created a personality cult, ushering in a period of Mafia or clan domination. He promoted atheistic education, political trials for opponents, and arbitrary arrest of dissidents. In addition, oppression and persecution of the Armenians, Lezgis, Avars, Kurds, Talish, and other ethnic minorities continued in full swing. His hands became stained with the blood of thousands of innocent people. Human rights violations were a daily occurrence during his rule. During the period of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost, Aliyev fell from grace, lost his job, and disappeared from public view. After the demise of the USSR, he left Moscow and returned to his native Nakhichevan to wait for the proper moment to claim power in Baku. His political instincts proved him to be correct. The incompetent and charlatan former President of Azerbaijan Ebulfez Elchibey was overthrown by Surat Huseyinov and Aliyev triumphantly returned to Baku and took power. AUTHORITARIAN RULE BEGINS Aliyev's authoritarian rule began and showed no signs of weakening. With false charges of masterminding the March 1995 coup attempt, reminiscent o the Soviet Communist era, Aliyev arrested the former Prime Minister Surat Huseyinov, Former Minister of Defense General Ragim Gaziyev, former Foreign Minister Tefik Gasimov, former State Minister and numerous former high-ranking officials. To undermine the power of the opposition parties over the constituency, he ordered the Minister of Justice to reject their registration, the media was silenced, and numerous opposition papers were closed. In order to conceal his political, economic, and social crimes, suppression of ethnic minorities, and arbitrary arrest of intelligentsia, he kept his country's media, including the State Radio and Television, under strict censure. Political trials of former senior government officials continued, the state of emergency decree banned all peaceful rallies and political demonstrations. Most political parties were outlawed; non-Baku residents, especially refugees, were expelled from the capital to prevent discontent. Illegal searches of opposition parties, harassment as well as beatings of dissidents, and arbitrary jailing of the regime's opponents continue. Free speech is non-existent; repression and human rights violations are rampant. The whole country has turned in to a jail house. This is the background of the man whom Americans are going to honor in the nation's capital and the White House. Naturally President Clinton will claim in public that he will ask Aliyev to improve human rights in Azerbaijan, to give assurance that Azerbaijan will respect self-rule for Karabagh within Azerbaijan, and will encourage peaceful negotiations between Azeris and Armenians. To make this possible, he will ask Congress to repeal Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act; in private, however, most of the talks will involve Caspian oil production and delivery, including the final decision on proposed oil pipeline routes. Aliyev, a seasoned politician, will try to use the oil card to convince President Clinton that it is in the national interest of the US to side with Azerbaijan, since he knows well through his communist education that what is good for multinational corporations and oil giants is good for America as well. NO GAINS FOR ARMENIANS Nothing good can be expected for Armenians from this visit. However, both Aliyev and Clinton should be made aware of certain realities on the ground. The proposed construction of the oil pipelines will never take place as long as the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabagh, Abkhazia, Ossetia, and the Kurdish region of Turkey continue. The pacification of Chechnya following the recent Chechen-Russian agreement has made oil transportation through the Russian port of Novorossisk a possibility. Russia will try to create more regional conflicts not to divert Azeri-Caspian oil through Georgia, and certainly the continuation of the Karabagh conflict will rule out any oil pipeline construction through Turkish territory - favored routes for Aliyev. If the Clinton administration is taken by Aliyev's charm and persuasion skills, this exerts unnecessary pressure on Armenian President Levon Der Bedrosian. This will be counterproductive, forcing Armenian and Karabagh into Russia's arms; Armenia and Karabagh will be forced to join the Russia-Belarus union. The people of Nagorno-Karabagh will not give even one inch to any bargaining on their backs. This will not bring peace; on the contrary, it will lead to war. The dilemma will be for the oil giants and corporations; while they want oil, they cannot get it if there is a war in the region. The dilemma for Aliyev is that he wants everything, including Karabagh, the billions and billions of dollars in royalties from oil business, and punishment of Armenians, Russians, and Iranians for challenging his power. The dilemma for the US, the most democratic country in the world, will be to host a man who is a dictator with a very bad record, but one who controls a country rich in fossil oil. It should be borne in mind that he has many foreign and domestic enemies and, considering that he is 74 years old, the question arises as to who will succeed him. CALL TO ACTION It is an urgent matter for Armenians to set aside their differences and petty arguments and to form at once a Karabagh Liberation Committee with the participation of all patriotic Armenians and organizations. Financial and human resources need to be mobilized to prevent dictator Aliyev's visit to Washington, DC, or at least to make his visit most unwanted. We cannot have double standards: While barring state visits by Fidel Castro, Saddam Hussein, Muammer Quadaffi as outlaws, we cannot give the red carpet treatment to this man whose criminal record, human rights violations, and terrorism against his own people put him in the same class as the aforementioned international outlaws whom the US is trying to isolate. The proposed Karabagh Liberation Committee should initiate action without delay, to mobilize all human rights groups, groups for democracy, members of Congress and many other influential individuals and the press. People of honesty have an obligation to expose Heydar Aliyev's background, political crimes, human rights violations, and terrorism against his own people, and urgently ask our President to cancel his visit, and ask for an investigation to find out who was behind the invitation to bring this man to the US, since his record, credentials, and past conduct make him an equal with other international outlaws.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1997-05-31,0
"Camelia Sadat and Kim Tomsen Will Address AIWA International Conference in Paris The effect of tradition and change on the lives of women will be examined by journalist, author, and lecturer Camelia Sadat, who will be the keynote speaker at the Conference sponsored by the Armenian International Women's Association in Paris on July 20-23. Daughter of the late Egyptian president and Nobel Peace Prize-winner Anwar Sadat, Camelia Sadat now teaches and lectures throughout the United States and abroad about contemporary issues. She has just returned from a successful lecture tour in Japan, and will address the Women's Federation for World Peace in Istanbul this month and the Vienna Summit of Mothers for World Peace in June. In her memoir, My Father and I, published by Macmillan, she provides an absorbing and exceptionally candid account of her loving, but sometimes turbulent, relationship with her father. Camelia was one of Sadat's three daughters by his first wife, Ekbal Madi, a woman from his native village. A deeply tradition Muslim who nonetheless brought revolutionary change to Egypt, Sadat arranged Camelia's marriage to a man 17 years her senior when she was only 12 years old. Yet he later supported his daughter's desire for independence and education, which eventually brought her to the United States. Bearing a striking physical resemblance to Anwar Sadat, Camelia Sadat has dedicated her life to furthering the ideals and goals of her late father. WOMEN'S RESPONSE TO CRISES As a featured luncheon speaker, Kim Nguyen Tomsen will compare and contrast the response of women to crisis in Armenia and in the former Yugoslavia. Wife of the US Ambassador to Armenia Peter Tomsen, she is the Chief Administrative Officer of the Agency for International Development's Office of Foreign Diaster Assistance in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mrs. Tomsen has energetically and successfully pursued a career mixing family responsibilities, government service and business activity. Born in Vietnam, she attended a French high school before traveling to the United States as an American Field Service exchange student at Ashland High School in Oregon. She subsequently graduated from Hiram College in Ohio with a degree in Political Science and Art History. After marrying Peter Tomsen in 1969, Mrs. Tomsen lived and worked in New Delhi, Moscow, Taipei, Beijing, Zagreb and Sarajevo, as well as Washington. Prior to her current assignment, she served as a US Visa Officer, librarian and an assistant to the Foreign Commercial Service. Her strong interest in the business community derived from her past experience as a Sales Manager for Pan American Airways and Director for Financial Development for a hotel marketing company. In Armenia she has been active in a wide range of activities in the diplomatic and Armenian community. She and Ambassador Tomsen have two daughters. EXAMINING DIVERSE ROLES Scholars, professionals, and community activists from all arts of the world will attend AIWA's second international conference in Paris, which is designed to build on the foundation established at the organization's 1994 ground-breaking first conference in London. Participants will examine the diverse roles of Armenian women in the past, affirm the evolving contributions of Armenian women in the present, and chart a course for the future. The Conference, to take place at the Hotel Concorde La Fayette, will open with a welcoming dinner reception on Sunday evening, July 20. Three days of conference sessions and panels will follow, from Monday, July 21 through Wednesday, July 23. A closing evening celebration concert prepared by pianist Sahan Arzruni and featuring works by Armenian women composers will end the conference on July 23. Karen Bogosian, of Rockport, Mass., heads the Paris Conference Committee, which is working with the California Conference Committee co-chaired by Lily Ring Balian and Cindy Norian. Joy Renjilian-Burgy is AIWA president, and Laurel Karabian heads the California Chapter. Further information about AIWA or about the Paris Conference is available by contacting the organization at P.O. Box 654, Belmont, MA 02178; telephone/fax: (617) 926-0171.

"Ataturk's Revolution And Its Lessons for Armenians Every century is marked by at least one important historical event involving an important leader, scientist, or political figure, which brings about changes affecting the life of a nation, or group of nations. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was one such historical figure who left a great impact on Turkey's destiny, as well as the destiny of neighboring states. His talents and leadership qualities played a major role in salvaging the Turkish nation from the ruins of the collapsing Ottoman Empire, and the fire and ashes of W.W.I. The Sick Man of Europe, the Ottoman Empire, lost the war, along with its ally Germany; moreover, a humiliating peace treaty was forced upon them by the victorious Allied powers, and the Ottoman Empire's territory was then occupied by Britain, France, Greece, and Italy, Armenia and Kurdistan were supposed to the new independent states in Eastern Anatolia, according to the Treaty of Sevres. Mustafa Kemal rejected foreign intervention and dictates, as well as US mandates. He was able to unify nationalist forces under his command, and created a new national assembly in Ankara. Furthermore, in direct defiance of the central authorities in Istanbul, the Sultan's regime, he was able to create a national army. In the end he was able to muster enough support from the populace to present the nationalist government in Ankara as a spokesman in dealing with foreign governments, thus making the Sultan's government in Istanbul irrelevant. With his newly formed military forces, and political clout, he issued orders to invade the first Republic of Armenia; following his success, he turned his might against the Greek forces. His victory was sweet and complete; the entire Anatolia was cleaned of unwanted so-called foreign elements (Greeks and Armenians). ATATURK'S GREATNESS Ataturk's greatness lay in more than just his leadership qualities, his organizational skills, political maturity, and instincts; he was a great reformer and visionary. He realized that in order to give his nation pride and an identity, he had to free it from the shackles of religious mysticism, fanaticism, and dogmatism. He gave his nation a new identity with the slogan ne mutluyum Turkum diyene, which translates as How fortunate it is to be called Turk. This slogan gave the former Ottoman Muslim subjects a new consciousness, a new awareness; from now on, they would be called Turk first, Muslim second, whereas during the Ottoman period, they used to call themselves Muslim first, Ottoman second, and Turk only if they were pressed to identify their ethnic background. Ataturk realized that religion alone was not sufficient to give an identity to the new man in Anatolia; he felt strongly that this new nation, the modern Republic of Turkey and its citizens should call themselves Turk. Indeed, for the first time in 600 years, the people of this land began to call themselves Turks; even minorities like Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Kurds, Turkmens, Hamsins, Laz, Circassians, and Georgians were all instructed to call themselves Turks. Although Turk means a citizen of Turkey, in generic terms the Turkish identity was synonymous with Tirkification, and was meant for assimilative purposes. Thus, ethnic Kurds were presented as mountain Turks, while Armenians, Greeks, and Assyrians were referred to as Christian Turks. This kind of secularism, in fact nationalism, permanently separated the Turkish identity from its former religious-Islamic one, and changed the Turkish society drastically, injecting into it new energy and providing it new stamina. The mostly stagnant and backward Islamic masses were replaced by dynamic, mostly nationalistic forces, pursuing Kemalist principles and doctrines (Kemalism). ISLAM THREAT TO TURKISH IDENTITY Today the Turkish military, loyal followers of Kemalism, are seeing the danger of Islamic Fundamentalism; it threatens to replace the Turkish identity with an Islamic one, which may convert the Turkish society from its national character to one with a universal Islamic character. According to Prime Minister Necmeddin Erbakan, the Kurdish issue will become irrelevant, once the law of Islam (Sheriat) becomes the supreme law of the land, superseding the Kemalist Constitution, Turkism will be replaced by Islamism, and this is why the Turkish generals are not happy, nor are their foreign supporters. There are parallels between the Turkish and Armenian experiences. We should follow the Turkish example very closely. For almost seventeen centuries we have practiced Christianity very fervently, to the degree that we equated our national identity with the Church. In fact, during periods of loss of independence, the Church acted as a quasi-government, for the church hierarchy was satisfied with its new role and privileges. With the loss of its independence, our nation lost its national character; instead of having a state, we were satisfied with the Church offering us a good life in heaven, while on earth we were losing our identity, freedom and independence. Except in a few instances, the Church did not promote human, social and/or political rights, and did not guide us to national salvation and independence. They taught us to love our enemy, and to turn the other cheek, when we were subjected to harassment and humiliation. ARMENIAN CHURCH LEGACY Armenians were indoctrinated with spiritual values, belief in a heavenly life, and the histories contained in the Old and New Testaments; meanwhile, the poor Armenian souls were living in shackles of arbitrary tyrannical rule. Enslaved by the new rulers of our land, we lost our fighting spirit and national identity. Pacifistic clergymen, satisfied with their worldly privileges and living standards, adapted in order to coexist with the ruling authorities, thus making the status quo a fact of reality, rather than making it unnatural for the Armenian masses. Thus, we became the loyal subjects of one or another empire (milletti sadika, under the Ottomans). The struggle for liberation and independence was spearheaded by nationalistic forces and intelligentsia, when they had enough of the Church's impotence. What good came out of being blind followers of Christianity, when the liberty and the happiness were promised in heaven only, while on earth our nation was losing its Armenian character? The public even began studying the Bible written in Turkish, because they had already forgotten their mother tongue. By studying our history, one cannot help but realize that the most persecution to our nation came from other Christian states. The Byzantine emperors were so busy harassing the Armenian state that we did not have enough strength to defend our land against the invading Seljuk-Turk hordes from Central Asia in the 10th century. Christian Rome ignored Cilician Armenian appeals for assistance in the face of the Mamluks who invaded during the 12th-14th century; instead of providing military assistance, Rome tried to convert Armenian Christians to Catholicism. During the fateful years of 1915-1920, while our nation was subject to extermination, and our Armenian lands were robbed in broad daylight, the Christian world did nothing to rescue their Christian brothers and sisters in Armenia. The irony of history is that the Muslim Arabs gave us food and shelter, and they let the remnants of the Armenians have a new life in the Arab lands. SAME SITUATION TODAY Today the situation is no different: The entire Christian-Western world is defending the Azeris against the heroic people of Karabagh, in order to have a access to oil resources, to make a profit therefrom, and to gain geopolitical advantage. Again, the Muslim Iranians are extending aid to Armenia and Karabagh. Ataturk's vision, and greatness to a certain extent, proves that religion fails to give an identity to nation; rather, a nation's identity is derived from common culture, history, heritage, tradition and language. There are Muslim and Christian Albanians, Muslim and Christian Georgians, Muslim and Christian Arabs, Afro-Americans, Filipinos, Buddhist and Christian Koreans, Chinese etc. However, universal religions do not determine their nationality; rather, the country that they belong to determines their national identity. This was not the case for Armenians until recently. We did not have an independent country, with the opportunity to be citizens of our own nation. Now that we do have the opportunity to be called Armenian again, we have to find our new identity through belonging to the Armenian nation and being citizens of an independent state. In fact, the Muslim Kurds and Yezidis of the Republic of Armenia are as much Armenian as Christian Armenians by definition. SETTING PRIORITIES STRAIGHT It is about time we set our priorities straight. As a nation, we have to learn to deal with certain realities. We are Armenians first; being Christian Apostolic, Catholic, Presbyterian, or Muslim is the choice of the citizens of Armenia, through their family traditions and faith. Many people will object to this argument, and I sympathize with them, but every modern, democratic, secular state, like the United States, meets these requirements. We have to direct our efforts toward strengthening Armenia's and NKR's economic, military, scientific, industrial and educational potential, to improve their health care, social justice, transportation, telecommunication systems, to promote the cause of NKR and Armenia throughout the world, to pursue the recognition of the Genocide and the issue of occupied Armenian lands. In order to provide these services, and to promote the Armenian cause, we should build Armenian community centers, accessible for all Armenians, believers from different denominations or nonbelievers, members of all political parties, organizations, laymen, intellectuals, rich and poor alike. In this forum we could teach our youth Armenian culture, heritage, tradition, language, literature, art and folklore, political and social activism, and make them realize their identity of being Armenian and belonging to the Armenian nation. ROLE OF ARMENIAN COMMUNITY CENTERS Let the clergy, in turn, preach Christianity, give spiritual nurture, and teach morals, codes of ethics, and family values, provided that they practice what they preach (scandals, such as those having rocked the Jerusalem Patriarchate, politicization of the Church, as in Antelias, deplorable unprofessional acts by some individual priests and bishops should not be tolerated). On the other hand, the Armenian community centers should undertake the task of uniting people in a social context, and promote the issues already mentioned above. Since the Church so far has caused more disunity, let cultural centers serve to effect unity by promoting the Armenian cause, heritage, culture and values. The money spent on these community centers will serve this purpose well. We are now in a new era, during which the new generations of Armenians will take over the leadership, with pride and a sense of belonging to an independent nation, where the priorities will be radically different than those of their predecessors. The new generations of Armenians are more educated, financially secure, and sophisticated, and they will not have the burden of their predecessors' personal hatreds, grudges, and misunderstandings, unless we teach them such, which will be a great disservice. Let the new computer and Internet generation find out the truth for themselves, and chart the course of history for the 21st century. Our parents' generation lived through the wars, massacres, poverty, deprivation, and discrimination; our transitional generation witnessed division, abuse of power, wickedness, and treachery, only finally to experience a new hope and witness victory. The new generation actually will deliver the promise to the nation that we were all yearning for, for a long time, but for them to succeed in this endeavor, we should provide the right environment and tools, not each them to hate and be divisive. SOLUTIONS AT HAND We all have responsibilities. Instead of waiting for others to solve our problems, we should find solutions ourselves. We have enough daily information at our disposal today to assess the politics, economics, and social conditions of today's world. The international information highways called the Internet and World Wide Web keep us informed around the clock. We know all too well about the games the global powers are playing in the Transcaucasus, and in the Middle East, with Armenia and NKR being situated center stage. We can deal with our adversaries, and our so-called mercurial friends, who are trying to undermine NKR's and Armenia's security for their geopolitical, economic, and military interests; if we have the necessary information, and sophistication, we can win. The moment that the armed forces of NKR and Armenia are in a position to project their power, to control the oil pipeline transportation routes, we will be negotiating partners to cut deals with oil interest groups, as opposed to the Azeris, Georgians, or Turks. Might makes right - this the reality in today's world too. Again, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's ingenuity came from his vision, self-reliance, determination, sophistication, philosophy, and leadership qualities, and his ability to deal with foreign governments from a position of strength and confidence. He gave his nation pride, confidence, and ideals. Some may disagree because of their personal dislike of the man, but it is more helpful to be realistic and accept the realities as they are, rather than be emotional and unrealistic. According to the great Armenian philosopher and intellectual Mkhitar Gosh, Those who do not see their own great evil but judge the lesser evils of others with the Lord's wrath, are most arrogant and stupid. Armenians can now be sure that in NKR and Armenia there are groups of leaders and military cadres that have the vision, dedication, and will power to make NKR and Armenia a strong and modern nation. The question in the Diaspora is, do we have the will, vision, and determination to accelerate the process of building a democratic, secular, prosperous, progressive, and modern Armenia, and NKR, to deal with global realities, and not imaginary celestial world issues, which are beyond our control. The challenge is there, the choice is (y)ours.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,1997-05-10,0
"CAPTAIN MOONLIGHT: Saturday Night in Ballymena By BRIAN ROHAN Ballymena, Northern Ireland - AT the Ballymena train station, the white-haired woman behind the-counter at the sweet shop is asked for directions to Harryville. Asper the custom of white-haired sweet shop women all over Ireland, sheanswers with a question. What would bring you there? Our Lady's Church. Evening mass. It is getting late on a Saturday, and the last of the commuters have already left the shop after picking up an evening paper or a packet of crisps. Ballymena is a hilly, quiet city in Antrim, the heart of Northern Ireland's mostly-Protestant `Bible Belt.' It is a city previously best-known as the birthplace of the actor Liam Neeson. In recent months, it has gained additional fame: the home of some of the ugliest religious battles in years, outside Our Lady's Roman Catholic Church, in the section known as Harryville. After some hesitation, the directions are given. Past the fire station and over the bridge, and just keep on walking on the road to your right, says the woman. Just keep walking and you'll see it. And, she warns, Don't go asking no one else. On the walk out from the city center, the Larne Road drops into Harryville. The crucifix of a church spire can be seen above the pale chimney-smoke of evening fires. In the distance, the religious denomination of the home team is revealed by the ornate reds, yellows, greens and blues of stained-glass windows. But these colored windows are different than those in most Catholic churches -- their colors are muted grey by heavy layers. F--k the Pope, reads the graffiti on a wall across the street from Our Lady's. Over the tall iron gate and above the front entrance of the church is the daring work of another graffiti artist, one who preferred shorthand -- F.T.P. Underneath the Union Jacks which have been defiantly hung from lamp-posts, knots of crewcut teenagers are already getting lagered-up for the evening's fun. There's only one Man United, one f--ing Man United, shout one group with soccer on their minds, drinking tall cans of beer and flagons of alcoholic apple cider. The curbstones outside Our Lady's have been painted the unionist red, white and blue, and scrawled everywhere are the acronyms of the loyalist alphabet soup: UVF, UDA, LPA, etc. Inside Our Lady's, Fr. Frank Mullen raises his hands in a gesture of powerlessness. I suppose you could say we're under siege here, aye, says the priest, preparing for the Saturday evening mass. It has been like this since at least last December, when local members of the fraternal Orange Order decided to picket Our Lady's Saturday evening mass. The stated reason for the pickets was revenge for last summer in Dunloy, a nearby Catholic town where residents decided to stop allowing the annual onslaught of Orange Order parades. In February, a spokesman for the Harryville Residents Association explained the picket to the Irish Times: It's like this -- when the Roman Catholics in Dunloy let the loyalists march, then the loyalists in Harryville will let the Roman Catholics in Harryville go to Mass in peace, said the spokesman. It is a familiar issue in Northern Ireland, where almost all residential areas have long been divided by religion. In the summer marching season, the orange sashes and booming lambeg drums line out in a countless array of parades. Inevitably, and many say intentionally, these parades wind noisily out of the Protestant areas and into Catholic, nationalist ones. The interesting twist evidenced by Harryville has been the revenge extracted by one community on another, miles away. The Orange Hall in Catholic-dominated Dunloy and Our Lady's Church in Protestant-dominatedHarryville are alike in that both are religious outposts in `enemy' territory. Catholics argue that there is a crucial difference in that they merely attend mass in Harryville whereas the Orange Order shuts down Dunloy's main streets with a defiant parade at least 12 times each summer. In Harryville, the distinction is not appreciated by most, including the area's representative at the Northern Ireland Forum, Mr. Ian Paisley Jnr. There are people who have a legitimate gripe because they're now being denied their traditional place of worship at Harryville, said Paisley. Let's resolve this by Protestants going to their place ofworship in their traditional way at Dunloy, and vice-versa, the Catholics get to their place of worship at Harryville. At the height of the Harryville standoff this past winter, an estimated 600 protesters tumed up outside Our Lady's, jeering the regular Saturday mass crowd of 300 parishioners. Firecrackers, bricks and bottles were hurled as Mass-goers scurried from cars to the church front door. One woman was pulled from her car, which was then wrecked by the mob. The largest protest occurred on the second Saturday in February, when 22 Orange Order bands drowned out hymns and prayers by playing marching songs on the streets outside. If this was happening on the British mainland outside a Jewish synagogue or a Muslim mosque there would be national outrage, said Fr. Mullen. He and the other Our Lady's priests have been forced to live away from the rectory at Our Lady's, which was attacked by local loyalists last July. Fr. Mullen's car was petrolbombed, and he had to be rescued from the house after concrete blocks were thrown through the windows. Last Saturday evening, dozens of Royal Ulster Constabulary officers were on the street outside Our Lady's, with a considerable British Army backup. The mass-goers, almost all of whom were dropped off by car, shuffled quietly and silently past small bands of disorganized local youths who laughed and shouted half-hearted abuse. Ya f--ing Fenian lovers, shouted one youth at the RUC officers. Why don't ye go in and say the f--ing Rosary with `em. Inside the door of Our Lady's, parishioners said they were relieved to see the crowds gradually diminish over the past few weeks, down to the present state of somewhat acceptable verbal abuse. We knew they couldn't keep it up like they had been doing, said one fiftyish man wearing a vest and tie and holding a brown tweed cap. They saw that the Catholics would not back down, that we wouldn't stop going to mass here. They couldn't stop us from praying, said the man's wife. Those that have stayed have had their prayers answered. Perhaps. But also noted as a possible reason for the diminishing protests have been the official condemnations of some unionist leaders. Recently, the Orange Order's Grand Master, Robert Saulters, stood outside Our Lady's with several colleagues, holding a banner which read: Orangemen support Civil and Religious Liberty for All. The gesture was derided by a local nationalist group as a cynical stunt staged to counter Saulters' comment in January that British Labor Party leader Tony Blair was a traitor for marrying a Catholic. Other possible reasons for the diminishing protests were the winter's cold and the vigilance of the RUC. But with summer in the air and the marching season too--and with the word from Dunloy that Catholics will once again demand the rerouting of this summer's Orange marches -- the parishioners of Our Lady's are fearful that things will heat up again. They've gone quiet for now, but it's not because they've suddenly fallen in love with us, let's face it, said a parishioner, at the end of mass.","Rohan, Brian",Irish Voice,1997-04-29,0
"The newly inaugurated Media Center at Haigazian University was packed on Thursday, May 16, 2002, with an audience attending an event dedicated to the Armenian-speaking, Muslim community of the Hemshin in northeastern Turkey. The event began with the presentation of Momi (Grandmother), a 22-minute feature film in Homshetsma, the language of the Hemshin, depicting the lifestyle of the Hopa Hemshin in their summer pastures. Directed by Ozcan Alper, Momi (2000) is believed to be one of the very rare films, if not the only one to date, made in Homshetsma. The film presentation was followed by a lecture by Hovann Simonian of Encino, CA, who is currently a Ph.D. candidate researching theories of secession in the Department of Political Science at the University of Southern California. Simonian was born in Beirut and spent his early years in Lebanon and later in Switzerland. He holds as MA in International Relations from the Department of Political Science at the University of Southern California (1996) and another MA in Central Asian Studies from the Center for Near and Middle Eastern Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, the University of London (1997). He is the co-author, with Prof. R. Hrair Dekmejian, of Troubled Waters: The Geopolitics of the Caspian Region (London: I.B. Tauris and New York: St. Martin/Palgrave, 2001) and the editor of the forthcoming The Hemshin, which will be published by Curzon Press in London as part of its Peoples of the Caucasus Series. Simonian described the Hemshin as one of the numerous, distinct, small communal groups which have survived in the Caucasus and Pontus regions due to the protection and isolation provided by the formidable mountains in the area. The Hemshin have preserved, centuries after their conversion to Islam, a sense of identity distinct from their neighbors. The Hemshin, explained Simonian, are now divided into two communities, living separately in the modern Turkish provinces of Rize and Artvin. These two communities, however, are almost oblivious of one another's existence. Moreover, both of them are also unaware of the existence of a yet third related community, speaking a close, if not identical dialect, the Christian Hamshen Armenians of Abkhazia and Krasnodar (Russia). Simonian said that among the western group of Bash-Hemshin, who live in the Hemshin and Djamlihemshin districts of the Rize province, the Armenian language had disappeared sometime in mid-nineteenth century. It was replaced by a local Turkish dialect, which includes a large number of Armenian loan words. The Armenian language continues to survive to this day, however, among the eastern group of the Hopa-Hemshin, who live in the Hopa and Borchka districts of the Artvin province. Given the growing decline of the use of the Armenian language in the Diaspora, the ironic possibility that these Muslims villagers may well be the last speakers of Western Armenian must not be excluded, added the speaker. According to Simonian, the Bash-Hemshin number between 15,000 and 23,000 in the Rize province, while the Hope Hemshin are estimated at around 25,000. There are also a dozen or so villages in Bolu and Sakarya, which were settled by the Hemshin at the end of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, large numbers of Hemshin can be found in cities like Trabzon, Erzerum, Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. Some of these city-dwellers return to their home villages and pastures in the summer months. A total figure of 100,000 Hemshins living in the whole of Turkey appears to be a realistic estimate, Simonian concluded. Referring to the early history of this group, Simonian stated that Armenians had immigrated to the Black Sea coast region in 791 to escape the oppressive fiscal policy of the Arab Caliphate. The Byzantine emperor, Constantine VI, settled them, and one of their leaders, Prince Hamam Amatuni, established the town of Hamamshen, the exact location of which has not been discovered to date. Simonian explained that the name Hamamshen gradually turned into Hamshen and, eventually, to the present-day Hemshin. Simonian indicated that almost nothing is known about Hamshen in the following six centuries (9th-15th c.). The extraordinary isolation of the region protected the principality of Hamshen from invasions, and it probably survived as a vassal of, first, the Byzantine Empire, then, its successor, the Empire of Trebizond (Trabzon), and, finally, the Turkish tribal confederation of the Akkoyunlus. This Armenian principality fell under Ottoman control in the late 1480s. Most historians, reported Simonian, believe that conversion into Islam among the Armenians of Hamshen began in the 1640s. Islamization simultaneously affected other non-Muslim groups in the region and was probably motivated by an Ottoman desire to control this strategically important area, which was close to Christian Georgia and, then, Russia. The unbearable tax burden imposed on non-Muslim subjects and coercive tactics exercised by mullahs in the region are usually given as reasons behind this conversion. Another bout of Islamization occurred in the early eighteenth century, this time among the Hemshin living in the region of Karadere (Sev-Ked). In the meantime, a large number of Christians in the area, who refused Islamization, drifted westwards towards Trabzon, Ordu, Charshamba, Giresun and even as far as Izmit. The new converts to Islam were called, for a long time, ges-ges or crypto-Christians. Some of them made a failed attempt to return to Christianity during the Tanzimat period in the third quarter of the nineteenth century. Even some of the small number of Turkish-speaking Muslim migrants who moved to the region inhabited by the newly Islamized Hemshin became Hemshinized themselves. From the 1860s onwards, many Christian Hamshen Armenians moved to the Black Sea shores of the Russian Empire, added Simonian. They are the ancestors of most Armenians in Abkhazia and Krasnodar who lived there before the breakup of the Soviet Union. Simonian stressed, however, that most Hemshin today claim that they are of pure Turkish stock. They totally reject having Armenian bloodlines and only accept having cultural links with Armenians (including the use of Armenian by the Hopa Hemshin), due to long coexistence with the latter. This interpretation is supported by the Kemalist ideologues of modern Turkey. After the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78, 12 Hemshin villages near the Black Sea Coast found themselves within the newly acquired Russian territories. Despite at least one public suggestion made by the famous editor, Grigor Artsruni, the Armenian Church made no attempt to return the Hemshin villagers to its fold. Simonian continued by saying that six of these villages were returned to Turkey in 1921; the rest became part of the Adjar autonomous republic within Soviet Georgia. In 1944, the Soviet leader, Joseph Stalin, deported the Hemshin (and the Meskhetian Turks) in Transcaucasia to Central Asia. The Hemshin exiles established contacts with intellectuals in Armenia in the 1980s, but political and economic upheavals in Armenia starting in 1988 put an end to discussions to bring them to the republic. Most Hemshin returnees from Central Asia settled, therefore, in the region of Krasnodar in 1989. As a consequence of recent rising ethnic tensions in the Krasnodar region, it appears that the Hemshin like to distance themselves from the Meskhetians; they have appealed to the Armenian community in Krasnodar, expressing readiness to be registered as Armenians and take up Armenian surnames, provided they can keep their Muslim faith. Simonian's lecture was enriched by a series of slides that he showed. He had taken these pictures of the landscape and people in Hemshin-populated regions in Turkey during his research trip to the area. In the question-and-answer period that followed the lecture, Simonian elaborated that the Hemshin are not very religious. They have very few mosques and very few people attend them. They also consume a lot of alcohol. They are educated in Turkish. The annually celebrate traditional Armenian feasts like Vartevar (transfiguration) and Verapokhum (Assumption), without actually being aware of the original meanings of these feasts Simonian also pointed out that, since the nineteenth century, the Western Hemshin have emphasized the importance of education. The date, many Bash Hemshin travel to Istanbul and other Turkish cities to further their studies. Most of these students do not return to their villages, however.

"World-renowned dissident intellectual Noam Chomsky, speaking at an Armenian community forum, analyzed and condemned repressive Turkish, Israeli, and US policies in West-Central Asia, likening them to the thuggish tactics of gangsters using fore to maintain control. Professor Chomsky made his comments during a public forum organized by the Armenian National Committee (ANC) of Eastern Massachusetts. Titled US Policy in West-Central Asia, Freedom of Speech, and the Kurds in Turkey, the event was held on June 7 at the Armenian Cultural and Educational Center in Watertown, and was attended by some 200 Armenian and non-Armenian supporters and activists. Introduction Prof. Chomsky was introduced by Armenian Weekly editor Jason Sohigian, on behalf of the ANC of Eastern Massachusetts. Taking the opportunity to address a mostly non-Armenian audience, Sohigian provided historical background on the host organization, the ANC, as well as the ARF. The Axis of Evil Prof. Chomsky began his talk with an overview of the region and the role of the US there. He discussed the axis of evil recently described by President Bush as including Iraq, Iran, and North Korea. He noted that the term was inappropriate because these countries cannot possibly be considered an axis, in that two of them were recently at war with each other and have nothing to do with the third. He therefore explored why these countries were selected as leading enemies. Chomsky said North Korea was chosen because it is not Muslim, so that current actions by the US wouldn't be portrayed as a war against Islam. Iran In describing Iran, Chomsky began by stating that Iran bears directly on Armenia because of their alliance in opposition to most other states of the region. He noted that the goal of reformists in Iran was to integrate the country in the global system, but this was rejected by the US. He also said that the oil industry would like to exploit the oil reserves and take advantage of more practical pipeline routes, but this is being blocked by US policies. Chomsky noted that this was one of the few cases where state policy is in conflict with domestic economic interests, which usually shape policy. He also noted that the policy has been pursued by successive administrations with broad congressional support, and the support of Israel and Turkey, but not Europe. He explained that this was part of an effort in diplomacy to maintain credibility, so that if a country steps out of line, they will be punished, in order to make them an example for others. He also cited the bombing of Serbia, and the policy toward Cuba as other examples. Iran broke the rules in 1979 when it removed itself from the US-dominated system, violated orders, and followed an independent course, he stated. Iraq Chomsky highlighted the diverging views of the US military and civilian leadership on whether the US should invade Iraq, citing the opposition in the military to an attack on Iraq. The reasons cited for an invasion are Saddam Hussein's development of weapons of mass destruction, and the use of chemical weapons against his people. While the reasons are valid, said Chomsky, they are 'transparently irrelevant' and are a tribute of the obedience of the educated classes. Chomsky noted that while the indictment was correct, it ignores, that Hussein did these things with our support, which continued long past the worst crimes he committed. He noted that the US and England continued to provide Hussein with dual-use technology for the development of weapons of mass destruction in the 1980s, although he was more dangerous during that period. Chomsky cited the real reasons for an invasion of Iraq, including the fact that it has the second-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia, and the US would not allow such reserves to be out of their control or allow privileged access to it by rivals. He also discussed the problem of regional attitudes, or the Arab opposition to an attack on a Muslim country, and the problem of regime replacement. He explained the US interest in keeping Iran isolated and maintaining control over Iraq's Kurdish population in the north, which is considered a threat by Turkey. Turkey Chomsky discussed other meanings of the phrase axis of evil as used in international discourse. He noted that the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram called the US, Turkey, and Israel the true axis of evil. In Bush's example, there is evil, but in the other case, there is an actual axis, said Chomsky, adding that there's plenty of evil to go around. Turning his attention to Turkey, Chomsky acknowledged that Turkey has been a US ally since the end of World War II, has a powerful military force, was valuable for its proximity to the Soviet Union, and was the recipient of a large flow of arms from the Us, which is the measure of how close an alliance is. During the Clinton years, the flow of arms was four times higher as during the entire Cold War period, revealed Chomsky. In 1997 alone, Clinton sent more arms to Turkey than during the entire Cold War period combined. The flow was so extreme that Turkey was the leader for the transfer of US arms, aside from Israel and Egypt. This flow of arms had nothing to do with the Cold War, and took place after the Cold War was winding down and ended, and increased after the Cold War through the late 1990s, said Chomsky. He noted, however, that these were the years that the Turkish operations against the Kurds were taking place. It began in 1994, atrocities escalated in the mid-1990s, and the flow of arms increased along with them. This is straightforward 'state terror,' a term borrowed from the [Turkish] Minister of Human Rights in 1994, when two million were driven from homes in the southeast. According to Chomsky, Kurdish human rights groups in Diyarbekir estimate that, by now, over three million refugees have been created by the attacks. He said it was very easy to find accounts of these barbaric atrocities in human rights reports, and that it is estimated that 50,000 Kurds have been killed. Chomsky called it 'states terror and even some of the worst international terrorism seen in the 1990s. He said that US support came not only through arms but also in the ideological realm, through silence: Keep it all under wraps, because if people here find out about it, they are not going to permit it, adding that an important task of the educated sector of society is to go along and make sure that people don't know anything about what is going on. It is extremely important not to let people know that they are participating in some of the worst atrocities of the time. He explained that this approach has been carried out very successfully in the US, as almost nobody knows about what was going on in Turkey. Chomsky noted that this was all going on at the same time as everyone was praising our commitment to principles of human rights in the late 1990s. He explained that the US and England were unwilling to tolerate atrocities near the border of NATO in Kosovo, but that worse atrocities were tolerated inside the borders of NATO. Chomsky described it as a tribute to the discipline and submissiveness of the educated sector, and as another kind of contribution to the atrocities. Chomsky admitted that it was not completely true that nothing was said about state terror in Turkey. He said there is some discussion of it, but that Turkey is lauded for it. He pointed out that the annual State Department report on terrorism in 1999s singled out Turkey for its positive experiences in countering terror. He also indicated that this assessment was considered perfectly reasonable when reported on the front page of the New York Times. In Fletcher Forum, US Ambassador to Turkey Robert Pearson recently credited Turkey for its positive accomplishment in countering terror and said the US can have no better ally in countering terrorism because of Turkey's achievements in countering terror. Pearson also said, It is no surprise that Turkey should be in the lead in joining the war against terror. Chomsky reminded the audience that Turkey was the first country to offer troops to the US after Sept. 11. He added that Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit declared that it was, as Chomsky put it, in gratitude for proving arms for the enormous state terror operation he was conducting. Chomsky said that Turkey has been selected by the US and England to fight the war against terrorism. He also pointed out that operations such as those carried out by Turkey in the southeast are always called counter-terror. He reminded the audience that the Nazis were protecting their populations from a terrorist threat - a reference to the various anti-Nazi resistance movements. US-Israel Relationship Discussing the US-Israel relationship, Chomsky stated that, since 1967, Israel has virtually become a US military base, and a significant one. It is a small country, but it has a huge military. Its air force, tank force, and advanced technology are greater than any in NATO aside from US. He said that it was essentially an offshore US military base, and that it performs other tasks as well throughout the world. Chomsky indicated that a major geopolitical outcome of the US war in Afghanistan was the establishment of a major US military base in Central Asia, and also in the Republic of Georgia. He said this is important for the natural resources there, but more for access to the Gulf region. Israeli-Turkish Relationship Chomsky noted that 12 percent of the Israeli air and tank force are now in eastern Turkey, and that they are probably operating in northern Iraq and moving toward the Iranian border. He cited this as being part of the growing conflict with the axis of evils, and against the local alliance of Iran and Armenian. He explained that Turkey relies heavily on the domestic Israeli lobby in Washington for its support. Chomsky said Turkey has received $30 billion from the World Bank and the IMF in the last year alone, and the Jewish lobby in favor of Turkey. He also added that this alliance is being extended to included Azerbaijan because of 30 million Azeris living in northern Iran, which the US would likely want dismembered as a state. Chomsky also discussed the conflicts taking place over the control of Caspian energy resources, with Turkish, Israeli, and US forces backing Azerbaijan. Small Armenia is caught up in the middle of all of this, he noted. Chomsky noted that Russia was certainly able to assess the balance of force in the region and so is behaving accordingly, at least for the moment. He described that balance as being Iran and Armenia on one side, and the US, Israel, Turkey, and Azerbaijan on the other side. He also explained that most of the conflict concerns pipeline routes from the Caspian avoiding Iran - a route that the energy companies prefer because it is more economical - and without Russia having any control, meaning that they would go through Georgia. Trial in Turkey Chomsky told the gathering that he was in Turkey in February for a political trial. He said because a series of his essays on US policy in the Middle East were translated into Turkish, the publisher was being charged in a military court. He noted that the essays included a few sentences taken from standard human rights reports on Turkish repression of the Kurds, which was the basis of the trial. He said that because of the television cameras from everywhere, except the US, the charges were dropped immediately because there was too much attention. Chomsky said he was optimistic because of the courage of people in Turkey struggling against legislation restricting free expression and representing ethnic identity. He noted that these activists have a lot of support, and that they are engaged in constant civil disobedience, which includes the publication of banned writings. He said what he saw was nothing like civil disobedience in the US, particularly because of the danger of imprisonment in Turkey. He stressed that they are constantly facing up to the danger. If they get support from the outside, they can win, he claimed. After the trial, Chomsky visited the southeastern part of Turkey, which he described as a dungeon. He cited examples of severe repression, including the arrest of the head of a local human rights commission for using the Kurdish spelling for the word referring to New Year's celebrations. He said people are sentenced for playing Kurdish music or wearing the colors of the Kurdish flag. He told of his surprise when, during a press conference in Turkey, he was presented with a Kurdish-English dictionary, which is banned, with an inscription about the desire to speak in their mother tongue. While this may not seem like an extreme demand, it is enough for torture and imprisonment, destroying people and villages, Chomsky commented. He also recalled that he was taken to see the remains of an Armenian church in Diyarbekir. He said there was not much left to it, that it was just ruins with no roof and pieces falling off. He was able to meet the caretaker of the church, an elderly man, and he learned that there was supposed to be a small Armenian community, but that no one talks much about it. That's what's left of this major center - another monument to Turkey's positive experiences in countering terror, commented Chomsky. Prof. Chomsky concluded by acknowledging the courage of the people in southeastern Turkey, and not just the intellectuals in Istanbul. Prof. Chomsky concluded by acknowledging the courage of the people in southeastern Turkey, and not just the intellectuals in Istanbul. He noted that it was impressive that people continue to struggle under those conditions, and said there is no excuse for inaction from people in places where they are fee and don't face this kind of repression. Background on the ANC In his introduction of Prof. Chomsky, Armenian Weekly editor Jason Sohigian provides historical background on the host organization - the ANC - as well as the ARF. He noted that the aims of the ARF as defined in 1919, include the establishment of a free, independent, and united Armenia. Sohigian explained that Armenian was caught in the crossroads of conflicting empires, and that the Armenian people faced conquest and persecution up to and through the creation of the Ottoman Empire. He described the founding of the ARF, in 1890, to organize the Armenian people to struggle for reforms in the Ottoman Empire. He noted that by 1915, these idealists were betrayed by Turkish Chauvinism, resulting in the Genocide. Sohigian provided an overview of the role of the ARF in the First Republic of Armenia, which surrendered to the Soviets in 1920 as a result of the threat of invasion by Turkey. He described the persecution of the ARF by the Soviets and development of a Diaspora of Armenians who were exiled after the Genocide. He explained Stalin's policies of dividing the ethnic groups of the Soviet Union, redrawing the South Caucasus so that parts of Soviet-controlled ancient Armenia were placed under the jurisdiction of Georgia and Azerbaijan. Sohigian also discussed the threat of assimilation to the Armenian people and the legacy of the Genocide and its ongoing denial. Sohigian discussed the revival of the Karabagh national liberation movement in the late 1980s. He explained the referendums held for self-determination and the violent response of the Azeris to these aspirations. Sohigian discussed the existence of Afghani mercenaries fighting against the Armenians of Karabagh, the attention paid to human-rights issues in the region by groups such as Sakharov Foundation, and the increasing role that oil geopolitics has come to play in the region. After Armenian independence in 1991, Sohigian explained, the ARF renewed its presence in Armenia. Sohigian also warned of the threat posed to Armenia as a result of the War on terrorism and the shifting balance of power in the region, a balance of endangered by the waiver, following Sept. 11, of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which had denied US aid to Azerbaijan because of its illegal blockade of Armenian. Sohigian described the world-wide network of ANCs, which urge their respective governments to assist the landlocked Republic of Armenian and fight against Genocide denial. He described the role of the ARF press, including the Hairenik, which has been publishing since 1899, and the Armenian weekly, both of which publish frequent action alerts from the ANC on human rights issues such as the persecution of the Kurds by Turkey. Sohigian explained that, back in 1990, Prof. Chomsky had written that he hoped to address the Armenian Genocide issue and human-rights violations being committed against the Kurds in future research. Sohigian noted this was now possible, and that Prof. Chomsky's recent visit to Turkey, including Diyarbekir, was the incentive for holding this Public Forum with the ANC to discuss his experiences and observations.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-06-29,1
"The mercurial president of Azerbaijan Heydar Aliyev is known for his double-talk and double loyalties, frequent lies and deceptions. As a ruthless former ruthless KGB general, he served under the Communist Politburo in Moscow for decades, surviving the dirty Byzantine-type communist politics during the Soviet era. He was assigned to the post of First Secretary of the Communist Party in Azerbaijan S.S.R., a Soviet province artificially created in 1920, which took its name from a geographical region called Iranian Aderbadagan, and inhabited by Tatars, Avars, Lezgis, Talish, Kurds, Russians and Armenians. In order to understand where the name of Azerbaijan comes from, it is useful to take a glimpse at the history of the region. Iran's northern region of Aderbadagan (Azerbaijan) used to be called Atropatene in times of antiquity; it was first a part of the Kingdom of Medes, and later became part of the Iranian stock, ancient Persians, Achaemenid, Parthian and Sassanian Empires. Following the conversion from Zoroastrianism to Islam, Iranian stock black-and-white sheep, Savafid and Qajar Dynasties, continued their control over the region, which included the eastern Georgia and entire southern section of the Caucasus, which was divided into the khanates of Erevan, Ganja, Nakhichevan, Karabagh, Sheki, Kuba, Shirvan and Talish. THE MOSAIC OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE The Persian Empire was a mosaic of diverse and multilingual culture, religious and ethnic groups. The majority spoke Farsi (Persian), while the minority groups spoke Luri, Baluchi, Assyrian, Turkmen, Arabic, Jewish, Kurdish, Armenian and Azeri. It is important to note that Azeris are Turkish-speaking Iranians rather than being a separate nationality groups (Turks). One can compare the Azeris with Hamshins who, in reality, are Armenian-speaking Muslims, Laz and Mskhaketian Turks who are Georgian-speaking Muslims. Following the decline of Iranian power. Czarist Russia conquered the region, and Iran was forced to renounce its claims on the Caucasus in the treaties of Golestan in 1813 and Turkmenchay in 1828. Following the Great October Revolution in Russia in 1917, Russians also withdrew from Caucasus, and Ottoman Turks followed suit after their defeat by the Entente powers in 1918 at the end of WWI. Following the collapse of Czarist Russia and the Ottoman Turkish Empire in 1918, the former German protectorate Georgian republic, British protectorate Azerbaijan Republic and the Entente powers protectorate Armenian Republic, which was studded by the genocide survivor refugees at that time, all declared their independence. Two years later, in 1920, the entire region fell under Russian Bolshevik domination. The Bolsheviks intended to spread communism into neighboring Turkey and Iran at a time when the Turks were waging a war of independence against French, British, Greek and Italian interventionists, and Iran was also struggling to maintain its independence from British imperialism. In order to influence the Iranian and Turkish political orientation, the Bolsheviks created an artificial state called Azerbaijan S.S.R, which included the former czarist province of Elisavetpol Gubernia, Baku Gubernia, and the Armenian-inhabited regions of Karabagh and Nakhichevan. The idea was dual - to please the Muslims of the East, and to have inroads into the Azer-speaking Muslim population residing in the northern Iranian province of Azerbaijan (Aderbadagan) and the Eastern province of Turkey (former Western Armenia). After the establishment of the Azerbaijan S.S.R, Baku officials took immediate steps to depopulate Nakhichevan from its Armenian population, and created an artificial swath of land between Armenia and Karabagh, which, in turn, became an Armenian enclave controlled by the Azeris. Prior to the communist takeover, Shushi had already been ethnically cleansed from its Armenian population under the Musavats, and now the rest of the Karabagh Armenians were destined to meet the fate of their cousins living under Ottomans, in the former Armenian Vilayets (provinces), and under the Azeris living in Nakhichevan and Shushi. EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES TAKEN After this preview and background information, one can easily comprehend why Heydar Aliyev and Azeri nationalists, like their counterparts in Turkey, are overreacting to the Armenian claims of genocide and Karabagh's quest for self-determination. Both the Azeris and the Turks have a guilty conscience and are aware that Armenians do have legitimate legal and historical claims. In order to maintain their control over the Armenian land and properties, both Ankara and Baku are taking extraordinary measures to weaken Armenia internally and internationally, with misinformation and vicious propaganda campaigns. First, one should analyze what Azeri President Aliyev is up to. After denying more than a year now that the Paris accord ever existed, Aliyev now suddenly makes public his version of the Paris accord, and falsely proclaims that, in the March 2001 meeting in Paris, President Kocharian agreed to exchange the Armenian territory of Meghri with Latchin, controlled by Karabagh Armenians. Both President Kocharian and Defense Secretary Serge Sarkisian vehemently deny that there was any such accord. Most political observers agree that Aliyev's lies were aimed at weakening Kocharian, at the time when some irresponsible members of the Armenian opposition, led by Ardashes Geghamian, Arkady Manucharian, Alexander Arzumanian, Babken Ararktsian, Vahan Chirkanian, Vazken Manukian and the Communists were - and are - repeatedly asking for the president's impeachment without any serious credible charges. With his cheap shots against Kocharian, Aliyev proved to be a sly provincial politician, not a world-class statesman, as his fans are trying to portray him. Rightfully so, an irritated President Kocharian accused his Azeri counterpart of seeking to destabilize the political situation in Armenia with controversial remarks, which were also criticized by the French President's office. Kocharian stated, I guess they (Azeris) thought they were giving the (Armenian) opposition new material to conduct an active campaign against him. Kocharian's leading opponent, Albert Bazeyan, who spearheaded the impeachment campaign against the president, realized the damage that irresponsible Armenian politicians were inflicting on the just cause of Karabagh and stated that he is ready to cooperate with the president to achieve a pro-American solution to the Karabagh conflict. So, Aliyev's mischief backfired; after all, even the most naive can see that Aliyev's motivation is to destabilize Armenia, to get rid of Kocharian and facilitate the return of former President Ter-Petrossian to power, who was ready for compromise. MINISTER AKARCALI TAKES CUE FROM PRESIDENT ALIYEV In a similar fashion, former Turkish Health Minister Bulent Akarcali had told the Armenian newspaper Haygagan Jamanak [Armenian Time] that the Diaspora is the major obstacle in the way of improving Armenian-Turkish relations. One should pay attention to how cynically the Turkish minister is trying to create a wedge between the two sections of the Armenian world, with the following statement: The main problem for the Diaspora is self-preservation through Genocide recognition, not helping to develop Armenia's statehood. HE continues, The Diaspora is failing to invest in Armenia and bring its skills to the country - a sentiment that is ironically shared by some Diasporan Armenians. Now, imagine a minister of the country, which is imposing an economic blockade against Armenia and arming Azeris to the teeth, lecturing Diasporan Armenians on how to help Armenia! The Turkish minister continues his cynical divisive tactics and, in patronizing fashion, blames the Diasporan Armenians for not helping Armenian! Perhaps he was convinced that all Armenians are dumbbells. In deceitful ways, he continues, The Armenian Diaspora is drinking wine in France and whisky in America, and wants to use Armenian statehood to strengthen its capacity for self-preservation. To achieve this, first of all it uses its anti-Turkish position. Not hiding his anger and frustration of the Genocide in the parliaments of different countries. What have you gained from all this? For two years you give your money, time and ideas as a gift to improve Armenian-Turkish relations, and you will see the result. Obviously the Turkish minister sees that the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the parliaments of France, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, Uruguay, Argentina, Russia, Cyprus, the Papal Office and now Canada is really forcing His country to the more realistic and conciliatory but gets very frustrated that the Diaspora is spoiling the Turkish ruling elite's attempt to rewrite history. Like Heydar Aliyev's latest failed stunt to destabilize Armenia, the Turkish minister is also failing to convince us that his country's intentions are good. One gets the impression that Turkish ruling elite's intent is to mislead Armenians and to force them to accept the Turkish version of history, and not to put forward any demands of what the Turks consider to be the resurrection of the infamous Treaty of Serves. This is why Armenians need to study Turkish and Azeri foreign policy goals and objectives by reading their academic publications, released by the Turkish and Azeri historical societies, Turkish and Azeri foreign ministries, and following the news media controlled by the Turkish and Azeri governments. Aware of the deceptive Turkish and Azeri political games and today's realities, the Armenian government is conducting face-to-face negotiations with Turks and Azeris on official levels and is trying to establish realistic ground for future relations among Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-06-29,1
"It is hard to imagine the sheer weight and magnitude of military and geopolitical issues currently facing the Bush Administration: waging the war against international terrorism, containing the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, confronting anti-Western fundamentalism in the Islamic world, and reaching out to European allies who are both at odds with the United States and restive for a new NATO mission to carry forward into the 21st Century. Remarkably, President Bush has been afforded a singular opportunity to move these paramount interests forward on the back of a relatively low-decibel, second-tier issue which has been hanging hin suspended animation for nearly three decades: Cyprus. In fact, a settlement which reunifies Cyprus before December 2002, when it will be formally invited to join the European Union, can be the key to achieving significant long-term progress on these and other major US foreign policy issues. It can also catalyze the advancement of Turkey's European vocation, the promotion of Turkey's secular democratic model among Muslim nations, and the significant improvement of Greek-Turkish relations, with attendant advantages for regional cohesion. On the other hand, a complete collapse of settlement efforts and Cyprus' subsequent EU accession without the Turkish Cypriot community could lead to a serious unraveling of US regional interests. Turkey would see its European future burn before its eyes, triggering new internal debate about the Western ambitions put forth by Kemal Ataturk. Greece would brace for renewed Aegean instability and disproportionately high defense budgets which would prevent the full development of its economy, among the EU's poorest. Greek Cypriots would celebrate EU accession without a shred of EU security, facing a permanent and sizable Turkish military force north of the Green Line. Turkish Cypriots would celebrate honor, pride, and steadfastness, as their meager standard of living stagnated in political, economic and international diplomatic isolation. Future settlement talks would be indefinitely suspended, and the likelihood of a permanent division of Cyprus would sharply increase. On a broader scale, America and Europe would face the prospect of sustained Greek-Turkish military tensions in the Aegean, in turn hampering NATO operations in the Balkan, Black Sea and eastern Mediterranean regions, weakening Western power projection in the Middle East, the Persian Gulf Central Asia, and encumbering military campaigns against Al Qaeda and Iraq. These are, at best, suppositions. What is absolutely clear is that, during the second half of 2002, something major, positive or negative, will occur in Cyprus. America and Europe must work hard and fast to achieve the positive and prevent the negative. MONITORED AND MANAGED Cyprus has long been perceived in Washington as an issue to be monitored and managed, primarily by the Department of State. This policy may have been adequate during the Cold War and shortly thereafter, but as the Cyprus issue comes to a head by year's end, the Administration should act immediately and decisively, supported by Brussels, to engage Turkey, Greece and both Cypriot communities to achieve a settlement before the EU accession calendar expires. The US can not afford failure in Cyprus, a sweeping breakdown in Greek-Turkish relations, a major disruption in NATO, and the regional consequences which might follow because the stakes are clear. Turkey, with the largest NATO army next the US, borders Iraq, Iran and Syria in the Middle East; controls the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits linking the Black and Aegean Seas; enjoys close military relations with Israel; and is taking over the command of the Afghan peacekeeping force from the British in June 2002. Greece has NATO's longest land border with the Balkans; helps secure Aegean maritime passage from the Turkish straits to the Mediterranean Sea; enjoys close political relations with many Arab governments; and adjoins energy pipelines from Libya and Egypt to Europe. Turkey and Greece are working to normalize relations and enhance bilateral cooperation in commerce, investment, counter-terrorism, cultural activities, education, and related areas. They are even working together in support of NATO membership for Bulgaria and Romania. But their icy relationship over the past four decades is rooted largely in Cyprus, over which they nearly went to war in 1974. Profound mistrust has dominated Greek-Turkish relations across the spectrum, most evidently manifested in their military and territorial disputes in, over and beneath the Aegean Sea. NO LONGER TOLERABLE These disputes have been costly to NATO, obstructing, delaying or causing the cancellation of military exercises, impacting alliance readiness and coordination, and ensuring that the alliance has been less than fully coordinated and prepared for operations in the region, such as the 1999 Kosovo campaign. Given the magnified demands of the current global security environment, especially those of the anticipated campaign against Baghdad, this is no longer tolerable. Just as the Cyprus problem has been at the crux of Greek-Turkish mistrust, so would a comprehensive Cyprus outcome, ideally composed of both a settlement and joint EU accession, form the heart of genuine Greek-Turkish partnership which would open the door for NATO's natural progression toward its southeastern flank in the 21st century. As NATO Secretary General Lord Robertson highlighted in an April 29 speech, major issues confronting the alliance in the Mediterranean region include the ongoing potential for political instability; its greater geographic vulnerability to terrorism; the need to normalize Arab-Western relations, especially within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction and its short-range missile distance from the eastern Mediterranean; emerging energy security issues concerning the Caspian and Caucasus regions; and economic disparities between Europe, the Middle East and northern Africa. Ronald Asmus of the Council on Foreign Relations stated crisply in a May 6 Washington Post analysis that the greatest common threats to American and European security emanate principally from a geographic area which extends from Israel eastward to Central Asia and includes the greater Middle East and the Persian Gulf. Failure to refocus NATO on this region, he added, runs the risk of presiding over the decline and eventual demise of the greatest alliance in history. Alarming developments in the past year embody the conceptual basis for pulling NATO's focus away from the relative serenity of Scandinavia and northern Europe, to the shores of the Middle East and northern Africa, within comprehensive reach of the West's most notorious enemies. Right now, Washington military planners are reviewing credible regime change options in 2003 against Saddam Hussein and his Baath Party structure, sending additional Special Forces to hunt down Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and building permanent military facilities in Central Asia. The US is also deploying troops in Georgia, has maintained thousands of peacekeepers in Kosovo and Bosnia, and is considering the deployment of ceasefire monitors in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. In Brussels, European military planners are beefing up their deployments in Afghanistan, preparing a peacekeeping force for FYROM (the Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia), and shoring up a Balkans presence in the event US troops are needed for combat elsewhere. It is self-evident, therefore, that NATO's future engagements do not lie on the north German plain, in the mountains of Norway, or on the shores of the Baltics, but in the Persian Gulf, Central Asia, the Middle East, the Caucasus, the Balkans, and the eastern Mediterranean. To consistently prevail in these regions, NATO must be freed of the technical, logistical and operational difficulties which emerge from Greek-Turkish disputes rooted in the mistrust over Cyprus. Fortunately, the Bush Administration has before it the best opportunity to achieve a Cyprus settlement which has eluded seven administrations since 1963. In so doing, the US could reinforce the Turkish-NATO security anchor; help move Turkey's EU accession process forward; cement Turkey's European orientation; and support the ongoing political, legal and economic reform movements in Turkey. SMASHING THE DIVIDE In addition, the joint accession of Greek and Turkish Cypriots to the EU would institutionalize an official Muslim presence in the bloc, smashing the psychological divide between Ankara and Brussels and laying waste to the argument of Islamic fundamentalists that Western outreach to the Muslim world is a sham. Simultaneously, the Bush Administration could provide bolstered cooperation in its relations with Greece, newly freed from Turkish entanglements, regarding Athens' efforts to tackle growing crises involving organized crime, trafficking in humans, and narcotics and arms smuggling traversing the southern Balkans, especially in neighboring Albania and FYROM. But there has been no significant movement in political negotiations which were restarted in Cyprus in January to achieve a bicommunal agreement by June, preferably, or even October, ultimately, when EU officials will submit their expected recommendation that Cyprus be among the 10 countries slated for accession to the bloc, with or without a prior settlement. Though Turkey in December 1999 agreed with the EU that Cyprus' accession would not be conditioned upon a settlement, Ankara has threatened to formally integrate northern Cyprus with Turkey if EU membership precedes a settlement. In so doing, Turkey would effectively occupy EU territory, destroying any hope of imminent negotiations to join the bloc in the near future. This would, in turn, provoke an anti-European, and perhaps anti-American, backlash within Turkey's body politic which would strengthen the country's Islamists at a time when the West seeks desperately to strengthen secular moderates in Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and other predominantly Muslim countries. Despite the best efforts of United Nations, American and international diplomats, a political settlement has not been achieved for a critical reason: there has been inadequate emphasis on security issues. Security is viewed simply as one element of the Cyprus negotiating process, along with territorial adjustments, compensation and political status. Negotiators have failed to address security on its own terms, which include the need for personal security for Turkish Cypriots, who fear a recurrence of the 1963-1974 bicommunal violence; strategic security for Greek Cypriots, who will not countenance a Turkish military presence in the north; and regional security for Turkey, which seeks to ensure that no hostile military force is stationed 40 miles off its southern coast. Greece has security interests as well, ranging from its substantial troop deployment in Cyprus to its obligations under a Joint Defense Doctrine to defend the island republic against Turkey in the event of hostilities. These are the reasons why Cyprus is, after the Korean peninsula, the second most militarized area in the world, home to 30,000 Turkish troops and 3,000 Turkish Cypriot security forces in the north, commanded by a Turkish officer reporting to Ankara, and 2,000-3,000 Greek troops and 14,000 Greek Cypriot National Guardsmen in the south, commanded by a Greek officer reporting to both Athens and Nicosia. Furthermore, the powerful influence of the Turkish General Staff on all matters in Turkey concerning Cyprus necessitates a prominent security dimension to the settlement process. The UN, knee-deep in the Cyprus problem since 1964, has had four decades to help solve it, and has failed. The EU is an economic bloc, struggling to achieve political consensus and incapable of providing a security umbrella for members and aspirants. The Cyprus settlement initiative will have to come from Washington. FULL-BLOWN CRISIS COULD EMERGE A diplomatic break-through in Cyprus should be a major and immediate priority for President Bush. The US should become actively engaged in promoting a Cyprus settlement now, not after the problem emerges as a full-blown crisis in the last few months of 2002. There are already too many front-burner issues with which the Bush Administration must contend. Addressing the Cyprus issue appropriately today could head off intra-alliance and regional crises tomorrow. American leadership requires bringing Turkish and Greek political and military leaders together to discuss the security environment in a post-settlement Cyprus. The Department of Defense should coordinate with the Department of State to facilitate Greek-Turkish military dialogue parallel to ongoing political negotiations between the two communities under UN auspices. A pre-settlement agreement on new security arrangements, to be implemented in the post-settlement phase, could sufficiently facilitate the political talks so that a settlement could be achieved within a time frame which would allow Greek and Turkish Cypriots to accede jointly to the EU. The signal to allies and partners in Ankara, Athens and Nicosia from President Bush should be clear: resolve the Cyprus problem, prepare for the joint accession of the two Cypriot communities to the EU, and look toward the unified republic's eventual membership in NATO. In so doing, Turkey, Greece, and even Cyprus can one day work together with their US and European allies to carry out the redirection of NATO's strategic mission toward its southeastern flank and meet the challenges of a region perpetually snarled in war, terrorism, fury, instability and crises which will unremittingly confront the West.

"The Israeli-Palestine conflict has been front-page news again for some time now, but the fact that Armenians have been quietly living in the midst of this turmoil is a topic seldom dealt with by the American media. The Krikor and Clara Zohrab Information Center of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America is pleased to present a non-Armenian's view of the ancient Armenian community of Jerusalem. An Israeli journalist and author, Yossi Klein Halevi, will speak about his impressions of the Armenians of Israel in the context of his broader spiritual journey on June 20 in a talk entitled A Jew Encounters the Armenian Passion: A Jew's Search for God with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land. Halevi, the Israel correspondent of the New Republic, as well as a frequent contributor to the Los Angeles Times, is the author of a new book: At the Entrance to the Garden of Eden: A Jew's Search for Hope with Christians and Muslims in the Holy Land. In it he describes a spiritual journey that he took to find a common spiritual language with his Christian and Muslim neighbors in the Holy Land. As a teenager raised in Brooklyn, Halevi was a radical follower of the right-wing zealot, Rabbi Meir Kahane, but soon turned against him and moved to Israel, where he, as a religious Jew, became an advocate of religious reconciliation. While religion has fueled the violent conflict plaguing the Middle East, Halevi wondered whether it could be a source of unity as well. To resolve this question, he began a two-year exploration of the devotional life of Christianity and Islam. He followed their holiday cycles, befriended Christian monastics and Islamic mystics, and joined them in prayer in monasteries and mosques - searching for wisdom and holiness in places that are usually off limits to outsiders from other faiths. Halevi candidly reveals how he fought to resolve his own fears and anger as a Jew to relate to Christians and Muslims as fellow spiritual seekers. He chronicles the difficulty of overcoming, political, historical, and psychological - that separate believers of the three monotheistic faiths. In his book, Halevi appears to have a special sympathy for the Armenians. He spends a good deal of time on the Armenian Genocide and the effects it has has on the Jerusalem Armenian community. Perhaps this is due to the fact that his own father was a Holocaust survivor (the 1985 award-winning documentary film Kaddish, by Steve Brand, focuses on Halevi's relationship with his father). Halevi writes: Both the Armenians and the Jews, after all, possessed a national saga of destruction and rebirth, which Armenians naturally interpreted through the language of crucifixion and resurrection. (pp. 150-151) Halevi's lecture will no doubt lead to lively and stimulating discussion. It will begin at 7 p.m. at the Guild Hall downstairs at the Armenian Diocese (630 Second Avenue and 35 St.), in New York. Admission is without charge, and the public is welcome. For further information, call (212) 686-0710 ext. 63 or email: zicoff@armeniandiocese.org. Photograph (Yossi Halevi)",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-06-15,1
"The two dozen scholars who gathered at the International Institute on March 7-10 come together to discuss what to outsiders might seem a rather esoteric topic: Contextualizing the Armenian Experience in the Ottoman Empire: From the Balkan Wars to the New Turkish Republic. But underlying, and always present, in the intense and informed discussions were the painful and divisive disputes over the events of 1915, the deportations and massacres of hundreds of thousands of Ottoman Armenians, and the need for careful consideration of their causes. In order for scholars to their work, they require a degree of calm and quiet, and the University of Michigan provided just such an atmosphere for deliberation and respectful exchange. From as far away as Ankara, Turkey, and Bochum, Germany, historians and political scientists, sociologists and anthropologists interested in the late Ottoman Empire and the fate of its Armenian subjects crowded into a modest room to talk about topics that have led Turks and Armenians not only to question what constitutes the facts about the past, but to the most violent forms of scholarly and political attacks. In the Michigan workshop, formal papers were submitted in advance, read by the workshop members, and then discussed at length in lively but restrained conversations. The workshop was the second in a series of such meetings and followed a controversial first gathering at the University of Chicago two years earlier. UNDERSTANDING A COMPLEX EVENT The workshop was organized by Professors Fatma Muge G?ocek (Sociology and Women's Studies, Michigan) and Ronald Grigor Suny (Political Science, Chicago). The premise of the workshop was that in order to understand why ethnic cleansing and genocide occurred, the larger historical context - the tensions between the Armenians and the Turks, the ways in which the Turks constructed the Armenians as subversive and dangerous elements, the defeats and threats of the world war - had to be explored. Suny opened the proceedings with a review of the Armenian and Western historical writing on the massacres and deportations of 1915, followed by a parallel paper by G?ocek on the Turkish historiography. Suny proposed that the standard accounts left little room for understanding the complexity of the events. Existing histories attempt to explain the massacres by reference to religion or nationalism without fully considering that the Young Turks were secular modernizes dedicated to presenting an empire. Up to now much of Armenian historiography blamed the Turks, gave little active role to the Armenians, and linked all of Ottoman history into a story that led inexorably to genocide. The official Turkish view, promoted by the state and its supporters, denied the Genocide and claimed that There was no genocide, and the Armenians are to blame. Suny proposed that not all reparations of Armenians by Turks were part of a single teleological process that led inevitably to genocide, that Ottoman governments had a variety of policies and ambitions vis-a-vis the Armenians, and that their attitudes towards Armenians radicalized as World War I broke out. By the time the Young Turks went to war with Russia in late 1914, there was nothing that the Ottoman Armenians could do to present the leaders of the empire from carrying out their evolving plans to eliminate one of their subject peoples. Gocek reviewed the shift from the late Ottoman writing on 1915, which recognized that massive killing had taken place, to the historiography of the Turkish republic in which deliberate misuse of the historical record became the norm. As the Republican scholars aimed to prove the Turkish thesis and thereby protect the interests of the state, rather than understand what had actually happened, they reached the ironic and bizarre conclusion that it was the 1915 victims themselves who were the actual perpetrators, and the former Turkish perpetrators became the victims. As a consequence, the events of 1915 were dismissed as an act of Turkish self-defense. Gocek showed that the official Turkish nationalist narrative put primary blame for the events on the imperialist Western powers that desired the partition of the empire and used the Ottoman minorities as an instrument in their plans. This historiography was also part of a state project to counter the Armenian allegations of genocide that, in the 1970s, had led to the assassination of Turkish diplomats by Armenian militants. TURKISH POST NATIONALIST NARRATIVE In recent years, a few Turkish scholars have moved to a post-nationalist narrative, despite officials political pressure, and are attempting to write a more objective and critical account. Scholars like Halil Berktay (History, Sabanci University, Istanbul), Taner Akcam, Taner Timur, and others have based new accounts of the massacres and deportations on careful reading of Ottoman and Turkish documents. Timur calls for the Turks to recognize that what started as a reform effort in 1908 turned into the rule of a bloody committee. In this context, what is termed an Armenian genocide is indeed a massacre and no reason can justify it. Historian Fuat Dundar argues that the Young Turks aimed at creating an ethnically homogeneous homeland in Antolia, what would later become the foundation of the modern Turkish nation-state. Sukru Hanioglu shows in a two-volume study of the Young Turks up to 1908 that the more ecumenical and tolerant Ottomanist facade displayed in their public rhetoric concealed a more Turkish nationalist core. Their overtures to the Armenian political parties, some of which remained allied to the Young Turks until 1912, were never based on a conviction that Turks and Armenians would be equal partners in an Ottoman state. In addition to the few historical works, fiction by Turkish Armenians has raised the awareness of many Turks to the blank spots in their early twentieth-century history. Gocek ended her presentation with the optimistic expectation that the future integration of the Turkish Republic into the European Union could be identified with the beginning of the demise of Turkish nationalism and of the subsequent recognition of the wrongful Armenian deaths in 1915. The veteran scholar of the Genocide, sociologist Vahakn Dadrian, disputed Suny's decoupling of the Genocide from earlier Turkish massacres and for downplaying the significance of Islam as a cause of the violence. Dadrian claimed that Islam is a dogma that does not change and that the majority of massacres occurred on Fridays after Muslim service when clerics called for Jihad against Armenians. ROLE & NATURE OF ISLAM EXPLORED Fikret Adanir (History, Ruhr University, Bochum) intervened to point out that Islam is not monolithic, but it was instrumentalized by some and turned into a weapon against Christians at times. He was followed by a young Turkish scholar, Soner Cagaptay (History, Yale), who reiterated that there is no single Islam. Islam can be a faith, an ideology, a culture, or an identity. Particularly lethal in the Ottoman Empire was the coming of modernity, when older religious notions were threatened. There had been no destruction of Armenians in Turkey before the nineteenth century. Stephan Astourian (History, Berkeley) mentioned that thousands of Armenians were saved by Muslims. Aron Rodrigue (History, Stanford) added that Islam provided a discursive divide between Muslims and non-Muslims; it gave people a way at looking at those who were different. Eric D. Weitz (History, Minnesota) looked at the general phenomenon of twentieth-century genocides and linked them to the dark side of the Enlightenment. Following arguments made by Hannah Arendt and Zygmunt Bauman about the pernicious aspects of modernity - new technologies of warfare, enhanced state powers of surveillance, ideologies and governmental practices that categorized people according to race and nation - he argued that genocides occur when the normal rules of human interaction are suspended and the practice of violence is honored and rewarded. Race thinking was central to the genocides of our own time, said Weitz, and when taken up by revolutionary transformative regimes with powerful vision of the future, the potential for intentional, state-initiated mass killing is enhanced. War, revolution, and racism created a culture of killing that marked the last century as horrifically different from its predecessors. Rodrigue also engaged the comparison between the Armenian Genocide and the Jewish Holocaust, beginning with an elaboration of the particularities of the Ottoman social system and its breakdown in the nineteenth century. Defined by religious difference, Muslim and non-Muslim were always unequal in the fixed hierarchy of the Ottoman world, with Muslim as the governing element and Islam the governing religion. But the coming of Western influence and pressure, the new alternative vision of nationalism, and the modernizing and centralizing practices of the Ottoman state disturbed profoundly the established relations between religions communities. Western domination, both internationally and in domestic economic life, led to a perception on the part of many Muslims of non-Muslims as collaborators of the foreigners, whose ultimate aim was the destruction of the empire. In the script of the Ottoman rulers, the Armenians, who had been an inferior, now had become superior, not only rich, but collaborators with foreigners, in fact foreigners themselves working for the destruction of the state. OTTOMAN MUSLIM NATIONALISM While Turkish nationalism inspired the Young Turks, they were primarily out to save their empire, not to build a nation-state. Echoing historian Erik Jan Zurcher, Rodrigue argued that the core ideology of the rulers is best described as Ottoman Muslim nationalism. The Turkish sense of an Armenian threat stemmed from the Armenians' strategic location in the lands that lay in the path of the invading Russians and the favor with which they were regarded by the Great Powers. By 1915 a particularly fatal combination of resentment, humiliation, and revengeful sentiment animate the ruling elite, which had suffered losses in the Balkans, defeat at the hands of the Russians at Sarikamish, and faced an Allied landing at Gallipoli. While the Armenian Genocide took place as an empire tried to save itself, the Holocaust occurred at the moment when a modern nation-state under the Nazis pushed toward making a new empire based on race. Jews had long occupied a separate and inferior position in European societies, but in the nineteenth century they acquired new rights and experienced a steady embourgeoisement and a rapid upward mobility. Jews became the lightening rod for all kinds of grievances, and in the thinking of scientific racists of the late nineteenth century, something, had to be done about them to save the Aryans. Redemptive anti-Semitism was central to Nazism, but the practice of physically exterminating them was implemented only after the German invasion of Russia. Rather than following Bauman and Weitz in their vision of modernity as the culprit, Rodrigue argues that Nazism destroyed and perverted the modern state governed by a charismatic leader. Richard G. Hovannisian (History, UCLA) explained that Armenian scholarship, like writing on the Holocaust, was divided between intentionalists, who see a longtime Turkish intention to commit genocide, and functionalists who saw the events as much more contingent and the result of perceived threats during the war. He argued that this dichotomy was greatly exaggerated and that the functionalist and intentionalists views could coexist. There certainly were intentionalists among the top Young Turk leaders, he said. Clearly influenced by Holocaust scholarship that has proposed an increasingly radical policy of the Nazis toward the Jews, Donald Bloxham (History, Southampton, England), presented a controversial paper on cumulative radicalization during the Armenian Genocide. He argued that war was a key ingredient that led to mass killing of civilians. The Turkish policy became progressively more radical as the government saw the Armenians as a dangerous fifth column within their country. It was not until June 1915, he claimed, that the policy became genocidal, that is, deportations turned into systematic mass murder. Fikret Adanir made the essential point that the military disasters of the Balkan War of 1912-1913, in which the Ottomans lost almost all of European Turkey, were a major turning point in the history of Ottoman policies toward minorities. The defeat led to the establishment of the one-party dictatorship in January 1913, the essential abandonment of the pluralistic Ottomanist project, and its replacement by an aggressive nationalism that aspired to a new mobilization along Turkish-Islamic lines. A heightened panic about losing Anatolia gripped the Young Turks. At the same time, the Armenian political leaders turned from working with the Young Turks to appeals, once again, to the Great Powers as a way to solve the Armenian Question. The attempts by the Young Turks to mobilize Christians into the Ottoman army met with resistance from the non-Muslims, particularly the Greeks, and the early defeats in the Balkan Wars were seen by many, including foreign observers, as the result of the defections by Christian soldiers. Ottomanism as a multicultural project, says Adanir, ended on the battlefields of Thrace. NO PLACE LEFT FOR NON-MUSLIMS The late Ottoman rulers faced the central problem of how to create a national consensus, a shared sense of Ottoman identity, in a multinational empire. Several papers made the case that, as Turkish nationalism developed, it left no place for non-Muslims. A non-Muslim could not be a Turk, Rodrigue claimed. This problem remained acute even in the new Turkish republic of the 1920s. Marc David Baer (History, Chicago) demonstrated how a small group of Jews who had converted to Islam in the seventeenth century found themselves marginalized, even threatened, as a narrow, racialized idea of Turkishness prevailed among many intellectuals. In a fascinating parallel to nineteenth-century German racial science discourses about German Jews, the Salonikans or Donme were seen as a threat to the Turkish nation, as foreigners who led secret lives and had inordinate financial power. Using oral history and a recovered diary, Leyla Neyzi (Anthropology, Sabanci University, Istanbul) reconstructed the story of Yasar Paker, born Haim Albukrek, a Turkish Jew who was conscripted into the nationalist army to fight during the Greco-Turkish War. Unlike the Christians, Jews were not seen as a threat by the Turks, but as a distinct group. Albukrek was reluctant but willing to fight with the Kemalists, and in later life he readily assimilated into Turkish national life. Similarly, Soner Cagaptay looked at the surviving Armenians in the republican period when conflicting definitions of belonging to the Turkish nation and being a Turkish citizen co-existed. Ataturk's Turkey had a civic idea of citizenship: The People of Turkey, regardless of religion and race, are Turks as regards Turkish citizenship. But at the same time it conceived of the Turkish nation as a cultural and linguistic community, and, as Cagaptay emphasized, even in the secular Kemalist republic Islam was part of the definition of the nation. Turkish nationalism nurtured an aversion towards the Christians. Under pressure from the state, the non-Muslim communities renounced the rights granted them in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. Their political situation deteriorated significantly during the 1920s; their religious institutions were threatened; and many of the thousands of Armenians left in Anatolia began to emigrate. Armenian nationalists abroad organized resistance to Turkish policies, even playing a significant role in the Kurdish rebellion of 1930s, and this deepened the existing Turkish suspicion of Armenians. Even Armenians who had converted to Islam were suspect. Religion created an ethnic boundary between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Kemalist continuity of millet attitudes rendered Turkey's Armenian citizens an alien nation within the polity. In his exploration of the sorrow of early Turkish nationalism, Halil Berktay (History, Sabanci University) characterized the mood of many in the late Ottoman period as a pent-up and frustrated, vengeful sort of Turkish nationalism, which played its part as one of the vectors in Enver's and Talat's precipitous rush to the unprecedented decisions of 1915. Berktay argued that demonology of enemies precedes the constitution of a pantheon of gods and heroes in nationalism and orients the incipient nation in contested space, providing a program that can justify violence, ethnic cleansings, and settling accounts. What he calls the even of 1915 was not primarily ideologically pre-mediated, but was made possible by hateful and vengeful Turkish nationalism that was at least present in the air by that time. DOCUMENTS CONTRADICT PROPAGANDA One of the most outspoken and courageous Turkish historians of the Armenians Genocide, Taner Akcam showed how Ottoman archival documents directly contradict the officials Turkish state narrative of the event of 1915. He argued that the Young Turks implemented a general resettlement plan for ethnic and religious minorities in Anatolia between 1913 and 1918 and that a decision to cleanse Anatolia of non-Muslim elements was made at the beginning of 1914. These plans applied, not only to Armenians, but to Arabs, Kurds, Albanians, Bosnians, and others, and wee directed at the Turkification of Anatolia, which after the Balkan Wars was conceived as the heartland of the Turks. Armenians, however, were thought of and treated differently from other minorities. There were no qualms about killing Armenians, and Akcam stated that the documents suggested a genocidal intention on the part of the ruling party. Stephan H. Astourian proposed that a social, even ecological, dimension must be added to the more ideological and political explanations for genocide. When the relatively stable ethnic and religious social order in which different groups accept their inequitable positions in separate social niches begins to break down, groups begin to compete for the same resources under conditions that can be called niche overlap. Such a situation occurred during the last Ottoman half century in eastern Anatolia and Cilicia, regions inhabited by large Armenian populations. Millions of Muslim refugees from the Caucasus and the Balkans migrated into Anatolia, increasing pressure on the limited resource of arable land. Beginning in the 1870s, Armenians began to complain to the Ottoman Porte about land seizures and other oppressive acts they were suffering at the hands of Kurds, Turks, Circassians, and other Muslims in the eastern provinces. When the government did little to redress these grievances, Armenians appealed to foreign powers, and the internationalized Armenian Question was born. Astourian argues that Sultan Abdulhamid II (1876 - 1909) aimed at the systematic de-Armenization of eastern Anatolia, which was carried out by usurpation of land, settlement of Muslims in the region, emigration of Armenians from the empire, and the devastating massacres of 1894-1896 in which an estimated 150-200,000 Armenians were killed. The young Turks, who came to power in 1908, essentially continued the Sultan's demographic and land expropriation policies. A different pattern of social development in Cilicia, nevertheless, led to violence. In this fertile region at the very northeastern corner of the Mediterranean, the pacification of local tribesmen and the establishment of cotton production produced great wealth, and Armenians and Greeks acquired land and property in the late nineteenth century. But in the chaos of the counter-revolutionary coup of 1909, local Turks in Adana massacred some 20,000 Armenians. Here economic envy and competition contributed to mass killing. Astourian concluded to mass killing. Astourian concluded that the patterns of state centralization and modernization, demographic engineering and economic competition, particularly over land, as well as the political choices made by Abdulhamid II were at the root of the catastrophe of 1915. CILICIAN EXPERIENCE Continuing the investigation of Cilicia, historian Aram Arkun turned to the genocide in the regions of Zeytun, Marash, Hajin, and Sis. In careful detail he told the story of miscalculation and deception that led to the first deportations, those from the mountain town of Zeytun. At first Zeytuntsis were sent in caravans to Konya in central Anatolia, and only later were the deportations rerouted to the deserts of Syria. Arkun documents the mood of ordinary Muslims, whom foreign observers noted were hostile to the Armenians and easily mobilized to carry out killings. At the same time several Turkish governors in the region were opposed to wholesale deportations and killings, but they were eventually removed from office and replaced by men more determined to carry out the orders from Istanbul. Hans-Lukas Kieser (History, University of Basel) told the story of one of the Turkish governors, Dr. Mehmed Reshid, a dedicated Young Turk who carried out the massacres in Diarbekir. A Circassian by origin, Reshid Bey was, like many of his generation, influenced by right-wing European political and nationalist writers. He was driven by the question of how the empire could be saved. Though earlier he had condemned the Hamidian regime for its massacres of Armenians, he was radicalized after the Balkan wars to see Greeks and Armenians as an internal danger to the empire. By his own admission, as governor of Diarbekir, he supervised the removal of 120,000 Armenians, most of whom were massacred or died from exhaustion. Captured after the war, Reshid Bey committed suicide rather than face trial. Dadrian spoke on the practice of genocide denial and laid out the essential theses of the official Turkish position: that there was no intention to deport or kill Armenians; that the atrocities were beyond the control of the authorities; that the killing was regional not general; that the numbers killed are far lower than Armenians claims, and Turks suffered as much if not more than Armenians; that the unfortunate events were the result of a civil war between Turks and Armenians: and that the events were provoked by Armenian treachery and rebellion. As in his voluminous writings, so in his oral presentation, he went on to demonstrate that each of these propositions was false and that staggering amounts of evidence have been published, most convincingly in Turkish and German sources, that show the widespread practice of deportation and massacre and the direct role of the Young Turks. Hovannisian reminded the workshop that while Young Turks were both the initiators and the dynamic behind the Armenian Genocide, there were also officials and ordinary Turks who refused to participate even at the risk of their own lives. In a paper that discussed intervention and altruism during the massacres, he shared material from hundreds of oral histories of Armenian survivors, many of whom testified to self-sacrificial acts by Muslims. Although other exploited the vulnerability of Armenians to take economic and sexual advantage of their former neighbors, the motivations of those who helped victims ranged from sympathy and pity to the most opportunistic effort at economic betterment. Altruism, however, often successfully competed with economic self-interest. CONTEMPORARY ISSUES A final session of the workshop turned to contemporary issues. Baskin Oran (Political Science, Ankara University) used the story of the Armeno-Turkish newspaper Agos to illustrate the revival of Armenian identity in today's Turkey. Until the appearance of Agos, the Istanbul Armenian community was subjected to attacks in the Turkish media and had few avenues to express its own views to the larger Turkish public. Agos began publication, in Turkish, in 1966 and cautiously attempted to present a Turkish-Armenian position different from that of the Armenian Diaspora and the Republic of Armenia. On the issue of the Genocide, Agos editor Hrant Dink argued that Turkish-Armenian relations should be taken out of a 1915 meters-deep well. That question should be depoliticized and dealt with by historians. In a similar spirit of opening up paths of dialogue between Turks and Armenians, a number of leading public figures established the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) in July 2001. Razmik Panossian (Government, London School of Economics) related the short five-month history of this abortive effort. The principal cause of the failure of TARC, according to Panossian, was not the genocide issue per se but the commission's confusion about how to deal with the question. TARC was designed as a private civil society initiative with no formal links to governments, largely promoted on the Armenian side by the Armenian Assembly, a Washington-based advocacy organization. Turkish commissioners saw TARC as an alternative to European efforts at recognizing the Genocide through parliamentary resolutions. From the beginning, those who had been fighting for recognition, like the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnaktsutiun), opposed TARC, while the Turkish media was positive or neutral on the commission. Yet none of the Turkish commissioners considered the events of 1915 to be a genocide, while those on the Armenian side did. Instead of dialogue there was an impasse. In a comprehensive survey of Armenian-Turkish relations in the 1990s, Jirair Libaridian explicated the policies of the governments of the Republic of Armenia toward Turkey and their connections to the issue of genocide. Early on, President Levon Ter-Petrossian, with whom Libaridian worked as a principal advisor, attempted to establish diplomatic relations with Turkey, but even as the two countries nearly reached agreement, events such as the conflict over Karabagh prevented formal relations. At first Armenia was willing to separate the issue of genocide from the question of diplomatic relations, but with the coming to power to Robert Kocharian, Armenia stated that it would not give up genocide recognition but that it had no territorial claims on Turkey. Summing up some of the discussion, Libaridian pointed out that We don't know everything, and we haven't decided everything. This is a healthy attitude. The workshop demonstrated that the very word genocide has become a battlefield, but that it is possible to talk sensibly about what happened. Facts can be established; arguments can be made; and the old stories, the master narratives, can be changed. CAUSES AND TRIGGERS While some participants were wary that by explaining the genocide, it might be explained away, a distinction can be made between factors that led to events and the actual policies and decisions that made them happen. Paul Boghossian (Philosophy, New York University) pointed out that a distinction must be made between causation and justification. Causal claims are descriptive whereas justificatory claims are normative. Pointing to the cause of some event does not necessarily justify it. Since nothing can justify genocide, no one should fear that an honest investigation of the role of the Armenians in the events of 1915 could lead to a justification of the tragedy that befell them. Commenting on Bloxham's claim that there was a cumulative radicalization of Turkish policy towards the Armenians culminating in deportations and massacres, Boghossian pointed out that there is a distinction between causes and triggers. A cause of an event is something without which that event would not have occurred, whereas a trigger is simply an opportunity for a cause to bring about a given event. Bloxham, he argued, had shown that wartime conditions, rather than causing the massacres of 1915, had merely provided triggers for them. Finally, to those who recoil from the use of the word genocide for strategic or emotional reasons, even while acknowledging the terrible events, he said that it was incumbent upon them to come up with their own terms, ones that would not distort the factual reality that had been established by the workshop - that intentional mass killing, directed against a specifically named ethno-religious people, had been ordered and executed by a government in 1915. After three intense days of productive discussions, the workshop adjourned to a public session at which, Suny, Michael Kennedy (Sociology, Michigan), Director of the International Institute and Vice Provost of International Affairs, and two journalists from Turkey, Cengiz Candar and Hrant Dink, gave their impressions of the workshop. Candar said that the workshop was an unprecedented scholarly endeavor and hoped that the findings would be released soon to the public. Dink said that for an Armenian journalist like himself, living in Turkey, it is difficult to speak of genocide. One becomes an enemy of one's own nation or the state. It is like living on a razor blade. But the Michigan workshop gives hope that this problem can be solved by dialogue between the two peoples. Gocek read Berktay's reflections on the reception of the earlier Chicago workshop in Turkey and the Armenian Diaspora. He cautioned against over-attachment to the world genocide and suggested that if the Holocaust was the event that gave rise to the word, then the Armenian killings might be referred to as a proto-genocide. Inevitably the work of historians has political implications and effects, but there is a difference between the critical activity of scholars, their search for truth, and more directed political activity, which should be left outside the academy. Some in the audience were unhappy that the workshop organizers had not allowed more participation of people from the community in the deliberations. After listening to the increasingly heated discussion between public and participants, Baskin Oran quietly pointed out that the polemical and partisan discussion at the public session illustrates why scholars have to meet by themselves to carry on their indispensable work. The University of Michigan and its International Institute had provided just such a possibility for debate and discussion free from polemic.","Gocek, Mug",Armenian Reporter International,2002-06-15,1
"I attended an extraordinary conference on the Armenian Genocide in Copenhagen on May 10-11 of this year. It was extraordinary not only because of the sound scholarship of those who presented the evidence of the genocide and its denial but also because of the blatant attempt of the Turkish government to hijack the proceedings. The conference, held at the University of Copenhagen, was sponsored by the Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, in cooperation with Aarhus University and the University of Southern Denmark. The moving force behind the conference was Professor Eric Markusen, a scholar known for his exposure of deniers of the Armenian Genocide and who proposed that this conference deal specifically with the issue of denial. In consultations with Dr. Vahakn Dadrian and Professor Richard Hovannisian, the organizers put together a program that included a number of European specialists on the Armenian Genocide, as well as activists seeking official international recognition of the crime. At the suggestion of the organizers, it was decided to concentrate the first day on denial of the genocide, and then to consider in a roundtable on the second day the appropriateness of seeking legislative affirmation, as done in a number of countries, most recently France. TURKS SEEK BALANCE When the Turkish Embassy in Copenhagen learned of the conference, it began to urge the organizers to allow for a certain balance by including persons who would present the Turkish view. Representations were apparently also made to the Danish Embassy in Ankara. The diplomatic intercession prompted the organizers to propose that, on the second day of the conference, a Turkish representative by heard about the appropriateness of legislative action on recognition. It was to be only in the context of this subject, however, and not one in which a forum would be provided for denial by the Turkish government. Professors Dadrian and Hovannisian conceded to this arrangement, but soon found that this opened the door to additional changes. By the time the conference began, the title had been altered from The Armenian Genocide and Its Denial to The Armenian Question: Allegations and Denial. For the uninformed, it would have been difficult to discern what the Armenian Question was and who was alleging and who was denying. During all this time, the Turkish Embassy continued to work politely and diplomatically to open the door wider, making a case for having not only Gunduz Aktam, a longtime Turkish ambassador and member of the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC), to participate in the roundtable but also to include a Turkish member of parliament. But, by the time the final program was printed, there were now two Turkish ambassadors and two members of parliament, representing the leadership of two political parties. The two ambassadors were present during most of the proceedings but the two parliamentarians came only to the session in which they were scheduled to speak, armed with packets of denial documents and accompanied by photographers and correspondents. In the background at all times was the counselor of the Turkish Embassy, who carried a large file from which, on certain given queues, he would extract questions and documents to hand to the Turkish spokesmen in an inane effort to challenge the evidence of the Armenian Genocide. Fortunately, both Dr. Dadrian and Dr. Hovannisian were able to discredit such attempts by citing chapter and verse when it came to the evidence. ARMENIAN PRESENTATIONS MASTERFUL AND POWERFUL The conference began on May 10 with opening comments by the Director of the Holocaust and Genocide Studies Center, Professor Uffe Ostergard, followed by the first session chaired by Professor Markusen. Dr. Dadrian presented a masterful discourse on the Armenian Genocide, laying out in a clear and methodical fashion the evidence, primarily German and Turkish, of the premeditated and comprehensive destruction of the Armenian population by the Young Turk authorities and the Special Organization. Professor Hovannisian continued with an equally powerful expose of the shifting strategies of denial of the Armenian Genocide from the time of its perpetration to the present. Drawing on the Turkish sources and authors themselves, he showed how denial had moved from partial acceptance immediately after World War I, to absolute denial and attempted repression of memory under the Kemalist regime, and, when that was not fully successful, to the invention of arguments to rationalize and to relatives the calamity. The interventions of the two Turkish ambassadors and their counselor during these presentations were ineffectual as they were met with strong, convincing responses. The afternoon session on the first day included statements by Ragip Zarakolu of the Turkish Human Rights Association on the impact of the Armenian Genocide and it denial in contemporary Turkey, by Dr. Helene Piralian of Paris on the impact of denial on descendants of the survivors, and by Rupen Boyadjian of Zurich and Christopher Arzrouni of Copenhagen on the outlook of the third generation. Dr. Henning Lehmann of Aarhus University concluded the day with a moving account of Danish reactions to the Armenian Genocide and attempts to assist the survivors by such dedicated humanitarians as Karen Jeppe and Maria Jacobsen. It was on the second day of the conference that the attempted hi-jacking took place. In a roundtable that was supposed to be devoted to the appropriateness of legislative bodies to act on recognition of the Armenian Genocide, Nicolas Tavitian, executive director of the Forum of European Armenian organizations, presented a clear and cogent overview of past and present parliamentary initiatives; member of the Swedish Parliament Murad Artin spoke on the legislative action in his country; and German researchers Wolfgang Gust and Dr. Tessa Hofmann of the Free University of Berlin focused on the German role in and evidence on the genocide. The first Turkish response was given by Ambassador Pulat Tacat, who recited in sequence the line of arguments that Professor Hovannisian had outlined the previous day, asserting in addition that passage of resolutions calling on Turkey to recognize the genocide had been influenced by threats of Armenian reprisals and terrorism. Then, the bluster intensified with the Turkish parliamentarians, Bulent Akarcali, deputy leader of the Motherland Party, and Dr. Bayram Dayanikli of the Democratic Left Party. The pair created a stir, not only by having packets of blatant denial literature distributed but also by their outbursts while others were speaking. Akarcali, who had denounced the conference and the Holocaust-Genocide Center in the Turkish press prior to his arrival, was particularly shameless in his behavior and in his fingerprinting denial arguments. He denounced the Christian missionaries who, he said, had intentionally incited the Armenians and created a divide with the benevolently disposed Turks. The current problem hindering Armenian-Turkish relations, he insisted, was the Armenian Diaspora with its violent fringes. He could only nod his head condescendingly, however, when I described my own witnessing of the disappearance but still-surviving memory everywhere of the Armenian villages in the plain of Erzerum and the cultured, progressive community of Ordu, the birthplaces of my parents CALL TO ABANDON THE GENOCIDE ISSUE On his part, Dr. Dayanikli admonished the Armenians to abandon the genocide issue, pointing to the fact that the current Armenian republic was in dire straits, that much of its population had emigrated, and that pensioners received a pittance and even physicians, such as himself, received no more than 20 dollars a month, if they were lucky. Hence, if diasporan Armenians wish to help Armenia, they must put the genocide question aside and concentrate on improving and normalizing Armenian-Turkish relations. Throughout these offensive declarations and exclamations, the scholars who had come to address the topic of the conference maintained a proper demeanor, without the demonstrative gestures that characterized the presentations of the Turkish deniers. Dr. Dadrian did respond by showing how the package of denial literature that the Turkish counselor had placed on each desk was full of falsehoods and distortions created by taking various passages entirely out of context. Nonetheless, a cloud had settled over the conference, in part because the organizers seemed to be at a loss as to handle the brash behavior of the Turkish officials or to insist on bringing the discussion back to the original topic of the roundtable. Having performed their duties, the two members of the Turkish Grand National Assembly disappeared, leaving the afternoon to the ambassador who was the only person associated with the Turkish government originally scheduled to speak. Gunduz Aktan's topic, Turkish-Armenian Dialogue: Challenges and Prospects, rolled up into one the most developed strands of denial. Feigning great empathy for the Armenians and for their losses, he carefully created a Balkan model of Armenian action in the Ottoman Empire, by which the Armenians aspired to independence with the support of the external powers. He then proceeded to spin a web of deception regarding both the historical and legal aspects of the Armenian Question. Since the Armenians quite naturally sought independence, as every people wishes to live independently, they cast themselves into the status of a political party. And because, as a whole, the Armenian element in the Ottoman Empire was transformed into a political movement, there is no way to maintain that it was subjected to genocide, because the U.N. Genocide Convention pertains to racial, religious, ethnical, and national groups, as such. Since measures taken against political parties and groups do not meet the legal definition of genocide as defined by the U.N. Convention, therefore the sad fate of the Armenians must be excluded from being considered a genocide. And Aktam did not fail to repeat the relativization noted by Professor Hovannisian when he pointed out that as many as a hundred so-called genocides had occurred during the twentieth century, not the least of which were the repeated genocidal massacres and forced expulsions of Turkic Muslim elements from lands passing under the control of Christian powers. SKIRTING THE TOPIC OF THE DAY What was most disconcerting in all of this was that Turkish deniers had been given most of the day to discuss almost everything except the subject of the roundtable dealing with legislative affirmation of the Armenian Genocide. Secondly, after having sat politely and quietly throughout the day without the interjections the day without the interjections frequently heard from the denier side, Professor Richard Hovannisian asked to be recognized to make a concluding statement about the conference, how it had started, and where it had led. To his amazement and consternation, the Director of the Danish Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, who was chairing the final session, denied him the opportunity to give his assessment, even though Hovannisian had submitted his request to speak in a timely fashion and made a final plea to be given two minutes. The conference was summarily closed before Dr. Hovannisian could draw attention to how the gathering had changed from its planning stages to the present and how, despite all the negative aspects that had been demonstrated during the course of that day, it had nonetheless been instructional inasmuch as the Turkish officials had predictably reiterated, point by point, the arguments that Hovannisian had outlined in his own presentation. He was also denied the opportunity to thank Dr. Markusen for a well-intended initiative and to express the hope that the experience of this conference would make the organizers more cognizant of the pitfalls and even audacity to attempt to hijack such events by the forces of denial. That the Turkish officials had been present in large measure to appeal to their own constituencies was demonstrated by the reports immediately appearing in the Turkish press and the swift series of articles by Mr. Aktam in which he gives his own version of the conference and the role of the Turkish participants in countering the false claims of genocide, thanks to the alertness and efforts of the Turkish Embassy in Copenhagen. One may conclude from all that was said and done that if Ambassador Aktam is representative of those Turkish officials who claim to be advocates of Armenian-Turkish friendship and normalization of relations, then there are many rows to hoe before any positive results can realistically be anticipated.","Hovannisian, Vartiter Kotcholosian",Armenian Reporter International,2002-06-08,1
"Vahakn N. Dadrian, The Armenian Question and the Wartime Fate of the Armenians As Documented by the Officials of the Ottoman Empire's World War I Allies: Germany and Austria-Hungary, in International Journal of Middle East Studies. Vol. 34 No. 1. February 2002. Vahakn Dadrian's recent article is just nineteen printed pages but it has the explosive impact of an expertly written massive book. Dr. Dadrian jumps right in and immediately takes Bernard Lewis, the Genocide denier, head on. Placing the noted Middle East historian Lewis in the camp that argues that there was no genocide for the usual shop-worn reasons. Dr. Dadrian asks which side is right-the one that argues that there was a genocide, or the opposition that denies it? Then he asks the important question: why? One can argue with Dr. Dadrian's expressed opinion. The essence of this work is hard data extracted from the archives of Imperial Germany and Imperial Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire's hard-core allies. In order to dismiss these revelations as inconclusive or fallacious, one has to decide that the archives written by the Ottoman allies were lies. But, as Dr. Dadrian writes, these messages were classified, secret, and top secret, not intended for the eyes of anyone except high officials in the German and Austria-Hungary hierarchy. Thus, if one were to call these fabrications, the person is simply stating that he/she refuses to accept hard data. On November 16, 1915, in a report to the German chancellor from Aleppo, Consul Walter Roessler wrote, I do not intend to frame my reports in such a way that I may be favoring one or the other party. Rather, I consider it my duty to present to you the description of things which have occurred in my district and which I consider to be the truth. Consul Roessler did not write from hearsay, he was on the ground. In reaction to the Turkish charge that Armenians were massacring Turks in Urfa, a city in Roessler's district, he dismissed the fabrications with one word: Invented. Consul Roessler's comments are much too long and extensive to include in this article, but one other from him is worthwhile. We have all read the allegations that Armenians were rebelling and were traitors. What Bernard Lewis and his ilk would have preferred is that, whenever possible, Armenians should have refused to defend themselves and that loyal citizens have an obligation to sit back and allow themselves and their loved ones to be butchered, raped, and their possessions stolen. The Consul dismissed the Turkish allegations as inflammatory and stupid. In several dispatches he reported that conscripts from Zeitun, as an example, were ill fed, mistreated, tormented, and women [Armenian] were molested. The German stated that the Armenians had to endure atrocities because the instigators [Turks] are continuing to instigate. Zeitun is one of the locales that the current deniers allege was in rebellion against the Ottoman authorities. Erzurum's Vice Consul Scheubner Richter reported on May 15, 1915 that the general treatment of the Armenian population was provocation, in that the Armenians were being agitated since the war began through harsh methods and that the cetes and the police have been simply challenging the Armenian people through their provocative conduct. He went on to inform the German chancellor that the Armenians will be provoked to acts of self-defense. The resulting disorders will then be presented to the outside world in an embellished form to serve as a pretext for deportations. Once underway, they will be attacked by the Kurds and Turkish brigands and some gendarmes, who will be incited by the CUP for this purpose, and murdered. Major General Otto von Lossow, German plenipotentiary in Turkey and military attaché, wrote a comprehensive report to the German chancellor. He stated in the report about the the Turkish policy of exterminating the Armenians and added, Wherever possible, the Armenians are being aroused, provoked in the hope of thereby securing a pretext for new assaults on them. On November 12, 1915, German Foreign Minister Gottleib von Jagow lamented about the Ottoman's policy of exterminating Armenians. German Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg denounced the policy of annihilation to solve the Armenian Question. Between June 1915-October 1918, four German ambassadors characterized the anti-Armenian measures as annihilation. After meeting with Talat, Johann Pallavicini, Austria-Hungary's ambassador, informed the homeland that the Ottomans solved the Armenian Questions through scandalous measures. His deputy also had a meeting with Talat in September 1915 and reported that there were no more Armenians in Erzurum and included that it had been enforced with unheard-of horrors that are being inflicted on Armenians and that the annihilation of the Armenian race is all but achieved. From April 20-May 17, 1915 the Vanetsis defended themselves. It served as a catalyst for the plan to exterminate the Armenians. Was this rebellion? Not according to Vice Marshal Pomiankowski, who labeled the Armenian defense of their lives as an act of despair. Alexandrette's Vice-Consul Hoffman stated that considering all that the Armenians endured, it is not surprising that Van Armenians rose up. None other than the Turkish Governor Cevet admitted, Ittihad [CUP] was underhadedly instigating the [Muslim] people, prodding them to hurl themselves upon the Armenians. He added that the Muslims were exterminating a guiltless and innocent people. Another claim by deniers is that the Ottoman Army had nothing to do with the deportations. But, according to the Turkish historian Yusaf Hikmet Bayur, the CUP leaders drifted to the idea that the problems should be settled through the use of the army. Dr. Dadrian shows the involvement of Generals Mahmud Kamil, Halil (Kut), Seyfi, Fahri, Nureddin, Mehmed Vehip, Col. Fuat Balkan and a host of other officers. In a scholarly and methodical manner, Dr. Dadrian simply obliterates the denier arguments that the measures taken against the Armenians were justified because of the conditions of an embattled empire. The last sentence written in the article by this scholar is: By any standard definition, this was an act of genocide. What Dr. Dadrian used was not written by Armenians intent upon getting lands back from Turkey via reparations; the quotes in the article are not from radical Armenians seeking revenge. Germans, Ottoman allies who witnessed the unfolding genocide, crafted the devastating documents. These German witnesses had no particular love for the Armenians. Vahakn Dadrian used a graceful style in recording what he found. With this evidence on hand, the Germans need to evaluate the reasons why their government is not courageous enough to publicly accept what their forebears documented as eyewitnesses and call what happened in 1915 as it was: GENOCIDE. This is one article that belongs in the libraries of all who have an interest in this subject. The six pages of endnotes that cite the various quotes are by themselves invaluable for researchers. This is another monumental piece of work by a master scholar. The article is available from the Zoryan Institute, 255 Duncan Mill Rd., Ste. 310, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M3B 3H9.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2002-05-25,1
"Four generations joined hands April 20 in downtown Lowell to pay tribute to martyrs and applaud survivors during an 87th-anniversary commemoration of the Armenian Genocide. The pan-Armenian observance was sponsored by the Armenian National Committee of Merrimack Valley, joined by a gathering of other organizations and churches. Massachusetts State Senator Peter J. Koutoujian of Newton outlined the repeated invasions and occupations throughout the ages leading to 1915, pointing to Armenia's rebirth and cultural identity as enduring principles. We have emerged from the trials of the past as Armenians always have - preserving our community and our values, he said. Part of this preservation means helping Armenia today. Senator Koutoujian, named by his colleagues as state legislator of the year, called for elected officials to assist Armenia with foreign aid and diplomatic support. We must lend our knowledge and expertise as Armenia continues to modernize its economy and strengthen its democratic institutions, he added. Regional stability is in America's national interest as well. The day began with a procession through downtown Lowell, Veterans honor guard. The Lowell Post is observing its 50th anniversary this year. Mistress of ceremonies Pearl Bargamian Teague welcomed the gathering with a brief but appropriate message. Massachusetts State Senator Steven Panagiotakos of Lowell likened the atrocities of 1915 to the recent terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 as a systematic approach to brutality against mankind. Homicide bombers are now being called martyrs by the Muslim faith, he criticized. It's a true disgrace. The world must teach its young the difference between right and wrong, or own up to it. The city's first Cambodian elected official, City Councilor Rithy Uong, pointed to the Killing fields as a similar tragedy that befell the population of his native country. Newly elected Mayor Rita Mercier described her city's Armenian population as one which laid the groundwork toward prosperity during the industrial revolution. She then issued a proclamation and presided over a flag-raising ceremony at City Hall. Turkey, to this day, denies the genocide, she said. Look into the faces of the survivors and there lies your answer. Mayor Mercier recognized Boghos Shamshoyian, the city's last remaining survivor, who was honored earlier in the week by the City Council. One of the more spirited messages was brought forth by Mark Juknavorian, a Methuen High School sophomore, representing the Armenian Church Youth Organization of America (ACYOA). Even though 87 painful years have seen the coming of four generations, young Armenians look to organizations such as the ACYOA and AYF as being critical vehicles to maintain our ethnic identity, he said. Please pray that the Armenian spirit fills the souls of young Armenians as well as future generations everywhere throughout the world so that we never forget the suffering and martyrdom of our forefathers and be guided by their sacred memory. The Armenian and American national anthems were led by John Magarian, a member of the Lowell Opera Company. A reception followed under the direction of the Lowell Armenian Relief Society and Sts.

"A few months ago, when Hamazkayin Toronto contacted me to review, as part of a series of literary events, a recent work by an Armenian writer, I was more than happy to oblige. As a graduate student, reading is all I do. When told the book would be a collection of short stories, I was doubly pleased, as my research and teaching responsibilities afford little time for leisure reading. You can perhaps imagine my surprise (and forgive my hesitation) at being handed, instead, a rather thick and heavy tome called A Summer Without Dawn by Agop Hacikyan and Jean-Yves Soucy. While the wonderful reviews on its dust jacket piqued my interest, its length (running over 500 pages) and its historical backdrop (the genocide of 1915) made me apprehensive. As for many Armenians of my generation, the genocide is an uneasy topic for me. Born and raised in the Diaspora, thoroughly immersed in North American society, the genocide remained separated by what seemed an unbridgeable distance, an existential gap that frustrated all attempts to draw meaning from this momentous episode in the modern history of Armenia. As such, the genocide has engendered various conflicting emotions, ranging from shame (at not caring enough) to frustration (at the lack of international recognition) to horror (watching the film adaptation of Franz Werfel's Forty Days of Musa Dagh remains one of the most harrowing memories of my youth.) I have thus consciously (and perhaps unconsciously) avoided it for much of my life. Sensitive to war and violence, I relegated it to the background, treating it as another historical fact (with all the requisite dates and statistics), discussing it largely at the behest of odar friends. And so when asked, a few years shy of thirty, to read a novel set against the events of 1915, I steadied myself to plough through what I thought was certain to be a sorrowful experience. How wrong I was. Despite its backdrop, A Summer Without Dawn is not dedicated (as I had imprudently assumed) to a solemn recounting of history. Instead, it is an adventure, an extraordinary novel that gets under your skin, seizes your imagination, and stubbornly refuses to leave you be until you have turned every page and read each word. Ignoring social obligations, freeing time where possible, I consumed it steadily over a few nights, careful not to miss any detail, captivated by the incredible story of the Balian family - Vartan, Maro, and young Tomas - and their improbable escape from the clutches of oblivion. At the outset of the novel, Vartan Balian, an intellectual, pharmacist, and reserve medical officer in the Sultan's army, is sentenced to death for writing articles criticizing the new Young Turk government. Though he escapes the gallows, he faces a fate far worse: the possibility of never finding his wife and son, who are sent on a vast deportation march with tens of thousands of others. The resulting story spans several years and locales. From the cosmopolitan Aleppo to the deserts of Syria, each setting shines with authenticity, no doubt resulting from Hacikyan's roots in Istanbul, Turkey. It is epic storytelling at its finest, filled with innumerable twists and unexpected adventures. As an Armenian reader, it was easy to relate to figures such as Captain Armen, young Tomas' kind godfather who would escort him to church, or Azniv Hanim, Maro's stubborn and opinionated mother who insisted on preserving her matriarchal dominance while challenged by an extremely capable daughter. Time and again there are familiar settings, such as the impromptu meeting held by the Armenian community leaders on the eve of the deportation order, each espousing opinions in an unstructured setting that reminded me of many joghovs I have taken part in at the community center. What impressed me most, though, was neither the novel's rich detail nor the familiarity of some of its characters or situation, but rather the keen sensitivity toward the subject matter. The deportations are afforded the reverence they deserve, while the treatment of the Turkish people is neither straightforward nor stereotypical. In fact, the range of Armenian-Turkish relationships was an element I found especially pleasing, lending integrity to the narrative. Characters such as Ibrahim Alizade, the Turkish colonel who gives his life so that Vartan may escape the gallows, or the outlaw Kurds who aid Vartan during his escape from prison, color the entire book, helping the Armenian reader overcome the rigid dichotomy of 'us' vs. 'them'. In this regard, Riza Bey (the Turkish governor of Ayntab) is perhaps the most fascinating character in the novel. As both opportunist and sympathizer, the ambivalence he engenders in the reader is palpable from the outset; during the atrocious deportation marches, he rescues Maro (and Tomas) from certain death for the sole reason of adding her to his harem, while simultaneously revealing an underlying ethical conscience: What he had seen happening in this region during the past week haunted him. All that cruelty! All those needless deaths! And he was partly responsible. It was one thing to transmit orders from the capital to the governors and mayors, to decide which towns to evacuate, to trace the routes on paper; it was quite another to see with his own eyes the effect of his measures on human beings! It is precisely this even-handed approach that renders the reading experience not simply edifying but also therapeutic. By going beyond 'good' and 'evil', Hacikyan and Soucy inject a human element to the narrative, creating complexity and ambiguity where one might expect unequivocal moral posturing. The Balian family's plight, the web of relationships that are forged during their separation, the jumble of human emotions and psychological trials that plague them all ring true and find resonance in the reader. In this sense, A Summer Without Dawn is an uplifting book, its all-too- human characters - whether Armenian or Turkish. Christian or Muslim - recognizable and relatable. By revealing the strength of the human spirit and the remarkable ability for humans to cooperate and commiserate in troubling circumstances, A Summer Without Dawn is more than a seductive page-turner; its complex layers become a fertile ground in which the reader can nurture a dialectical experience with a distant time and an unthinkable horror, humanizing an episode in our history that may otherwise remain outside our grasp.","Sarkissian, Hagop",Armenian Reporter International,2002-04-27,1
"The Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople's longstanding role in pursuing and developing global inter-religious dialogue, and its continuous efforts to promote understanding and solidarity between members of different faiths, was the theme during His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew's second official visit to the United States as spiritual leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians. While in Washington, DC the Ecumenical Patriarch met with President George W. Bush at the White House and US Secretary of State Colin Powell at the Department of State. During his meetings with both men, His All Holiness also emp???asized the need to reopen the Patriarchal School of Theology at Halki, which was forcibly Shut???own by the Turkish Government in 1971. For the duration of his 6-day visit to Washington, Boston and New York, the Patriarch was accompanied by Archbishop Leo of Carelia and All Finland, Metropolitan Gennadios of Italy, Metro-polit??? Apostolos of Moschonision. The Patriarch and ???entourage arrived at Andrews Air Force Base on March 4. He was welcomed by Archbishop Demetrios, Lawrence Dunham, Assistant Chief of Protocol for the Department of State, Senator Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Maryland), Andrew Natsios, Administrator for the US Agency for International Development (who welcomed the Ecumenical Patriarch on behalf of President Bush), Michael Jaharis, Vice Chairman of the Archdiocesan Council, Dr. Anthony Limberakis, National Commander of the Order of Saint Andrew - Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, Andrew Banis, Supreme President of the Order of AHEPA, and area clergy, laity and their families. During a 40-minute meeting with President George W. Bush on March 5, the Patriarch briefed the President on his recent visit to Iran on January 11-15, an earlier trip to Bahrain and possible future travels to other Moslem nations. The President told me that much hatred exists there, and that he will continue his efforts until he is able to bring peace there and world-wide, His All Holiness said. The Patriarch also briefed the President about a major interfaith conference held in Brussels, Belgium this past December. Organized by the Patriarch, in concert with European Commission President Romano Prodi, the conference brought together over 80 Christian, Muslim and Jewish leaders to promote dialogue and peaceful coexistence among the faithful of all religions. Stressing the special role of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in coordinating pan-Orthodox concerns worldwide - a role that, as His All Holiness noted, the American President recognized it even before - the Patriarch said that he requested the President's support in securing freedom of action, so that the Ecumenical Patriarchate can fulfill its sacred mission. The Patriarch also urged Mr. Bush to support the reopening of Halki Seminary. President Bush's emphatic response was that it is the United States' position to protect minority rights all over the world. The Greek American community was also a topic of their discussion: We discussed the Greek community in the United States, which is an inseparable part of both the American nation and society and of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. That is why whatever happens with the Patriarchate reflects on the Greek American community and on our Church here, which is justifiably concerned with the stability of the Ecumenical Patriarchate as its Mother Church, the Patriarch said. REAL LOVE His Eminence Archbishop Demetrios of America also joined His All Holiness and the President at the Oval Office. The Archbishop said that President Bush displayed real love and genuine appreciation for what the Ecumenical Patriarch does to help foster universal peace and friendship. Earlier that day, the Patriarch also met with US Secretary of State Colin Powell. Secretary Powell and I discussed the issues of the current inter-religious dialogue as well as religious freedoms, and in that context, we brought up the issue of the Halki Theological Seminary, His All Holiness said, adding that Mr. Powell promised to assist in the efforts to reopen Halki, as he believes in its vital role for the Patriarchate's present and future. In fact, the State Department's annual Report on Human Rights in Turkey, which was released the day before the Patriarch's meeting with Mr. Bush, points out that the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul consistently has expressed interest in reopening its seminary on the island of Halki in the Sea of Marmara. The seminary has been closed since 1971, when the State (Turkey) nationalized most private institutions of higher learning. Under existing restrictions, including a citizenship requirement, religious communities remain unable to train new clergy. His All Holiness noted that Mr. Powell was familiar with the Bosporus Declaration (a 1994 interfaith communiqué asserting that violence in the name of religion is an act against religion) and the 2001 Brussels Declaration. He was informed of, and referred specifically to, those texts, the Patriarch said, adding that Secretary Powell expressed admiration and great esteem for the activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The Patriarch and Mr. Powell also discussed the dwindling of the Christian population in the Holy Lands and agreed that it is a result of the general strife in the Middle East. The Christian shrines in the Middle East should not, under any circumstances, end up as mere museums. Christianity was born in those lands and is entitled to live there, His All Holiness stressed, exhorting the US Government to help stem the exodus of the Christians from the Holy Land and the Middle East. That same day, the Patriarch also met with the Ambassador of Turkey to the United States, Osman Faruk Logloglu, who hosted a luncheon in honor of His All Holiness. In the evening, a reception and dinner was hosted by Mr. Natsios at the Library of Congress. His All Holiness ended his 2-day visit to Washington by meeting, at their request, the Archbishops of the Roman Catholic Church of Washington and Baltimore, Theodore Cardinal McCarrick and William Cardinal Keeler, and Archbishop Gabriel Montalvo, Apostolic Nuncio and Director of Offices of United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, to whom the Patriarch stressed that we as Christians are charged by God himself to restore our unity, so that the world will believe in the divine mission of the Church of Christ. Meetings such as ours contribute to the achievement of God-desired unity, even though the road that lies before us is a long one. A meeting with the professors, students seminarians and families at Hellenic College/Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology, an emotional visit to the Diocese of Boston's Philoxenia House, a 2-day meeting with the Holy Eparchial Synod of America, and a dinner commemorating the 80th anniversary of the Archdiocese and the 65th anniversary of Holy Cross highlighted the pastoral visit of His All Holiness to Boston on March 6-8. Noting that the unity of the flock of the Church in America has been completely restored, His All Holiness stressed that the time has come to turn away from self absorption and to offer ourselves to all of those who fervently desire the truth. Addressing more than 250 attendees at the anniversary dinner Patriarch Bartholomew told his audience that looking upon the future, we realize that our aim should be to further the mission of our Orthodox Church in the contemporary world. SUBMIT PROPOSALS Earlier, he chaired a meeting of the Holy Eparchial Synod, during which he stressed the need to review the course of the Church in America. He encouraged the American-based bishops, who shoulder the lofty and heavy responsibility of keeping the unity of the Orthodox Omogeneia intact and the duty to guide them to the best possible solutions, to study the existing condition of the Church in America and submit proposals for its future to the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Speaking in diagnostic terms, he Patriarch said that Church in America needs to shift direction and charged those who are responsible for guarding and disseminating the faith in America find the way to constructively change course. He also suggested that the Greek American community's actions are being watched by, and will have a bearing on, the rest of its Orthodox Christian brethren in America. Let us turn our attention to the situation from which we started to the situation in which we are now and ask ourselves: what is our vision, and how are we going to achieve it? If we continue our tactics as we have done up to now, what would be the consequences? How will the Omogeneia and other Orthodox Christians in the United States react? What can we do, and what should we do, to push the issues in a specific direction, and what should that direction be? We should diagnose the development of the situation in the Holy Archdiocese of America and think about how we might constructively change it, His All Holiness said. Speaking to Seminarians, the Patriarch stressed the pressing need for the Patriarchate to remain in Constantinople because that way, it can better play its role, acting as a Christian droplet in a Moslem ocean. He also called on the students to become familiar with the rich and incomparable Greek language, and to safeguard their Hellenic heritage and traditions. During his visit to Philoxenia House, which was established in 1986 by Metropolitan Methodios of Aneon (presiding Bishop - Diocese of Boston) as an Orthodox home of hope for sick children, mainly from Greece and Cyprus, who come to Boston seeking medical treatment. The guests expressed their appreciation for what the Church is doing for them during very difficult times in their lives, and His All Holiness thanked Metropolitan Methodios for his God-pleasing efforts, worthy of all praise. While he was in Boston, the Patriarch stayed on campus and held meetings with the HC/HC Board of Trustees, the New England Clergy and Alumni Association, and toured the theological school's Archbishop Iakovos Library extensively. New York was the last stop of the Patriarch's 6-day visit to the United States. His All Holiness and his entourage arrived at LaGuardia Airport on March 8 for a 2-day visit which was highlighted by a meeting and paternal dialogue with the students of Saint Demetrios Cathedral in Astoria, a visit and a memorial service at Ground Zero, and the annual Archons Banquet honoring former President George and First Lady Barbara Bush (the parents of the current President - see related story on page 11). More than 500 Greek School students welcomed the Ecumenical Patriarch at the Saint Petros G. Petridis Cultural Center and listened carefully as he spoke to them about the significance of preserving their Hellenic and Orthodox Christian heritage and traditions. Afterwards, His All Holiness officiated during Vespers and conducted a Memorial Service for the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks. New York-New Jersey Port Authority Police officers and family members of victims of the attacks were among those who attended the service. Later in the evening, the Patriarch inaugurated a photographic exhibit, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew - Ten Years of Diakonia (Stewardship) - 1991-2001 by Nicholas Manginas, the patriarchal photographer, at the Onassis Cultural Center in Manhattan. More than 300 people attended the Onassion reception, as Archbishop Demetrios introduced the Patriarch. The appreciation for photographic displays is both easy and difficult because photography is both history and art, and one has to be both a historian and an artist in order to create such a wonderful exhibit, The Archbishop said. Art has three characteristics: power, elegance and eloquence, and His All Holiness certainly embodies all three characteristics, both in his travels and in his tireless efforts to advance the sacred mission of the Church. The Patriarch thanked the event's organizers and attendees and linked the exhibit's historical portrayal of his Patriarchy with an opportunity to share interpersonal communion with those present. We interpret and gratefully accept the organization of this photographic exhibit as an expression of love and honor, and as a display of recognition and respect for our Ecumenical Patriarchate...In the present exhibit, you may discover pieces of a mosaic, whose composition depends on history, and whose evaluation rests on the righteous judgment of God. It is a known fact that a picture reflects only part of a certain reality. It constitutes only a fragment of it; captures only a moment of it. It does not, therefore, convey its entire history. But it does provides proof of an event that took place. The constant progress in the field of photography, in combination with the artistic ability, style and sensitivity of the photographer, makes the partial approach to any event possible. What is more important, however, is interpersonal communion with one another. We thus rejoice for our personal contact with you, who honor the Mother Church of Constantinople, as well as our Modesty, with your presence here this evening. We express our wholehearted gratitude to those who undertook the initiative for the organization of this exhibit...and we bestow upon all here present our fatherly wishes and patriarchal blessing and pray to the Lord our God to protect you, your homes, and this Country, and to lead you into all goodness. Amen, His All Holiness said. On March 9, the Patriarch presided over a Divine Liturgy and Trisagion service for the victims of 9/11 at Saint Barbara's Church in Manhattan and headed to the ruins of the World Trade Center for a 6-month Memorial service, imploring all nations to refrain from sponsoring terrorism as part of his plea for peaceful co-existence throughout the world. TERRORISM MULTIPLIES EVIL We are given the opportunity, today, to make an appeal to the international community, and to those in particular who think that they are not treated with justice, whether this is true or not. We ask of all nations to abstain from employing terrorism. Terrorist acts multiply evil and perpetuate the immoral cycle of reciprocating evil with evil. This outcome contradicts spiritual law, according to which truth conquers evil, His All Holiness said, characterizing the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a holocaust, a horrid and hideous crime. During a brief stop at the site where Saint Nicholas Church stood in the shadow of the Twin Towers six months beforehand, the Patriarch noted that We came to pay our respects to the souls of those so tragically departed and to pray for the repose of their souls. We came also to pray that God will bring peace, love, inspiration and enlightenment to all of humankind so that such tragic events and hideous acts will never again be repeated. That evening, His All Holiness presided over the Archons Banquent and personally bestowed the Patriarch Athenagoras Humanitarian Award to Mr. and Mrs. Bush. His All Holiness concluded his visit to America by celebrating a Patriarchal Divine Liturgy at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity on March 10, bestowing the offikion of Archon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate to 40 new members of the Order of Saint Andrew, defenders of the Ecumenical Patriarchate.

"On April 4, 2002 in Ankara, Turkey, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit accused Israel of committing genocide against the Palestinians [See text of article With a World, Israeli-Turkish Strain Surfaces by Douglas Frantz in the International News section of this issue - ed.]. He did not mince words or try to be politically correct to assuage a nation with which Turkey is an ally. He plainly stated, Not only Arafat, but all of the Palestinian state is being destroyed step by step. In front of the world's eyes, genocide is being committed. The Sharon administration has chosen the path of occupation and war instead of peace and dialogue. As we all know, the government in Israel has genuflected to Turkey by not affirming the Armenian Genocide in contravention of the conclusions of its renowned genocide scholars. Just a few days ago. The Jerusalem Post continued to be sensitive to Turkey but ignored the feelings of Armenians and circumvented the truth by qualifying a reference to the Genocide with the word alleged. The most recent diplomatic incident occurred when Israel's Ambassador to Georgia and Armenia Rivka Cohen denied the Genocide and Israel supported her denials as it had with Shimon Peres. The loyalty from Israel to Turkey with regard to genocide of the Armenians is well documented. There is no question that Ariel Sharon is not in favor of having peace with the Palestinians except on his own terms. The Israeli methods used against the Palestinians are way out of proportion and deserve the concomitantly with the condemnation of the Palestinian suicide bombers. However, nothing justifies murder, not by the suicide bombers and not by the Israelis. A CASE OF POT CALLING KETTLE BLACK But it boggles the mind to think that Turkey's prime minister has the audacity to lecture and condemn, even in a whisper, their Israeli ally. This is the same prime minister who orchestrated the invasion of Cyprus and helped to cleanse the northern region of no-Turkish occupants. This is the same man who threatens to annex the Turkish zone of Cyprus if the European Union accepts the unoccupied Cyprus Republic as a member. Unless it has all been a Hollywood movie, Turkey used terrorism as an excuse to kill thousands of Kurds. Hundreds of Kurdish villages have been cleared of their occupants, their fields have been razed and their livestock plundered or slaughtered. Kurdish parliamentarians have been stripped of their immunity and imprisoned for attempting to defend their people and to put a stop to the brutality. No question, the PKK were/are terrorists, but are they more inhumane in the selection of some of their targeted people than the suicide bombers? All of this came under the permiership of Mr. Ecevit. In fact, one could make a case that the Israelis learned from their allies. But the rest of the world must share some of the blame of what is happening today in Palestine because, as long as Turkey called its murder and deportations of the Kurds justified acts against terrorists, why shouldn't Sharon try the same thing? The world must also share the blame for another problem. Few states objected to the continual excursions across Iraq's borders by the Turkish military to kill Kurds. Western states, Russia, China, and others continued to sell military hardware to Turkey. For public consumption, the military sales to Turkey were again justified as a means to prevent the terrorists from using Iraq as a safe haven. In reality, it was no more than the defense industry's selfish pursuit of profits. Now Mr. Sharon has taken his cue from Turkey. If they can pursue terrorists across a border using weapons purchased from Western states, Israel can do the same. There is one major difference in these lessons learned from the Turks. Israel betrayed its integrity by denying the Armenian Genocide to keep Ankara happy, while Turkey betrayed Israel by calling its attack upon the Palestinians genocide. The condemnation of Israel by Ecevit is interesting. One wonders if Turkey's National Security Council (NSC) knew what the prime minister was going to say. Unless Turkey's politicians are getting braver, they normally do not attempt to buck the military. We must remember that Ecevit has spent some time under house arrest by order of the military in the past. Turkey's military does not take kindly to civilians, even if it is the prime minister, making noise that could destroy a powerful Military alliance they have developed with the Israel military. It is likely that the NSC, dominated by the generals, knew the contents of Ecevit's comments beforehand. If he did overstep the authority that the generals allow him to have, the world will find a quick denial issued in a few days, stating that he never said Israel committed genocide. And since Turkish newspapers reported the accusation, they will admit that it was a mistake on the part of some reporter. In a pseudo-democracy Like Turkey, only certain subjects are allowed free expression and freedom of speech. Straying onto with the generals' turf is forbidden. REP. LANTOS PULLING HIS HAIR OUT Rep. Tom Lantos, the great humanitarian from San Francisco, another denier of the Genocide, must be pulling out what little hair he has left. One of his beloved accused another of his beloved's, Israel, of genocide. It is not surprising that Mr. Lantos, the champion of human rights, has been very noticeable by his silence about Israel's brutality, except to support the terrorists label attached to the Palestinians. The scramble by Foggy Bottom bureaucrats to find answers must have been frantic. How could Turkey, whom they have protected all these years from the terrible onslaughts of the Armenian and Greek lobbies, have called another one of their favorites genocidal? And now how can the State Department recommend giving military aid to Turkey to modernize 170 tanks at $668 million for a nation it has just accused of genocide? Won't that money be used to commit further genocide? The answer is simple and Israel is learning it the hard way. When a nation commits genocide and is unrepentant like Turkey, it sees in others its own evils. Israel supported Turkey to deny the Genocide, and in turn Ankara dropped the hammer on Israel. If so-called genocide is an insult to all of the Turkish people, as claimed by the Turkish official, doesn't an accusation of genocide against Israel insult its citizens? Israel might begin to understand that Turkey has been xenophobic for years, and what applies to its people does not impact upon Israel. Further, Turkey is not sure that it will ever get into the EU, particularly if the Cyprus issue is not resolved to everyone's satisfaction. Therefore, Turkey is not burning all of its bridges behind it. If the EU falls out, and for numerous reasons it is a possibility, it does not want to cement the animosity of the Arab world by siding with its ally Israel on the Palestinian issue. Turkey cannot survive by itself and with only the U.S. They know it, so it is no big matter to sell Israel down the drain to take care of its own perceived interests. Get smart, Israel; Turkish soldiers will climb into a foxhole with Israeli soldiers to fight against a Muslim nation only if it suits Turkey's own purposes and not before. Israel, you reap what you sow!","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2002-04-20,1
"Following a long and extensive review by specialists and their subsequent recommendation for publication, the editors of the International Journal of Middle East Studies (IJMES) have just published in their February 2002 issue an article by Prof. Vahakn Dadrian, Director of Genocide Research at the Zoryan Institute, according to an announcement from said institute. Titled The Armenian Question and the Wartime Fate of the Armenians as Documented by the Officials of the Ottoman Empire's World War I Allies: Germany and Austro-Hungary, this article appears in the official publication of the large Middle East Studies Association. This latest study by Dadrian will reach numerous Turkish historians who are members of that association, and currently are teaching in universities throughout North America, Europe, and especially in Turkey. IJMES is published by the august Cambridge University Press, and is a leading and most prestigious journal in its field. Following an elaborate and methodical presentation of a large body of official German and Austrian documents, Prof. Dadrian concludes, By any standard of definition, [the wartime fate of the Armenians involved] an act of genocide. In his introduction, Dadrian argues that, owing to the politicization of this field, Armenian and Ottoman Turkish sources have been unnecessarily rendered controversial. Therefore, it is best to rely on sources found in the state archives of Imperial Germany and Imperial Austro-Hungary, the staunch military allies of the Ottoman Empire during World War I. These documents are invaluable, argues Dadrian, not only because they emanate from sources that are identified with the perpetrator camp, but mainly because they were not intended for public consumption but rather for internal use. The study comprises the following main themes: The Portents of the Unfolding Armenian Question; The Kurdish Factor; The Exacerbation of the Armenian Reform Issue in the Pre-war Years and the Rudiments of Premeditation; World War I as a Major Catalyst and the Issue of Armenian Culpability; The Antinomic Nature of the Provocation Argument; The Resolution of the Armenian Question Through the Wholesale Liquidation of the Armenians; The Instruments of Supervision and Implementation; Conclusion. The research is supported and corroborated by 115 endnotes, some of them very extensive, and primarily involve German and Austrian archival material. To illustrate the importance and accuracy of the first-hand accounts of the high-ranking officials of these two empires who were stationed in the interior of Turkey, especially in such centers of deportation and massacre as Trabzon, Erzurum, Adana and Aleppo, Dadrian provides the original German texts. This research is the product of some two dozen trips to such archival centers as Bonn, Potsdam, Freiburg im Breisgau in Germany, and Vienna, Austria over the last twenty years. In addition to the massive use of German language documents, the study contains several references to official French documents, especially the reports of veteran French ambassador to Turkey, Paul Cambon. From such documents we learn, for example, that already during the 1894-1896 Sultan Abdul Hamit-era massacres, Ottoman authorities, according to Cambon, were contemplating the deportation of the Armenians en masse to Mesopotamia (p.63). Equally important are the key Ottoman documents Dadrian utilizes in his conclusion, especially those provided by Third Army Commander Vehib Pasha and Aleppo's governor-general Mehmed Celal. Vehib, a Young Turk Ittihadist himself, in his deposition at the Turkish Military Tribunal, explicitly stated that the Armenians were subjected to a centrally organized mass murder, the architects of which were the members of Ittihad's Central Committee. Moreover, he unequivocally declared that the entire campaign of wholesale extermination was premeditated (kasden) and was carried out under the supervision of the government (hükümetin tahti altinda). Finally, Vehib stresses the fact that the planned mass murder was accompanied by the pillage and plunder of the goods and properties of the Armenians (Ermenilerin katl ve imhasi ve mallarinin yagma ve gasbi) (p.77). Dadrian underscores a fundamental fact: the plan to exterminate the Armenians had very little to do with isolated instances of wartime acts of Armenian espionage, sedition, disloyalty or subversion, but rather with a pre-war Ittihadist decision to resolve, at the first opportunity, once and for all, the troublesome Armenian Question that had plagued the Ottoman Empire for decades. Thus, the Armenian Reforms issue is placed at the center of the Turko-Armenian conflict. This issue assumed its most grave character in the wake of the first Balkan War, at the end of which the Turks had lost most of the European portion of their empire, and became severely fearful about losing the eastern provinces to the Armenians, who were agitating for sweeping reforms in those provinces. In this connection, Dadrian uncovers a remarkable historical fact. Already in 1856, six-time Grand Vizier Koca Mustafa Reshad had warned the Sultan that should be yield to European pressures and grant the non-Muslims equality, there would inevitably erupt a huge massacre (bir mukatele-i azîme). He did not believe that the non-Muslims, preordained to be dominated (milleti mahkûme) could be the equals of the Muslim overlords (milleti hâkime). A similar view was expressed in 1915 by Ziya Gökalp, the chief Ittihadist ideologue. He declared that Islam mandated domination, that the non-Muslims could never be the equals of the Muslims unless they converted and became Muslims. Speaking of these reforms meant to provide equality for the non-Muslims, Dadrian produces evidence showing that Cemal Pasha, member of the Young Turk triumvirate, warned the Armenians during the period marked by agitation for reforms, 1912-1913, that should the Armenians succeed in securing such reforms, at least 300,000 Armenians were likely to be massacred by the Muslims in the eastern provinces for which reforms were being sought. The most trenchant feature of this article is the presentation of overwhelming evidence of German corroboration of the charge of genocidal intent and genocidal outcome. Four consecutive German ambassadors consistently and emphatically informed their central government that, under the guise of deportation, the Turkish authorities were bent on wiping out the bulk of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire and that, in the end, they succeeded in this design. Given the present Turkish stance of denial regarding the Armenian Genocide, as well as the tacit support of this stance by other governments for political expediency, this powerful article and its irrefutable documentation effectively demolishes the hollow arguments of the deniers. It is indeed bound to pave the way for academics and politicians alike to embrace the legitimacy of the argument that the Armenians were indeed victims of the first major genocide of the twentieth century at the hands of the Ottoman Turks.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-03-23,1
"The geopolitical isolation of Armenia, which is virtually surrounded by adversaries, has only grown worse since the events of 9/11. America's War on Terrorism quickly became, for example, a pretext for the US to partially end its Section 907 ban on aid to Azerbaijan. Congress, in its haste, conveniently overlooked the fact that Azerbaijan had long hosted Al Qaeda and other Islamic terror organizations, according to Congressional terrorism expert Yossef Bodansky. US aid to Azerbaijan, though ostensibly limited to aid against terrorism, constitutes a major setback for Armenia, as it will lead to an upgrading of the Azeri military, an expansion of US-Azeri relations, and less pressure on Azerbaijan to compromise on Karabagh. And the bad news does not stop there. TURKEY'S VALUE GROWS As Armenians, we recognize that Turkey's leadership shares none of the moral values of the civilized West and could not care less about the American deaths of 9/11. Even so, with the help of US propaganda, Turkey has managed to hoodwink a lot of people into thinking that it is the most anti-terrorist nation on earth. Turkey does, nevertheless, have certain assets: It is a member of NATO, has a US airbase at Incirlik, and is next door to two American foes, Iraq and Iran. In a future assault upon Iraq, Turkey will be a staging area for US forces and will hold a gun to the heads of northern Iraq's Kurds, lest the latter attempt to set up an independent Kurdistan. At the same time, Turkey may try to create an autonomous region in the Turcoman-populated, oil-rich regions of northern Iraq, something it had hoped for during the Gulf War. Turkey's greater importance after 9/11 in Western eyes means that Armenian issues vis-à-vis Turkey, such as Genocide denial and its blockade of Armenia, are less likely than ever to make headway. It also means more military aid for Turkey and huge amounts of cash - $16 billion from the International Monetary Fund at US urging - to bail it out of its latest economic crisis. AMERICA'S REGIONAL GOALS To understand the impact of 9/11 on Armenia, we must look at the State Department's long-standing, fundamental goals in the Caucasus and Central Asia. To prevent a resurgence of Russian imperialism after the collapse of the USSR, the State Department has, for 10 years, sought to ally itself with the countries of he Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan & Armenia) and Central Asia (Tajikistan, and Turkic-speaking Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan & Turkmenistan). A second American goal is to gain access to the region's sizeable oil and gas resources, the income from which can also lessen those countries' dependence on Russia. The US regards eastern Turkey as the friendliest route for oil and gas pipelines originating in oil-rich Azerbaijan and the Caspian area. If, moreover, you put a pencil on Turkey or any place to its west and draw a line to Azerbaijan and the Caspian region - but avoiding US rivals Russia and Iran - your pencil must cross Georgia or Armenia. That is why the State Department is so interested in poor Armenia and a basket case like Georgia. Of course, a Karabagh settlement would open the Azeri-Armenian border, the Turkey-Nakhichevan-Meghri-Azerbaijan pan-Turkish corridor, and maybe even the Turkish-Armenian border, and thus give the US a direct way in. But without peace in Karabagh, Georgia remains the only way into Azerbaijan and so is the region's linchpin in the eyes of Western policy-makers. THE TERRORISM EXCUSE The War on Terrorism, though a totally legitimate fight, is being used by the US as an excuse to achieve its goal of penetrating the Caucasus and Central Asia. As mentioned, 9/11 boosted Turkey's importance and all but ended sanctions on Azerbaijan. In addition, America hopes to stabilize Afghanistan enough to accommodate a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan. We know this because, in the late 1990's, the State Department encouraged Unocal, the US-based energy giant to negotiate with the Taliban to build such a pipeline. Ostensibly to fight terrorism, but in actuality to create a Turko-American sphere of influence and push not Russia, the US has since 9/11 gained over- flight and refueling rights in all eight countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia. In the last few months, thousands of American troops have been stationed in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, something that was previously unthinkable. American forces are now in Georgia to help battle Chechens and Al Qaeda terrorists in that country's northeast. In reality, the larger purpose is to shore up Georgia against continuing Russian pressure and push out Russian influence. As Georgia is Yerevan's only direct passageway to Russia, this imperils Armenia. In addition, as Muslim regions in the north Caucasus, such as Chechnya, try to expel Russia, this may further distance Russia from the Caucasus and its Armenian partner. But even if none of these US military deployments since 9/11 are permanent, it is clear that Moscow cannot or will not challenge a major American presence in its backyard. As a result, Armenia is being separated from Russia and surrounded by the unsavory US-sponsored alliance of Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. ARMENIA UNDER SIEGE Armenian foreign policy is based on complimentarity, meaning balanced between Russia and the West. Yerevan cultivates good relations with each, while not leaning too far in either direction so as to neither antagonize nor be taken for granted by either superpower. A cornerstone of Armenian policy is, of course, the support of Russia - as unreliable as it may be - against the common enemy: Turkey and pan-Turkism. Yet, since 9/11, Washington and Moscow have allegedly entered a period of cooperation in, for example, arms control and fighting Islamic terrorism. The real explanation, however, may be that Russia, though uncomfortable with US intrusion on its southern perimeter, is losing the superpower competition anyway and believes that it is prudent to cooperate with America, for instance in tapping the region's oil and gas. Recent events, therefore, present Yerevan with two problems. First, even if the American-Russia detente is an illusion, the US and Turkey are winning the regional battle, and even more so since 9/11, as explained above. Consequently, a Russia that is holding on by its fingernails in the Caucasus cannot be the guarantor of Armenian security that it once was. If, on the other hand, the American-Russian détente is genuine, such cooperation largely destroys the main reason for Russia's supporting Armenia: To keep pan-Turkism and the West out of Russia's sphere of influence. Either way, Armenia will find itself physically isolated from its traditional Russian ally and surrounded by an alliance - perhaps a soon-to-be NATO alliance - of the US, Turkey, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Iran would be Armenia's only outlet. Caught in the middle, but with the ability to span Eastern and Western cultures, Armenia would have little choice but to be a sort of regional economic middleman. Though it might prosper in some ways, Armenia would become a vassal state of the West and thus largely at the mercy of its two lethal, US-backed Turkish neighbors. ARMENIANS FIGHT BACK. The West and turkey have aggressive designs on the Caucasus and Central Asia, yet the north-south alliance of Russia, Armenia, and Iran has no similar designs on Turkey and the West. This imbalance means that, aside from Karabagh and close relations with Greece, Armenia's stance is mostly defensive and, therefore, may eventually succumb to repeated blows from the US-Turkish battering ram. Of course, the US has totally corrupted its policies in the region by partnering with Turkey, and unrepentant human rights violator. The outlook for Armenia and democracy is not encouraging unless, aided by like-minded friends, it pushes back against Turkish/Western hostility. There are a number of ways to do that, but they are not without risk or problems. Some may even prove unworkable. Hopefully, though, these suggestions can serve as a starting point for debate and action: * Confer more closely with Turkish Kurds in their struggle against repression. * Vigorously utilize the Armenians of Javahk and other regions of Georgia, which is turning into a de-facto enemy of Armenia. * Put together a legal and moral case against Turkey for restitution and reparations arising out of 1915-1923. * Work alongside the Diaspora to turn Armenia's Genocide policy, which now consists of little more than a few speeches, into a massive public drive against Turkey. Link the campaign to Turkey's multitude of human rights abuses. * Conduct an energetic campaign against Azerbaijan, focusing on its support of Al Qaeda terrorism and its guilt in starting the Karabagh conflict. * Assert rights to formerly Armenian-owned/occupied areas in eastern Turkey along the route of the proposed Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, the purpose being to cast a cloud over this supremely important Western project that unreasonably excludes Armenia. * Press claims against Germany and Turkey for using Armenian slave labor in constructing the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1915. * Look into claims against the American airbase at Incirlik which, says Genocide historian Hilmar Kaiser, may be illegally occupying the Bezdikian, and other Armenian property. * Indict Turkey in world forums for its destruction and desecration of thousands of Armenian churches and historical monuments. * Join the Diaspora in lawsuits against Turkey and other parties, such as that against New York Life over unpaid life insurance policies from 1915. * Use Jerusalem's Armenian Quarter, which is a major point of contention between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as a bargaining chip for vital Armenian issues elsewhere. Assist Jerusalem's passive Armenians in pressing for Genocide recognition in Israel and Palestine. Armenia and the Diaspora must together take bold and imaginative political action today if the Armenian nation is to avoid isolation and catastrophe.","Boyajian, David B",Armenian Reporter International,2002-03-16,1
"TOM McDonald has to live with one simple fact: If not for a scheduling change which went into effect on September 10, he would have been working on September 11. A member of Squad # 2 of the NYPD's Emergency Service Unit, in Harlem, McDonald probably would have been one of the first rescue workers to arrive at the Twin Towers that terrible day. As a result, McDonald also might have appeared in the chilling, controversial documentary set to air this Sunday night on CBS at 9 p.m. And if that were the case, there's a good chance McDonald would not have survived the attacks. Despite such sensitivity - not to mention the many friends and colleagues McDonald lost that terrible day - he said he'd like to see this Sunday's two-hour documentary, which captures the moments before the towers' collapse. The (ESU) guys we lost might be on film, McDonald told the Irish Voice, explaining why he might be tuning in. Me personally, I would like to see them. On the other hand, when it comes to the network broadcast, McDonald very much understands why families who suffered losses might not want to see it. It comes down to what the families want, the ex-Marine, who has visited troops in Afghanistan, added. It's hard to gauge exactly what the families of 9/11 victims want at this point. Yes, many have protested CBS's decision to go ahead with the documentary, which will air commercial free, and will be hosted by Robert DeNiro. Yet an informal survey of Irish Americans affected by the attacks also shows that some are looking forward to seeing loved ones performing heroic acts. Nevertheless, there is also significant concern that, in the end, for all their public relations work, CBS may still be exploiting the tragedy. I'm not saying I'm strongly against it or for it, said Father Brian Jordan, a close friend of beloved FDNY chaplain Father Mychal Judge. If they're going to do it though I hope it's tastefully done, not to try and evoke people's emotions for a buck. CBS has responded by saying the documentary - shot by French brothers Gedeon and Jules Naudet - contains virtually no graphic footage of injuries. It is, though, filled with four-letter words, according to early reports. (The film has been making firehouse rounds for months.) The Naudets happened to be downtown that day shooting a film about a rookie fire-fighter, and have said they decided not to shoot any gory imagery. Jules Naudet, who was in the lobby of the World Trade Center, said he saw two women on fire but instinctively kept his camera away. Nevertheless, some relatives of Sept. 11 victims have urged CBS not to show the documentary, based on the emotions which even heroic, or mundane, footage of perished loved ones could arouse. At one point, the film is said to show Father Judge silently praying as he surveys the scene. Minutes later, a still shot of rescue workers carrying Judge's lifeless body is shown. Despite such heart-wrenching scenes, some who've spoken to 9/11 victims' families said they understand it was inevitable that the film would be broadcast. I think it's a historic document, said Dennis Smith, whose highly-anticipated book Report From Ground Zero (Viking) hits stores March 18. They have to be sensitive to the needs of the families...and I think they have been. Smith compared the footage to the Zapruder home film of JFK's assassination. We do believe in free press and free speech, added Father Jordan, who's ministered daily at Ground Zero. If it's going to be shown (CBS has a) responsibility to make a well-produced commentary...free of bias and needless sentiment. I hope viewers see it and say: We appreciate what we have...we should count our blessings. Jordan also hopes the documentary does not stir up anti-Arab or-Muslim feelings. Father Jordan, however, illustrated the split which still exists amongst Irish New Yorkers, when asked if he planned to tune in. I have not decided yet, the Brooklyn native said.

"THE man who raped the girl at the center of Ireland's infamous X case, was jailed yesterday for kidnapping and sexually assaulting another teenager. In an extraordinary coincidence, the 52-year-old man was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison on the eve of the abortion referendum. Imposing the sentence in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday, Judge Pat McCartan called him a serious menace. Sean O'Brien, a separated father-of-three, with a last address at Swords, Co. Dublin, had denied the charges. O'Brien had been working as a taxi driver in 1999 when he picked up a 15-year-old girl in Donnycarney on the northside of the city. En route to her destination in the centre of town, he sexually assaulted her twice and detained her against her will in his car. The teenager had memorized O'Brien's badge number, which led to his arrest. A jury found Mr O'Brien guilty of two counts of sexual assault and one count of false imprisonment on Friday. Sentencing O'Brien, Judge McCartan said he wondered how he had ever been in a position to operate a taxi. He said he intended to ensure that this did not happen in the future. He jailed him for three-and-a-half years and disqualified him from driving for 10 years. His name will also be entered on the sexual offenders register. O'Brien had been released from jail in 1995 after serving three years for the rape of the 14-year-old X girl. He had been sentenced to 14 years but his sentence on that occasion was reduced because the judge felt he was not a danger to society. Speaking after the sentencing on Tuesday, the victim called a three-and-a-half year sentence disgraceful for a second offence. She said that she also wanted to know how he obtained a taxi licence. Fine Gael justice spokesman Alan Shatter said that it was of huge concern that a convicted sex offender could get a taxi license. Mr Shatter also said that the sentence Mr O'Brien received was too lenient. The sentencing is bound to have a negative affect on the Government's bid to win a Yes vote in the abortion referendum. The electorate is being asked to overturn the decision in the X case so that suicide will not be allowed as a legal ground for abortion in Ireland. In 1992, the Attorney General won an injunction stopping X - who was pregnant and suicidal - from travelling to Britain for an abortion after being raped by O'Brien. This was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court where the judges ruled that the Constitution allowed for abortion where there was a real and substantial risk to the mother's life through suicide. The latest referendum proposes to overturn that decision, outlawing suicide as grounds for abortion and introducing a 12-year sentence for women who have an abortion in Ireland or for anyone who helps them. Catholic bishops across the country called on their congregation to back the government's proposals and vote in favor of the amendment. The Muslim community also advocated a yes vote. However Ireland's Chief Rabbi, Rev Yaakov Pearlman, said the threat of suicide could be recognized in Jewish law as grounds for an abortion, and as such Jews would favor a No vote in the Referendum although abortion is forbidden by Jewish law. The Church of Ireland was also divided on the issue, although a number of senior churchmen have came out against the proposal. Politicians were divided. Supporters of the MEP Dana, said she was coming under pressure from the Catholic hierarchy to change her stance on the referendum. Former Fine Gael leader John Bruton called for a Yes vote and joined a group of lawyers in campaigning for the referendum, despite the fact that his party has led the No campaign. Doctors also differed and the No campaign received a significant last minute boost when 25 obstetricians and gynecologists called on the people to reject the proposal. But while politicians, lawyers, doctors and lobby groups argued the pros and cons of the referendum, 19 women per week are still going to England for abortions. In the last interview on the subject, before the broadcasting ban kicked in, a woman described how she had to bring the body of her aborted baby back in her hand luggage, so that she could bury him in Ireland. The baby was severely paralyzed and its brain had not formed, but under current medical practice in Ireland she would have had to carry the baby to full term. She also told how a family friend had committed suicide, by jumping from Dalkey Cliffs, and the young woman found herself driving towards Killiney beach where she intended to take her own life. She rang the hospital to speak to a counselor, but was told none would be provided until after the baby was born. A midwife realized that she was suicidal and managed to talk her out of killing herself. She subsequently traveled to Britain for an abortion. If somebody does what we did and how we did it, they should never have to suffer. Our women have suffered enough. It's enough, she said. The people go to the polls today (Wednesday). The result will be known on Thursday although in the final days of the campaign it was still too close to predict which side would win.","Carey, Mairead",Irish Voice,2002-03-12,1
"Archbishop Khajag Barsamian was part of a small delegation from the New York City-based Appeal of Conscience Foundation that traveled to Armenia, then Russia, two weeks ago. Archbishop Barsamian, vice president of the interfaith group, accompanied Rabbi Arthur Schneier, founder and director of the international organization that works to promote understanding and resolve conflicts through dialogue. Also part of the mission was Michael Eisentadt, a former U.S. diplomat now serving as an advisor to the Appeal of Conscience Foundation. The first item on the agenda was a one-day stop in Armenia on Tuesday, February 19, 2002. The group met with His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians; U.S. Ambassador to Armenia John Ordway; Armenia's foreign minister, Vartan Oskanian; President of the Armenian Parliament Armen Khatchatrian; Armenia's prime minister, Andranik Margarian; and Gagik Harutunian, the president of the nation's constitutional court. As previously reported, the Catholicos had invited Rabbi Schneier to Armenia to participate in 1700th-anniversary celebrations last September but, due to the terrorist attacks in New York, he was unable to accept the invitation, until now. RUSSIAN INITIATIVE Following their brief stop in Armenia, the envoys met with Russian political and social leaders in Moscow from Wednesday, February 20, through Friday, February 22. In May, President Bush is going to Russia to meet with President Putin. The goal of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation was to help religious organizations create grassroots connections, so the meeting is not only a high-level one, but with everyone involved, said Archbishop Barsamian, a board member of the interfaith organization since 1990. Other board members include Coretta Scott King, Armenian Patriarch Torkom Manoogian, and Roman Catholic Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, D.C. The Primate suggested that if the citizens of America and Russia don't talk, then any agreements made by the leaders would be worthless. And religious groups, he said, can facilitate that communication. The presidents can make decisions, but they need the support of their legislatures, and they all are answerable to the voice of the people, the Archbishop said. So it is important that when there is any sort of agreement, that is also supported by the people. And religious organizations can play an important role in creating that grass-roots level dialogue that is needed. While in Moscow, the group met with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, many national politicians, U.S. Ambassador to Russia Sandy Vershbow, as well as leader of the Russian Orthodox Church Alexy II and leaders from Russia's Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities. During their stay in Moscow, a dinner was hosted by Bishop Yezras Nersessian, the Armenian Primate of Russia and brother of Catholicos Karekin II, and Ara Abramyan, president of the Union of Armenians in Russia. The Appeal of Conscience Foundation, founded in 1965, has sent representatives to Russia many times, including trips to monitor elections and press the then Soviet government for more religious freedom. Last December, during a conference of religious figures in Brussels sponsored by the European Union and the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Rabbi Schneier tendered an invitation for Turkish and Armenian spiritual leaders to enter into a dialogue along the lines of the defunct Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission.

"The Armenian Professional Society of Los Angeles organized a very timely lecture/dinner meeting on February 22 at the Brandview Collection in Glendale., CA. The speaker was the renowned professor of Armenian and Near Eastern History at UCLA Prof. Richard Hovannisian. The topic was The Changing Strategies of Denial of the Armenian Genocide. About 70 APS members and guests were present at this most informative presentation. I would like to present to you the major topics that Prof. Hovannisian presented, enlightening us of some of the most important and delicate intricacies dealing with the denial of the Armenian Genocide. 1. Prof. Hovannisian said: The Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) did not reconcile at all. It set us back, it was not well conceived and well though of. It was well intended. The objectives were not met. Questions can be raised about the credential of the participants and who they represented. On the Turkish side, all six members were linked in one way or another to the Turkish government, and they were doing what they were told by the Turkish government. TARC also underscored the weakness of the Armenian foreign policy. It was done with the knowledge of the Armenian government, the right questions were not asked, and the foreign ministry did not provide guidelines as to what type and content of discussions should be undertook. The commission members started out by saying that they were not going to discuss the Armenian Genocide. But they found out that they could not avoid it. It was there. They therefore started talking about the Genocide and they failed. 2. Now there are a dozen Turkish scholars that admit there was something like an Armenian Genocide. And that is new. Twenty years ago, we could not find a single Turkish historian that would have admitted that there was a Genocide. However those Turkish scholars who accept the Genocide are troubling, since they say that we have to put the Genocide in context. Putting it in context means, as the Turkish side present it, look what happened to the Muslim population in the Balkans, Greece, Romania, the Chechens. The Muslims were also victimized. When you contextualize, it diminishes the gravity of the Armenian Genocide. Yes there were the muhajeers, the Muslim refugees from the Balkans, who were sent intentionally by the Young Turk government to Kharpert, Bitlis and Erzerum. And because they were refuges, they were more likely to kill people and take over Armenian homes, since they did not have roots in the Armenian areas. 3. Professor Hovannisian said: I refuse to debate whether there was an Armenian Genocide or not. I was trapped for many years. When interviewed in the presence of a Turk, the moderator will say the Armenians say this, the Turks say that. So who has the right story? The media will never dare to bring a neo-Nazi to debate with a Jewish survivor or a Jewish scholar (whether or not they witnessed the Holocaust), but this is a different category by itself. So the Armenian Genocide is debatable. I made a decision a few years ago that I am willing to talk about the causes of the Armenian Genocide, the results of it, and how to resolve the issue, but I will not debate whether or not there was an Armenian Genocide, because the evidence is so overwhelming that we are simply giving a platform to deniers. It is not important for a denier to win the debate. It is important for those deniers to be in it, or have people to listen to it. Once they have someone listening, they have already made an achievement. We need to be very cautious. This Turkish Armenian Reconciliation commission also gave the podium to the Turkish side, and they worked in bad faith. Because the Turkish commissioners went to Baku, Istanbul and Ankara and they said that this commission is pretty good because this will help us to stop the Armenians from pushing the recognition of the genocide in the European Community and Congressional resolutions. 4. Professor Hovannisian said: We always need to be alert and aware of the pitfalls and difficult it becomes to make a legal, moral or logical case that something has to be done. Dialogue hopefully will lead us in a direction to some kind of resolution and, if not resolution, at least recognition. I do not say reconciliation, I say conciliation. I think reconciliation is not on the table. Reconciliation means 'hashdvil,' conciliation is to get along with each other. I do not think that we are prepared now for reconciliation. It will be nice to. I tell my Turkish colleagues that they have done a great disservice to their own people. By their denial, they have prevented the Armenians from acknowledging the good the Turks have done. Some have intervened and saved Armenian lives during the Genocide. 5. Denial has gone through different stages. Denial starts immediately at the time when the genocide is taking place. Any genocidal regime will deny what has happened, will try to cover-up and hide what has happened, and will try to blame the victims. And that was what happened in the Armenian case. Because the Turkish government, immediately upon the beginning of the deportations and the massacres of the Armenians, sent out orders to all the governors, and all the military commanders, to gather the weapons from Armenians and to photograph them and send back all the reports of all the seditious activities the Armenians were doing. So they went around demanding weapons from Armenians, and frequently Armenians did not have weapons. They were either beaten or put in prison. And the wives had to go and buy weapons to turn them to the government to supposedly rescue their husbands, who were not rescued, but it was good plot by the Turks who photographed those weapons accusing the Armenians of seditious activities. These things are common to all cases of genocide. 6. The genocide was recognized a dozen times over by the United States Government while it was occurring. The archives of the United States are filled with at least 25,000 documents attesting to the Armenian Genocide. So what are we talking about? Obviously it is a political issue, and denial has nothing to do with historical reality. 7. After the defeat of the Young Turks, Enver, Talaat, Jemal, Behaeddin Shakir, and Dr. Nazim were court-martialed by the Turks as the organizer of the Armenian Genocide. They were condemned to death in absentia because they fled the country. And nobody really tried to bring them back to Turkey. And even the British government, which knew exactly where they were, did not try to capture them. 8. The strategy of Kemal Ataturk was not only to deny Genocide, but also to suppress memory, suppress any discussion on the subject. The Forty Days of Musa Dagh is a great humanitarian story with all the choices in the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish government stopped the production of this film in the 1930's. Again suppression of memory was the strategy. 9. The strategies of the Turkish government are continuously changing. They are spending millions of dollars. They read every Armenian newspaper, they know every event that is coming up. They find American and European academics who are sympathetic to the Turks. Help and support them to present their case. And also find out what the Armenian arguments are and find someone who can respond. 10. Rationalization is another strategy that the Turkish government uses. They say the Armenians revolted against us. It was a time of war, every state has to worry about its state security. The Americans deported 100,000 Japanese in World War II from California, Washington and Oregon. So we just did the same thing, the Turks will say. They deny intent, because the Genocide Convention says 'Genocide is killing a racial, ethnic, religious or national group in whole or in part' and it gives five categories as to how the killing end with intent. So if there is no intent, then there is no genocide. So we did not intend to kill the Armenians. We were in a war zone, we were just relocating them for our and their own security. Armenians were also siding with the Russians, so were deporting dangerous people. No intent. These are selective, out-of-context arguments. If they wanted to deport Armenians from the war zone, Armenians of Erzerum maybe, Van maybe, even Armenians of Bitlis, but what about Armenians of Ankara, Yozghat, Izmir, Adabazar and many others? All the length and width of the country, even the areas where Armenians represented 1% of the population (except Istanbul), were not spared. These are not the arguments that the Turks address. 11. And then with rationalization goes the other effective argument for the American audiences, and that is relativization. To relativize: 200,000 Armenians, 2 million Muslims, 500,000 Armenians, 5 million Muslims. So war is hell. Everybody suffers, Armenians suffered, so did the Kurds and Turks. So the Armenians have no case to claim a genocide. Again totally ignoring the means and methods of death. Probably 2 million Muslims did die in World War II in the Ottoman Empire. But they died fighting in the Turkish armies. In one case, Enver Pasha, the Minister of war, stupidly took 100,000 men in the middle of the winter to Erzerum where freezing blizzard killed about 85,000 Turks in two weeks. But he was so fixated with his ideology of pan-Turkish of reaching Baku. And who is responsible for it? The Armenians are responsible for it. And what about the thousands of Muslims, Kurds, and Turks who ended up from Van and Erzerum and Mush and Alashgert fleeing in 1915 towards Kharpert where they spent the winter and died by the thousands because there was no food? The Armenian farmers have all been killed. There was no grain, and the water supplies have been polluted because of the decomposing Armenian bodies spread disease. Who was responsible? The Armenians. Hence rationalization and relativization. 12. There are a few Turkish sites on the Internet with all kind of denials of the Armenian Genocide. 13. In 1982, at a conference on genocides in Tel Aviv, the Turkish government strongly pressured the Israeli government not to have speakers of the Armenian Genocide, one of whom was Prof. Hovannisian. The real trump card that the Turkish government played in 1982 was that if this conference went forward, they were going to seal the illegal underground railway that was operating between Iran and Turkey. After the Khomeini revolution, there were many Armenians and Jews, particularly Jews, who were fleeing Iran, through Turkey to New York or Tel Aviv. And selling that railway should stop Jews from coming to Israel. These Turkish maneuvers outraged the Jewish scholars. This shows that no issue of the Armenian Genocide remains unnoticed by the Turkish Government. 14. If the genocide is admitted then what? Prof. Hovannisian answered this question from the audience as follows: The Armenian Foreign Ministry should have gathered Armenian scholars, leaders, political people and ask that question. If and when Turkey says yes, that there has been a Genocide, some Armenians will be satisfied, others would want reparations. If the Turkish government put the money that they have been spending in denying the Genocide, that would have made a substantial amount for preparations. But are we satisfied with reparations? There is an Armenian political party that says Free, Independent, United Armenia. Is that realistic? Does anyone who says it still believe it? The point is that we have not spoken among ourselves. Nobody knows who can speak for us. In the end, in the world of nation states, it is the Armenian State that must speak, even for the Diaspora. We can have our input. That is why I am saying I expect much more from the Foreign Ministry than I have seen in last few years. 15. Without a nation state, most people cannot survive. Today we have a small state in the Caucasus, landlocked, vulnerable and weak. We must politicize, bring new generation from Armenian affairs, and participate in them. We need weeklong seminars and have the youth participate in the discussions and evaluate what we can do to make the world recognize the Armenian Genocide. Engage our intellectuals, our professionals. We need to revamp our ways. We need to educate. We have generations that don't know anything about the Genocide. And education is an ongoing process. We need a continuing organized community with and without our political parties, all of us, together. The event ended with a book signing by Prof. Hovannisian. I hope that the reader will follow the advice of Prof. Hovannisian and take and active role in Armenian life. Because, if we do not take care of ourselves, who will?","Bronozian, Harout",Armenian Reporter International,2002-03-02,1
"PATRIARCH'S VISIT TO AMERICA Once again, we can be very proud that His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew will be visiting the United States during such a crucial time in modern history. Many people have asked me, why is the Patriarch coming? My answer to them is as follows: In previous editorials, I have pointed out how Turkey is viewed by America as an extremely important strategic partner in the Middle East. As a Muslim nation itself, Turkey is trusted by other Islamic countries and thus finds itself in a key position to help resolve economic issues and broker peace in that part of the world. This, quite frankly, places Greece, Cyprus and issues of Greek concern very low on the Bush Administration's totem pole. So in anticipation of the Archons honoring the current President's parents, former President George H.W. Bush (Senior) and his wife Barbara, many Archons had urged the Patriarch to attend the upcoming annual banquet on March 9 to reaffirm and solidify relations with the First Family. When Bill Clinton was President, he paid a visit to the Patriarchate. That visit, and the fact that the Patriarch was awarded with the Congressional Medal of Honor (the highest honor of the United States) during his first stateside visit in 1997, made a significant impact. Turkey finally realized that the Ecumenical Patriarchate is important to the United States Government, and that any encroachment upon its rights would bear consequences. And on the occasion of the Patriarch's visit in honor of the former President and First Lady...VIOLA: President George W. Bush also found an occasion to invite the Patriarch to the White House. As an Archon myself, I am very happy to see this taking place because, again, it is vital to reconfirm the Patriarchate's important historical and contemporary position in the world. Hopefully, the Turkish Government will also genuinely acknowledge this fact. Welcome to America, Your All Holiness. The American people, as well as the Greek American community, are looking forward to your visit. METROPOLITAN IOACHIM I want to express my concern for Metropolitan Ioachim of Chalcedon a full and speedy recovery. Metropolitan Ioachim, the Patriarch's right-hand man, suffered a severe stroke and fell gravely ill a few days ago. I first met the Metropolitan in 1992, when he came to America and baptized my son Yianni. I will always be grateful for his friendship, and I can assure our readers that he has been a good friend to the Church in America, as well as to the Patriarchate. We should all pray for him at this time. HELLENIC TIMES ENDORSES DENNIS MEHIEL I would like to take this opportunity to endorse the candidacy of my good friend, Dennis Mehiel, in his bid for Lieutenant Governor of New York State. Dennis is honest and hardworking and has a tremendous passion for politics, and we should all do whatever we can to help him get elected to the first statewide seat ever held by a Greek American. WINTER OLYMPICS The International Olympic Committee took proper action on February 15th by suspending a judge who deliberately misjudged, and by allowing deserving Canadian athletes to share the Gold Medal for Figure Skating. The IOC simply had to do something quickly and decisively because its credibility was on the line. I watched the figure skating match on February 11th between the Canadian team (Jamie Sale and David Pelletier) and the Russian team (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) and was just as astounded as everyone else when the gold medal was awarded to the Russian pair. It was clear to 96 percent of the viewing audience that the Canadian duo really won. To make matters worse, the French judge admitted just two days later that he was coerced into voting for the Russian team. This was just totally disgraceful. While Americans hold honesty and good faith in high regard, the rest of the world appears to have different standards. But we must not bury our heads in the sand. I do not say the gold medal should be taken away from the Russian pair, but at the very least, the Canadian team deserves to share the gold medal.","Catsimatidis, John A",Hellenic Times,2002-02-28,1
"I am making this public statement and asking questions of the Armenian Assembly of America because of this organization's personal attack made upon me in their February 1, 2002 press release. The Armenian Assembly of America has publicly called me a convicted felon. Let me only say that such a character attack is exactly what Armenians have been doing for years to individuals who do not agree with them. It is their modus operandi and style to attack anything and anybody that is not to their liking! I shall merely make this very public promise to the Armenian Assembly of America: I shall employ a lawyer and sue you for this slander/libel! In this war, both of us shall be in an Armenian court of law at the same time, and you can prove to the world what you claim and, if you can't, you shall pay me damages. I defy you to prove I am a convicted felon! How can I vote in each election if I am a convicted felon? How could I have been elected to the Hazen City Council in 1996 if? I was a convicted felon? This personal attack on me is nothing more than children's playground trash talk and is not true and the Armenians know it! I shall see you in court! You be sure about that! Now dear Armenian Americans, let's get down to the real reason you made this wild and libelous and slanderous attack on me. Permit me now to ask a few questions of the Armenian Assembly of America, since they are the ones who deliberately mis-represented me to the public with their concocted tall tales about me. I absolutely refuse to permit you to divert public attention from Armenian evil actions! I am going to give you the opportunity to prove your concocted tall tales in court. Perhaps, until then, you will be so kind as to respond in detail to my questions of you, since you attempted to make my sinful life an open book to the world. Dear Armenians, let the Christian world determine which of us has something to hide and which of us does not! I am honored that the Armenian Assembly of America has placed me in such good company of very distinguished American, British, French and Russian citizen Armenians have attacked, and made up all tales about since 1918. Your distinguished historian Richard G. Hovannisian mentions all these people. How do you explain the following few examples I shall now share with you FROM HIS PEN? Is your historian a truth teller? - Armenians attacked future American President Herbert Hoover while he headed US efforts to help rebuild Europe at the end of World War I. Professor Hovannisian reports that Mr. Hoover stated that Armenian corruption, if made public, would become the greatest scandal in American charitable history. - Nasih Bek Usubbekov, an Azerbaijani public official, said of Armenia's sneak, cowardly, surprise and unprovoked attack of 1919 that Armenians were shedding the blood of innocent victims and leaving thousands of widows and orphans. - France's Prime Minister Clemenceau stated that the Armenians were a dangerous people to get mixed up with; particularly as they required a great deal of money and gave very little satisfaction. - Philippe Berthelot, secretary of the French peace delegation, stated in 1919: The great difficulty in establishing Armenia is that the Armenians practically nowhere constitute a majority. Yet the Armenians begged, whined, mooched and attacked anyone who refused to give them someone else's land. That is what Armenians did in 1919. - John Oliver Wardrop, British Chief Commissioner in Trans-Caucasia, stated there was evidence that regular Armenian Army units had attacked many unarmed Muslim villages. He also stated that the Armenians were responsible for most acts of aggression. - American Army Colonel William Haskell was sent to Armenia as the High commissioner for Relief. He resigned his position in disgust in 1920. He concluded that the Armenians were ungrateful, professional beggars. He went on to add of the Armenians that they are thieves and liars, utterly debased, incapable of helping themselves, unwilling to help each other and entirely lacking in gratitude. The Armenian response was to call him a crook, as you have said of me. The Armenians made up one of their famous tall tales and accused this United States Army officer of stealing from the relief efforts. Of course there was no proof offered! - Lord Hardinge, the British Undersecretary of State, wrote of Colonel Haskell's report: Knowing the Armenian character I am not the least surprised by this account. - Even the Russians, close friends of the Armenians, objected to their state-sponsored terror directed toward Muslims: The Russian People's Commissar sent a formal protest to the Armenians, stating that the Armenian armed forces, after plundering Zangibasar and expelling its Muslim inhabitants, have begun to attack the Sharur-Nakhichevan district. - US Senator Reed from Missouri objected on the floor of the Senate and stated his objections to America giving three fourths of a billion dollars and sending 70,000 American troops to give Armenians the Muslim lands from sea to sea that the Armenians craved. He said, A more monstrous proposition was never put before the American people. Had Armenia had its way with the United States Senate, they would have dragged America into the first Vietnam of the 20th century! - President Wilson did all in his power to help Armenia, and what were his thanks - A Sam Weems-style character attack upon the President of the United States! - Countless numbers of Christians and churches raised $50 million dollars to help Armenia after World War I. What was the Armenian response? A Sam Weems-type of character attack, claiming that the Americans has not done enough to help Armenia! - British Naval Commander Harry Lake stated that the Armenians betrayed Great Britain by joining the Bolshevik Revolution, and this was an act of treachery after the Armenians had begged hundreds of thousands of dollars of military aid from his country. - Dwight Osborne and Randal MacDonnell of the British Foreign Office wrote many reports that brimmed with sarcasm about the cowardliness, unworthiness, and pretentiousness of the Armenians who continued to clamor about the right to Turkish Armenian provinces at a time when, despite having been armed by the British, they were unable to hold on the Russian-Armenian districts that constituted the existing state. - And just how did the Armenians run their existing tiny state that they had whined, begged and mooched to get? They printed worthless paper money that wasn't backed by anything! The Armenian people paid a terrible price for this action by their dictator leaders. The Armenian Assembly of America's personal attack on me is nothing more than a continuation of this long and unbroken string of character attacks. Shame on you! All of the above stated specific examples are listed in YOUR DISTINGUISHED Armenian Professor Richard G. Hovannisian's four volumes of books on a mere two and a half years of Armenia's history. If the good professor isn't a truth teller, with regard to any one of these examples, I shall be delighted to make a public apology as to HIS TALL TALES! I am in very good company to now be attacked by the Armenian Assembly of America! Armenian Americans never cease to amaze me with their telling of tall tales and their waging of hate campaigns! Because the Armenian Assembly of America has chosen to attempt to divert public attention from the real issues by making their character attack upon me, it is only fair and right that I now be permitted to ask questions of this Armenian hate group! I ask these good Armenians, who comprise the Armenian Assembly of America, to answer a few very real questions for me as an American Christian taxpayer because they have questioned me. Now it is my turn. This is only fair and just: [1] How cab attack a book that you have never read? What kind of people are you? Not one of you has bothered to contact me about what you claim some Turkish organization published? Do you believe everything anyone prints without verification? Don't you agree that at least one Armenian should have asked me, if what a third party said was true, before you ruthlessly attacked me? [2] You object to my using the term Armenian Colony that Armenia established in the United States in 1918. How do you explain the fact this term in my book it is a direct quote from your own Armenian history professor Richard G. Hovannisian in his four-volume history titled The Republic of Armenia? Had you asked, you would have learned that more than 90% of my book comes directly from the pen of your very own Armenian history professor! [3] You make a personal attack on me. You honor me by putting me into a group of very distinguished American, French, Russian and British citizens Armenians have attacked over the years. You will read the statements these distinguished individuals made (a few are listed above) in your good professor's four volumes of books. Why do Armenians resort to such hate tactics year after unending year? [4] The Armenian Assembly of America, by making an attack on this Baptist American taxpayer, attacks EVERY Christian taxpayer in the United States who dares to ask questions. I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to answer why the United States should give Armenia billions of dollars while Armenians have invited the Russians to come in, build military bases and station Russian troops in their tiny, landlocked, poverty-stricken state? Why not let the Russians keep up your self-claimed 200-year-old ancient homeland? [5] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to explain in detail how Armenians used the more than one billion dollars in military hardware they obtained from the Russians while they were begging and mooching $1.5 billion dollars from the United States? [6] What specific benefit does the United States of America receive in return for giving billions of dollars to Armenia and by offending nearby Muslim states? [7] As a Baptist, I want the Armenian Assembly of America to explain why Armenian state police goon squads attacked and broke up the services of the 3 or 4 remaining Baptist churches in Armenia? Just why won't Armenia allow other Christian faiths to come into their tiny state? You want our Christian church money but refuse us the right to reach our on behalf of Christ in your state. Why? [8] AS a Christian I want the Armenian Assembly of America to explain why Armenia made a sneak, cowardly, surprise and unprovoked attack on Azerbaijan in 1992? You call my statement primitive phraseology. You can call it anyway you like it but you are not able to cover the truth of the horror and terror your government created with that attack. Countless thousands of unarmed Muslims were massacred, and Armenia drove more than one million of them from their homes, just so Armenia could make a free land grab? This isn't a Christian act! Why did Armenia do such horrible things to fellow human beings? Christ would not approve of such a terrible thing! Why did Armenia do this? [9] In the Armenian Assembly of America's press release attacking me, they brag about how the American Congress passed a meaningless resolution congratulating Armenia on making its 1700th anniversary of Christianity in that country. The Armenian-American community is just like Enron! They have poured millions of dollars into trying to buy American politicians. The answer to the Armenian Assembly of America statement is this: Mega bucks buy meaningless resolutions! And they hardly ever change the truth! [10] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to explain to the American taxpayers the benefits they receive for the $1.5 billion dollars they have given to Armenia in the last decade. American taxpayers want and demand to know what, if anything; they are getting for their hard-earned money! [11] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to tell the American people the truth why they opposed President Bush's effort to win the War on Terrorism of reaching out to Muslim countries of the world? [12] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to tell the American people why they lobbied to obtain $1.5 billion of their dollars for their tiny landlocked state that, in truth, is less than 200 year old? There are no restrictions on Armenia for the use of these mega dollars against Muslim Azerbaijan. You lobbied to prevent President Bush from helping Muslim Azerbaijan and lost. Next, you lobbied to restrict any money the United States gave Azerbaijan to make certain it could not be used against your Armenia. Please explain your logic in undercutting America's War on Terrorism by your conduct, by your double standard. [13] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to take the lead in asking for Armenia to make restitution to Muslim Azerbaijan for the stealing of their lands! This is the right and Christian thing to do. How can Armenia demand that Turkey make restitution for a wild made-up tall tale of massacre that is claimed to have happened in 1915 when Armenia stole Muslim lands by force of arms today? Isn't this a double standard? The truth is the good Armenian Professor, Richard G. Hovannisian, gives the names of both American and British eyewitness who prove that there could not have been a massacre/genocide as Armenians claim. Frankly speaking, I choose to believe the Americans and British rather than self-seeking, scheming, lying Armenian lobbyists! [14] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to explain why their Armenian Revolutionary Federation archives that are located in America are not open to the general public for research? [15] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to explain why this self-admitted terrorist organization (Armenian Revolutionary Federation) is even located within the United States of America. There is no place in America for terrorist organizations of any kind! [16] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to publicly denounce the Armenian assassination of Turkish diplomats around the world. Armenians murdered 4 Turks here in the United States of America. No Armenian organization has condemned these murders of United States' guests. There is no place in today's society for terrorism and the Armenian Assembly of America should welcome the opportunity to denounce such terrible murders! [17] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to denounce the bombing of an American university professor's home by Armenian terrorists! [18] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to denounce the Armenian terrorist threats of bombing that caused a Turkish cultural group to cancel American performances! [19] I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to denounce Armenian disruption of an American filmmaker's attempt to show a movie relating to the Christian heritage in Turkey. America has no place for such terrorist activity and the Armenian Assembly of America should welcome the opportunity to denounce such Armenian thug activity! [20] I call upon then Armenian Assembly of America to practice their claim of 1700 years of the Christian faith they claim to follow. I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to follow the teachings of Christ when He calls out loudly over 2000 years of history to say FORGIVE - AND LOVE THY NEIGHBOR! The Armenian Assembly of America makes the wild and made-up typical tall tale that I am a Turkish lackey. THE QUESTIONS I AM ASKING SHOW JUST WHO I AM A LACKEY FOR - ALL AMERICAN CHRISTIAN TAXPAYERS! NO MORE-NO LESS! It is none of any American Christian taxpayer's business relating to relationships the Armenians have with Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia or any of their neighbors. I do object, as an American Christian taxpayer, to paying for evil acts committed by Armenians, and I call upon the Armenian Assembly of America to read books before foaming at the mouth! I call on the Armenian Assembly of America to practice the teaching of Christ and stop begging and mooching my tax money for the use of evil acts! In the meantime, Armenian Assembly of America, I shall see you in the courtrooms of this great land. In a libel suit, truth is a perfect defense AND I WELCOME PROVING TO YOU THAT I HAVE NEVER BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY! Armenians are big on wanting damages. The only question there will be in my lawsuit is how much of a cash award I will receive as damages from the Armenian Assembly of America! In the meantime, dear Armenians, let's you and I deal with the real issues. I look forward to your direct and honest answers to my questions. So, stop the playground trash talk and be honest and direct if you can! The real issue for Americans is not if Sam Weems is a sinner because he is. The real issue is that Armenia deceived and fleeced the American Christians, their churches and their government out of billions of dollars while pretending to follow Jesus Christ! I think I now understand how Christ felt when he threw the unscrupulous moneychangers out of the temple because their only concern was making money just as Armenians are making money from Christians, churches and Christian governments around the world. Since September 11, the world in which we live has changed. The Christian world must reach out to the Muslims world, regardless of whether Armenians like it or not! This is the real issue, whether the Armenian Assembly of America likes it or not!","Weems, Samuel A",Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-23,1
"His Eminence Archbishop Oshagan Choloyan represented the Holy See of Cilicia at the World Economic Forum, which took place in New York City from January 31 to February 4. Usually held in Davos. Switzerland, the venue was changed to New York City following the terrorist attacks of September 11, as a show of solidarity and support for the city. Thirty countries were represented by their respective heads of state, and 100 countries were represented by designated high-level representatives. Also attending in large numbers were specialists in various fields, including politics, business, economics, health, the media, entertainment, etc. For the second time, the World Economic Forum invited the participation of religious leaders. Attending were representatives of Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu faiths. Mr. Klaus Schwab, the founder and organizer of this annual gathering, welcomed all of the participants and expressed the hope, that, in the next few days, the exchange of ideas and thoughts would result in the adoption of new civility. A new civility that would bring about a more advanced world without the fear to tackle global problems like poverty, health, human rights, and economic issues. Also speaking during the welcoming ceremonies were Switzerland's Mr. Kasper Villager, New York's governor and mayor, George Pataki, and Michael Bloomberg respectively. They recalled the events of September 11 and the universal struggle against all types of evil in order to make the world environmental safe and hospitable. The discussions, which - centered around one of the main themes of Forum, Leadership in Fragile Times, started with the imperative of hope. The message of the participants was that we must not lose hope in the face of economic and political problems, said Archbishop Oshagan. On the contrary we need to establish new hope in the face of lost hopes. The leaders emphasized the fact that the war is not just a military endeavor. There is a war against hunger, the war against poverty, the war against illness. It is the responsibility of all nations to do their share in eradicating poverty because poverty is evil for humanity. The representatives said that all nations must look inward, make themselves transparent and accountable in all frontiers. In the face of this duty, they concluded, all leaders, religious, political, and economic, must help create a better life so that the international family can live a hopeful and productive life. A good part of the Forum was devoted to the Middle East, economic advancement, religious fanaticism and the many questions that need to be addressed after the talking. They emphasized that the most important thing is a united struggle against terrorism. Terrorism has no religion, they said, terrorism has no geographic boundaries, and terrorism cannot be justified. The international leaders were especially unified in saying that the growing problems in the Middle East cannot be left only to the involved parties. A global war on terrorism cannot be successful without the United States dealing directly with the Middle East and bringing about a just and complete peace. The Forum ended Monday evening, February 4, with the hope that the global questions that were examined during the forum would not be translated into constructive work leading to brotherhood and a peaceful life for all. Archbishop Oshagan noted that the religious leaders examined the proposal for a Religious Council within the World Economic Forum and concluded that the role of such a Council needed first to be defined and clarified before further steps could be taken. Archbishop Oshagan was discussion leader on February 4, on Global Leaders for Tomorrow. A visit to Ground Zero took place on Sunday, February 3, where religious leaders offered prayers in memory of the victims and the heroic rescuers.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-23,1
"Samuel A. Weems's new book could be titled One Good Reason the Muslim World hates the United States. This book exposes selfish and wrong actions of the tiny state of Armenia and how they continue to use Christianity to obtain foreign aid from Christian nations and funding by Christian churches. Weems notes that foreign aid is the number-one import of Armenia today and terrorism is this tiny state's number-one export. The author of this book is a Scottish American, a lifelong Baptist, and a taxpayer. He has done extensive research in archives in Washington, DC, London, England, Paris, France, Moscow, Russia and Istanbul, Turkey. The Armenian archives are located in Yerevan, Armenia and are not open to the public. Also not open to the public are the archives of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, a political terrorist organization located in Boston, Massachusetts. These two Armenian archives have escaped scholarly research and scrutiny to this very day. The author asks, What are the Armenians trying to hide? The author asks such questions as why an Armenian terrorist organization, which gained dictatorial power of Armenia in 1918, has its archives in the United States? Why are such archives closed to the general public, when the Armenians take advantage of the tax-exempt laws of the United States? During the research process for this book, the author discovered that the tiny state of Armenia established what it calls its Armenian colony in the United States in 1918. In addition, Armenia established the Armenian National Union of America, the Armenian Press Bureau based in New York and other Armenian-based groups in America at the same time. The sole purpose of these political action organizations was to seek out U.S. government funding and also money and contributions from Christians throughout the United States. In addition, these self-serving Armenian groups work in influence American public opinion, lobby elected officials, and oppose anything connected to Azerbaijan and Turkey. Such efforts that began during World War I continue unabated to this very day. Armenia claims to be the first Christian state on earth, dating back 1700 years. The question is asked: Is Armenia really Christian as tested by true Christian standards? What has been the role of the one and only official Armenian state church in terrorist activists? The chapter of this book titled Holy Terror is revealing, because this is the first time anyone has researched Armenian Apostolic Church (also known as the Armenian Orthodox Church) and its leadership role in state-sponsored terrorism! The author provides clear evidence, time after time, that Armenia has played, and continues to play, the Christian vs. Muslim religion/race/ethnic card with great success, regardless of truth. For example, in 1992, with a billion dollars in Russian military aid, Armenia made a surprise-sneak attack on its neighbor Azerbaijan. Armenia quickly captured 20% of the country and drove more than one million poor Azerbaijanis from their homes. These Muslims live today in tent-city squalor. Clearly, this conduct was not love your neighbor as your self, as Christ taught. Proof is given that the Armenian Church (the state constitution makes it the official church of Armenia) has been, and continues to be, a leader in promoting and supporting ongoing terrorist activities. The author hasn't discovered any evidence that this so-called church speaks out in opposition to terrorist acts - even when Armenians were assassinating Turkish diplomats on a regular basis throughout the world, starting in the 1970s and continuing throughout the 1980s. Far from denouncing Armenian terrorism, the Armenian Church was the scene of systematic fund-raising efforts designed to finance the legal defense of the few Armenian terrorists who were caught and later convicted. The government of the United States backed this self-called tiny Christian state by thereafter providing 1.4 billion dollars in foreign aid, courtesy of the American taxpayer. That is more foreign aid per person than to any other country on earth. At the same time, the United States Congress cut foreign aid assistance to Azerbaijan. The reason for this American government action is the result of the successful lobby work of the Armenian colony within the United States. Armenian-American lobbyists worded, handed over to some American lawmakers and eventually secured a national law that declares, on behalf of the United States government, that Azerbaijan created an illegal blockade. All Azerbaijan did was to refuse to allow the tiny landlocked state of Armenia's permission to use Azerbaijan's ports to bring in military supplies to be used against the Azerbaijanis. This self defense was successfully misrepresented to the U.S. lawmakers as illegal blockade. Specific evidence is provided to prove how the Armenian-American colonists lobbied American lawmakers to punish Azerbaijan, because this nation defended itself from the Christians and refused to allow Armenia the privilege of transporting military supplies across Azerbaijani soil, to then use against Azerbaijan. Wouldn't any nation on earth do the same thing? However, the United States government backed these Christian lobbyists. Author Weems asks the question: Why did the United States join with Russia and take sides in a domestic matter against Azerbaijan? The only answer is, it's a Christian vs. Muslim conflict. The Christians were wrong in the days of the Crusades, just as they are wrong in getting mixed up with the Armenians today! The author asks the question: Isn't this American support of joining with the Russians, to help Christian Armenia steal a neighbor's land by the use of terrorism and force more than one million poor Muslims from their homes, a very good reason for the Muslim world to hate Americans? The sad story is that Armenia has been carrying out terrorist actions since 1918 that continue to this day. What is even sadder is the fact that the United States government and too many American Christians still support Armenians by giving money to Armenia just because of the false Armenian claim: We are fellow Christians. All Christians in the United States must read this book and do their own investigation to determine for themselves the true story of Armenia. The author provides example after example of how Armenians used terrorism as official policy, even before the founding of their Armenian Revolutionary Federation in 1890, and how a small band of dictators mislead their own people an established a dictatorial government that continues to use systematic violence to advance their causes to this day. This book, among many revelations, will provide answers to many questions: It uncovers the name and official position of the person who made up the tall tale that the Ottoman government massacred 1.5 million Armenians. This book also reveals the actual date this wild tall tale was first told, and who the tall tale was told to. Weems then provides the evidence as to how the tall tale was then spread throughout the Christian world, continuing down to this very day. It uncovers and reveals all the details of why the Ottoman government kicked out all the Armenians who lived in the eastern part of the country in 1915. Proof is provided that the Ottoman government had good cause to remove Armenians from behind their army that was fighting the Russians. The reason was simple. Armenians were helping the invading Russians, by disrupting the Ottoman army supply lines. Armenians, who pretended to be the friends of the ottomans for more than 500 years, were playing friends by day and terrorists by night! Any nation on earth would have done the same thing when the nation was in danger of being destroyed! The author has uncovered several American and British eyewitnesses who saw the Armenians leave the Ottoman lands. The question every reader will have to answer is this: Whom do your believe? American and British officials who saw the Armenians leave the country, or the wild tall tales made by 'Armenians' who still use this ever-growing tall tale as an excuse to try to get free handouts from throughout the Christian world? In this book the reader will discover that the author provides evidence, given by an Armenian historian, which proves that Armenians kept two sets of books. One to support their made-up tall tale that 1.5 million of their people were massacred, and another set of books to count the same 1.5 million Armenians as refugees, so that more foreign handouts could be secured. One set of books to create pity, another to rake in the money unsuspecting Christians showered them with! The proof is that there simply cannot be 1.5 million Armenian people massacred, when the same 1.5 million Armenian people counted as refugees. One cannot be dead and alive at the same time! This book reveals, in detail, how Armenia has double-dealt friends and neighbors throughout history, with threads of continuity reaching to this every day. This book provides proof that Armenia committed far more terrorist acts than those Ottomans they accuse of committing. Armenians claim that they are fighting to reclaim their ancient homeland. This book provides the evidence to prove that the lands Armenians claim as ancient has only been their home for less than 200 years, and that the Russians drove out and killed millions of Muslims and gave their ancient homelands to the Armenians. Why did the Russians do this? Both the Russians and Armenians were the same sort of Christians while the Muslims were different! This is a book that every American taxpayer must read! President Bush is attempting to build friendships throughout the Muslim world because of the extremist Muslim attacks on New York and Washington, DC on September 11. American taxpayers will discover how Armenian-American colonists are opposing the president's war on terrorism for their own selfish interests. This book presents facts that will cause every non-Armenian Christian in the United States to raise his or her voice to protest the continuation of federal government support and giving the taxpayers' hard-earned dollars as aid to Armenia, because Armenia is fighting the president and the United States' war on terrorism! Samuel A. Weems does not have a drop of Armenia, Azerbaijani, or Turkish blood in his veins. He is a lifelong Christian. He is very active in his church and has recently produced an excellent video titled The Seven Churches of Revelation. He spent eight weeks in Turkey making this video and doing research on this book. He writes a regular newspaper column, and he has a great deal of experience in the political arena. He was elected one of one hundred delegates to rewire his state's constitution. He served as an elected member of his city council. He was elected district attorney and judge. While serving as a district attorney, he did extensive work in Washington, DC to reform the nation's welfare and prison systems. Samuel A. Weem's ability to research and go directly to the heart of a problem, thanks to his legal background, is revealed in this excellent book that will cause every non-Armenian American to become alarmed by the actions and conduct of such fellow citizens. This author provides clear and convincing proof that Armenia is working to do things that endanger the safety and welfare of all citizens within the United States! This, in spite of the fact that U.S. citizens are keeping Armenia alive with their tax dollars! Armenia, The Great Deception: Secrets of a Christian State is a must read for all Americans who seek the truth and want to know how their tax dollars and missionary church money is spent!

"Armenia's future relations with its neighboring countries is a concern that is shared by all interested parties, including policymakers in the Western European capitals, Washington, Moscow, Tehran, Ankara, Baku, Tbilisi, and even in distant capitals like Beijing and New Delhi. Why is the small and landlocked mountainous country of Armenia suddenly taking center stage in the Caucasus, and why is the government of Armenia frequently hosting foreign officials and dignitaries? The answer is obvious: the energy-rich Caucasus and Central Asia, recently the war in Afghanistan, and a possible war in Iraq have attracted the attention of strategists in Washington and Moscow. The U.S., Russia, China, India and neighboring Turkey are all trying to influence political events in this volatile, yet strategically important region. As necessitated by their economic, military, and geopolitical interests and concerns, political strategists in Washington and Moscow are taking into consideration more seriously the existing historical enmity, discord and disputes among the various ethnic and national groups in the region, and are trying to figure out ways to promote regional peace and cooperation, naturally in accordance with their national interests. The Russian Federation's embassy complex, located on Grigor Lusavorich Street in Yerevan, is so gigantic in size that it dwarfs any Russian embassy buildings elsewhere, including Washington and Ankara. In addition, the recent opening of the Russian Consulate General building in the border city of Gyumri, and the construction of the new $10-million U.S. Embassy building near Yerevan Lake, prove that the superpowers are well entrenched in Armenia with their own future plans, full of economic, military and geopolitical implications. It is rather revealing that the Armenian armed forces are armed with sophisticated Russian and Chinese military hardware - again in accordance with the national interests of Russia and China, making Armenia's border impenetrable for Pan-Turkish expansionism. By the same token, the U.S. and NATO want to cultivate military relations and cooperation with Armenia, based on the Partnership-for-Peace program, in order not to leave the field alone to the Russians. According to U.S. military analysts, the Armenian armed forced in both Armenia and Karabagh are ranked the best equipped, most combat tested and disciplined army among those of the former Soviet republics. Based on the above facts, one may comfortably assert that Armenia's profile will be further enhanced, if the following fundamental principles are met, which are considered to be universal requirements for any nation-state that wants to be free and independent, and to enjoy respect of the others. 1) Strong economy. 2) Well-established democracy. 3) A functioning independent judiciary and the maintenance of law and order within the constitutional framework. 4) Elimination of corruption. 5) Fair taxation. 6) Modernization in education and science. 7) Internal stability based on the development of political culture and civility. 8) Fair distribution of national wealth, preservation of social net and stability with full employment. 9) Maintenance of a strong, well- trained, equipped army, aid force and border unites under civilian control. 10) Pursuance of an effective, dynamic foreign policy and participation in international organizations to defend and promote Armenia's interests. 11) Establishment of public information desk in the government to combat misinformation spread by hostile foreign centers. 12) Alliance with friendly nations to create mutually beneficial economic, military, political, scientific and cultural interrelations. 13) Adherence to national values and principles, including securing universal recognition of the Armenian Genocide with its implications. Armenia's future relations with Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan and other countries will be influenced by these facts. Based on recent political activities, one may anticipate the following developments. RELATIONS BETWEEN RUSSIA, ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN Russian President Vladimir Putin is pursuing pragmatic complementary foreign policy, advancing the idea of partnership among CIS/NIS member states. On the domestic front, in turn, he is implementing democratic, economic and political reforms, and striving to eliminate corruption, tax evasion, organized crime and to curb the power of the oligarchs. Turning back to the foreign arena, Russia is cooperating with the U.S. in the energy fields, increasing oil production and making it available to Western markets to carve a monopoly of the oil cartel. Moscow is declaring readiness to cooperate in the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline projects, and actively assisting the U.S. antiterrorist campaign in Afghanistan by selling arms and ammunition to Northern Alliance Forces, paid for by the U.S. government. In the case of Armenia, Moscow keeps sending numerous high-ranking military and political envoys to Yerevan, and cultivating a military and security alliance. Turning to the economic field, by assuming ownership of some important Armenian enterprises and factories in exchange for Armenia's $99 million debt, Russia is securing its presence in Armenia. To reciprocate President Kocharian's complementary policy, which is fostering friendly relations with both Washington and Moscow, President Putin is conducting his own complementary foreign policy in the Caucasus, establishing close relations with Baku. Azeri President Heydar Aliyev, during his state visit to Russia, signed many important agreements with his counterpart on 01/26/02. Accordingly, Russia will maintain its military base at the sophisticated Gabala early-earning radar station, worth $2 billion, and this agreement will allow Russia to post 1,500 servicemen at this base. The presence of the Russian base in Azerbaijan prevents Azeri propagandists from disseminating propaganda and conducting verbal attacks against Armenia for providing abase on its soil to the Russian military. Besides Armenia and Georgia, Russia has now secured an additional military post in the Caucasus. The Russo-Azeri rapprochement is causing great concern in Ankara, infuriating leaders there. The Turks are now reconsidering their Caucasian policy. Even the Georgians are offering to cooperate with Moscow to control the activities of the Chechen militants in Panski gorge, and Georgian strongman Eduard Shevardnadze is not pressing any more for the departure of Russian peacekeepers from Abkhasia, creating additional concerns in Ankara. The Azeri and Russian Presidents also inked numerous trade and cultural agreements, have reached a consensus of dividing the Caspian Lake into economic zones, and begun talk about a strategic alliance. Like his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, President Putin also proclaims that there is no alternative to a peaceful settlement of the Karabagh conflict. There will be no winners or losers, he said without elaborating. It is important to note that, despite Baku's denial, Russian and French mediators are now talking about Agreed Paris Principles. The Azeri leader is now urging a greater Russian role in the Karabagh talks, and the U.S. Ambassador in Baku is proclaiming that neither the U.S. nor any other NATO country intends to locate its bases in Azerbaijan in the near future. All these interesting developments have positive and negative implications for Armenia. Both Washington and Moscow are pursuing their own national interests in the Caucasus, which do not necessarily coincide with those of Armenia or Azerbaijan. RELATIONS BETWEEN TURKEY, ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN Turkey refuses to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia and conditions such a development on the fulfillment of the following terms: 1) Abandonment of the Genocide claims. 2) Recognition of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and recognition of Azeri sovereignty over Karabagh. 3) Unconditional and immediate evacuation of the Armenian Armed Forces from Karabagh and occupied surrounding districts. 4) Opening of a corridor between Azerbaijan proper and the Azeri enclave of Nakhichevan by going through the territory of Armenian. This is the tip of the iceberg. If Armenia complies, Ankara will probably come up with additional demands, and will ask for closure of the Russian bases in Armenia, extradition of Karabagh leadership to Azerbaijan for prosecuting on charges of conducting terrorism against Azeri Turks, and demanding war reparations, since Azeris are claiming that Armenians occupation of the Azeri land caused $10 billion damage. Hostile anti-Armenian propaganda emanating from Ankara and its voices in the Turkish Forum and the Turkish Daily News in the U.S. is making a mockery out of those well-intentioned people who are hoping that they can find a common language with the Turks in order to reach a reconciliation, rapprochement or dialogue. Yet the Turkish Forum and the Turkish Daily news, non-official voices of Ankara in Washington, are nowadays promoting a book written by Sam Weems, a so-called Christian intellectual from the Southern Baptist community in Arkansas. His academic credentials are unknown, and Turks are claiming that he has done extensive research in the archives in Washington, London, Paris, Moscow and Istanbul. The Turks are intending to send his books, full of anti-Armenian venom an lies, to the Congressmen and Senators and libraries across the U.S. Why are the Turks finding it useful to promote this charlatan officially, at the time when some people are talking about reviving the Turkish Armenian reconciliation process? Because the Turkish generals are not seriously interested in reconciliation. THE CASE OF SAM WEEMS The Turkish Daily News, in its 01/26/02 issue, printed the following: Sam Weems, who is a Christian religious intellectual, is proving that the religious allegations of the Armenians are baseless, just like the historical allegations themselves, and continued, Weems was born in Arkansas state, in the south, which is known as the religion belt and received law education. The retired prosecutor defined himself as a strong Christian believer and a southern Baptist. He stated that he was ashamed of the Christianity which has been applied by the Armenians. The Religion of the Armenians, just like their historical claims, is fake. The TND continues to quote this charlatan: While begging for Western aid, they had claimed that they had lost many people, the number of which was more than their existing population. But when it comes to the necessity of the formation of a state, they have shown all their dead citizens alive for proving how crowded they had been. The book is titled The Great Deception: Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State; according to the Turkish Forum, it is published by St. John Press. The Turkish forum continues, Samuel A. Weem's new book could be titled 'One Good Reason The Muslim World Hates The United States,' and adds, this book exposes selfish and wrong actions by the tiny state of Armenia and how they continue to use Christianity to obtain foreign aid from Christian nations and funding by Christian Churches. Weems notes that foreign aid is the number-one import of Armenia today, the terrorism is this tiny state's number one export. The Turkish Forum further elaborates that this book uncovers the details of why the Ottoman government kicked out all the Armenians who lived in the eastern part of the country in 1915, proof is that the Ottoman government had a good cause to remove Armenians from behind their army that was fighting the Russians. It is not even worth it to quote or read this garbage, yet it confirms that this kind of rhetoric, falsification and anti-Armenian propaganda is the only policy that Turks can offer today, in terms of Turkish-Armenian relations. Turkey's policy against Armenia remains hostile. Turks are trying to encircle Armenia and are aiming to establish military bases in Georgia and Azerbaijan. According to the Armenian newspaper Mamara published in Istanbul on 01/26/02, Turkish radio and TV channels continue to attack Armenian, Greek and Jewish communities, and are slandering them with disloyalty and anti-Turkish activities. TWO-TRACK POLICY VERSUS ARMENIA Turkey will continue a two-track policy against Armenia. While conducting hostile and trying to encircle and isolate Armenia, they will promote human contacts to gather information, conduct espionage, and distract Armenians and foreigners from the main issues, only giving the impression of reconciliation without compromising. Turkish journalists, artists, musicians, literary figures, and minor politicians will reciprocate visits by Armenian counterparts and continue to make pleasant statements, yet as long as the government in Ankara and the Turkish generals continue to avoid direct talk with the Armenian government in order to conduct serious political, economic and diplomatic negotiations, Turkish-Armenian relations have no prospect of improvement. The recent spy scandal proves once more than the Turkish intentions are no good. The arrest of the Turkish spy Murad Bojolian (born in Sivas, Turkey and immigrated to Armenia) shows how the Turks are trying to undermine Armenia's security. Arrested spy Murad Bojolian once had a high official position in Armenia's Foreign Ministry. He was the personal interpreter of former President Levon Ter-Petrossian and frequently visited Turkey with the late Telman Ter-Petrossian (LTP's brother). As the case unravels, it may have serious implications but, at the very least, it is fair to say that this incident will set back further reconciliation efforts in the near future.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-09,1
"Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, was one of a number of religious leaders anticipating in the World Economic Forum in New York City from January 31 through February 3, 2002. The Primate represented His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, at the global gathering of about 3,000 business, political, entertainment, and religious leaders who meet each year to discuss economic policy. This year's speakers included former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Afghan Interim Prime Minister Hamid Karzai. Religious leaders attending covered a variety of religions and included Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey; Rev. Desmond Tutu of South Africa; the Chief Rabbi of Israel, Meir Lau; Roman Catholic Cardinal Theodore McCarick of Washington, D.C.; Dr. Abdullah Nasseef, president of the World Muslim Congress, Dr. Konrad Raiser, general secretary of the World Council of Churches. Archbishop Oshagan Choloyan represented the Armenian See of Cilicia at the conference. During the five-day conference, participants took part in a variety of workshops focusing on everything from stress management to global business competition. Other panels focused on individual countries, including one dealing with the social crisis in Turkey. Panels dealing with faith covered topics such as bridging religious divides, understanding fundamentalism, and a discussion on what ideas are sacred in today's world. Our aim as human beings should be to make our lives sacred. It is the role of religion to help the life of each individual be sacred, said Archbishop Barsamian, who most recently represented Catholicos Karekin II at a daylong prayer session organized by the Vatican earlier this month. There is wisdom here. The forum is not only economic, but how to use the gifts of God to help human beings be sacred.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-09,1
"One of the reasons that Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit advances the cause of his country as a successor to Britain as the leader of the international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan is that the U.S. has stated ad nauseam that Turkey is the ideal role model for Islamic states. I could support the Turks in their coveted role if Turkey were a democracy and if the Moslem world would accept Turkey as their model. But neither is the case. Turkey as a role model for the rest of the Islamic world may be satisfactory for Washington, but the states that have to be happy with the model are basically Arabic and they are not buying the American package. Karen Armstrong recently wrote an article called Ghosts of our Past. In it she states that Throughout the Muslim world there is widespread bitterness against America, even among pragmatic and well-educated businessmen and professionals, who may sincerely deplore the recent atrocities, condemn them as evil, and feel sympathy with the victims, but who still resent the way the Western powers have behaved in their countries. Ms. Armstrong's article did not specifically focus on Turkey, but her sentiments aptly apply. The U.S. government completely ignores that the pyramids, ancient cities, old forts and castle-like structures, etc., existed hundreds and thousands of years before Washington was a dream. These ancient structures have brought the past into the present. The Arab nations may have booming modern cities but, as they drill for oil to sell to the West, they continue to see Turkey as a threat. They paid for separation from the Turks with their blood and they are not about to relinquish their way of life for the sole reason that Turkey is a secular state. The Arab states and their citizens understand that being secular is no guarantee that the freedoms enjoyed by the West are mandated or that corruption will cease. The Turkish role model touted by the U.S. is the perfect example. The contradictions that exist in Turkey and which are overlooked by the U.S. for strategic reasons are feared and sneered at by the Arab peoples as hypocrisy. Without question, Mustafa Kemal is one of the most powerful, and perhaps the most influential and leading, figures in Turkish history. Yet, there are few events in his reign or those of his successors in Turkey that qualify as democratic. Kemal purported Western values, but his actions and legacy carried out in Turkey by his successors as the replacement of Islam are more in line with Middle Eastern potentates, with the exception that theocracy no longer exists. But because the citizens vote, many Turkophiles call it a democracy. The fact remains that the Soviet Union was not a theocracy, but every had the right, indeed the responsibility, to vote. As with Kemalism, communism assumed the position of organized religion. Dare we call the Soviet Union a democracy? It was military might that propelled the Soviet Union to its position as a world leader. The same type of power has pushed Turkey into a prominent position in the region. Neither Turkey not the Soviet Union has ever had academic freedom or freedom of expression. There is not much difference in the torture practiced either. The scorn for human rights and dignity is the same. The difference in the numbers of innocent people who died is a matter of degree, not of horror. Moscow attempted to create the Soviet person. Ankara, since Ataturk, has demanded Turkification. The Soviets converted churches into the nondescript buildings, which the Turkish government transformed many Armenian and Greek churches into mosques. William Dalrymple, in his book From the Holy Mountain (1997), tells of the Armenian cathedral in Urfa being converted into a fire station from 1915 until 1994, when it was converted into a mosque. The author witnessed beautiful, old wooden Armenian ecclesiastical works thrown into a pile to be burned. The Soviets claimed that they had no nationality problem. The Turkish government says it has no Kurdish problem; it just has a terrorist dilemma. One could go on for volumes examining the similarities between these two authoritarian states. Both Turkey and the USSR came into being at approximately the same time. The latter has disappeared. On January 19, Bulent Aras wrote in the Turkish Daily News that the Sevres Syndrome is alive and well in Turkey and there is a fear among the security elites of Turkey that the country is on the verge of disintegration. Mr. Aras concludes that Turkey has aligned itself with forces that are considered enemies of the Arab states and has marginalized itself with the Islamic world. This is the country that has come to the U.S. seeking to assume the leading peacekeeping role in Afghanistan and which wants to act as the role model for the rest of the Muslim world to emulate. Fortunately, President Bush sees the dangers. He also understands that Turkey's role has a price. Turkey is not limbering up its war wagon cheaply nor will the government sent its troops to Afghanistan as a stalwart against terrorism. Mr. Ecevit and the 300 or so business people who came with him arrived in Washington to bargain for a large profit. The Turkish troops are being handed to the U.S. as mercenaries. The Assembly of Turkish American Associations (ATAA) attempted to grease the skids for the Prime Minister, who had opposed Turkish cooperation with the U.S. during the Gulf war. According to the ATAA, the real meaning of the term strategic partnership and the measures that could demonstrate the true value of America's friendship and our appreciation of Turkey in real terms are payments to Turkey. First, the ATAA asked that Turkey be provided preferential trade agreements that include lifting of existing trade barriers. Forty percent of Turkey's textile industry comes to the U.S. They want a larger share. Turkey wants to be elevated to the same status as European Union countries. Second, Ankara desires that the U.S. write off all military debts at taxpayer expense. Both of these measures are supposed to prevent the resurgence of radical Islamic sentiment in Turkey by simulating a rapid economic recovery. I guess the billions of dollars of World Bank loans that the U.S. supported is not payment enough. Third, Turkey wishes continued U.S. support for admission into the European Union. Never mind that the Europeans are aghast at the minimal efforts Ankara has made to abide by their term for admittance. For years Turkey has talked about the alleged indispensable role it has played as a member of NATO. Now the argument goes: As the most developed and modern Muslim nation, the civilized world has a stake in helping Turkey succeed. Additionally, Turkey is not happy with the list of organizations that the U.S. has listed as terrorist, and wants the U.S. to agree with those on Turkey's list. Further, the U.S. should acknowledge the listing of states that Turkey has alleged to have weapons of mass destruction. The U.S. has already given Turkey $20M for the Afghanistan mission and does not appear to be enthusiastic about giving more. President Bush wisely did not commit himself to Turkey as the state to receive the hand-off from Britain as the lead peacekeeping country in Afghanistan. The President is diplomatic enough to talk the foreign policy game, but he knows what a loaded deck is.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-02,1
"His Eminence Archbishop Oshagan Choloyan is representing His Holiness Aram I and the Catholicate of Cilicia at the World Economic Forum, which is taking place here from January 31 through February 4. The Forum, which is usually held in Switzerland, is taking place in New York as a show of support for the city in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks. A series of special meetings is scheduled specifically for world religious leaders and specialists, representing Catholic, Protestant, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and Hindu faiths. Archbishop Oshagan is the discussion with the Global Leaders for Tomorrow, who represent the new generation of leaders who are global in terms of their accomplishments and potential. The new generation leaders are young, but proven leaders from business, politics, the arts and civil society. Each year, the Forum's Management Board selects one hundred outstanding new- generation international leaders. Participants will discuss the new role of religion and its influence in daily life and public policy-making decisions. The Forum gives the religious leaders the opportunity to explore concerns such as world stability, biotechnology, terrorism, civil liberties and public safety. Topics that workshops and plenary sessions will focus upon What Is Sacred in Today's World, The Global Economic Outlook, Understanding Fundamentalism in its Modern Context, Middle East Outlook: New Directions? Strengthening Democracy, Defining Citizenship in an Era of Migration, and Bridging Religious Divides: The Search for Common Values, etc. The closing plenary session on February 4 will try to find a consensus beyond the dialogue and towards a global community. A visit to Ground Zero is scheduled for Sunday, February 3. Religious leaders will offer prayers in memory of the victims. Participants will recite the twenty-third Psalm in memory of the victims, representing 80 nations, and the heroic rescuers who lost their lives trying to save others.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-02,1
"His Beatitude Mesrob II, Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and All Turkey, flew to the Turkish capital city of Ankara recently for another round of meetings with government officials, concerning the amendments to be made to the law on non-Muslim minority foundations. The previous week, the Patriarch had met with His Excellency Mr. Bulent Ecevit, Prime Minister of the Republic of Turkey, who flew to the United States the following day for a meeting with President George W. Bush. In Ankara, Patriarch Mesrob met the chief representative of political parties who are represented in the National Grand Assembly of Turkey. He also met Mr. Mesut Yilmaz (Deputy Prime Minister and Head of Motherland Party), Mr. Husamettin Ozkan (Deputy Prime Minister), Mr. Nejat Arseven (State Minister in charge of Public Trusts and Foundations), Ambassador Volkan Vural (General Secretary to the European Union), and opposition leader Mr. Recai Kutan (Head of Saadet party). The Patriarch paid a courtesy visit to Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Head of the Justice and Development Party, in his office in Istanbul. The main subject brought up during the visits of the Patriarch was the amendment proposed by the State Ministry for Foundations, which seeks to revise Foundations Law No. 227. The proposed law directly concerns the Turkish- Armenian community and other non-Muslim communities in Turkey. Lawyers representing around fifty-five Armenian community foundations in Turkey have submitted to the Patriarch a legal analysis of the petition prepared by the State Ministry for Foundations. The Armenian Orthodox community is the largest non-Muslim community in Turkey and, as in the case of other non-Muslim minorities, since 1936, it has been denied the right to own new community properties. The non-Muslim citizens of Turkey have almost equal opportunity before the Turkish law in terms of personal citizens' rights; however, there are pending legal issues that must be solved in the sphere of communal rights. The Patriarch had said to the Prime Minister last week: As the government updates the law [on foundations], there is only one thing that the non-Muslim religious minorities wish. The non-Muslim foundations that have survived the Ottoman Empire should be allowed to have the legal right to receive, own and manage new immovable properties, in order for them to realize their humanitarian, social, religious, educational, health and cultural endeavors. The Patriarch had added that if this much could be achieved, then the discrimination between the Muslim and non-Muslim foundations in the Republic of Turkey would be relegated to the history books. Just as any Turkish citizen, regardless of religion, has the right to own property, the foundations established by any group of Turkish citizens which are legal personalities should enjoy the same prerogative, explains the Patriarch, and underlines, again regardless of their religion and without any artificial conditions. Patriarch Mesrob voices his hope that the amended law would not achieve anything less than this equality.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-02-02,1
"In response to Ed Bradley's segment on the January 6 telecast of 60 Minutes, Greek American lobbyists in Washington sent strong letters to Don Hewitt, the award-winning program's Executive Producer. One was sent by the American Hellenic Institute, and another was sent by the National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes. AHI Executive Director Nick Larigakis criticized Mr. Bradley's report on Greece and terrorism as disturbingly one-sided, criticized Mr. Bradley's failure to fairly include material from interviews with Greek authorities, his failure to refer to the State Department's report on Global terrorism (which commended Greece for its progress), cited that the United States and Greece have established a close working relationship over the last two years in the effort to eradicate terrorism from the Balkans, and pointed to the terrorist attacks during the 1972 Games in Munich and the 1996 Games in Atlanta. The text of Mr. Larigakis' letter is published below: Dear Mr. Hewitt, your broadcast of 60 Minutes on (January 6, 2002) showcased a disturbingly one-sided segment by co-host Ed Bradley on the threat of terrorism in Greece from the group, 17 November, and the implications for the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. While the aim of this broadcast may have been to shed light on an admittedly elusive and dangerous terrorist group, your report flagrantly sidestepped the rules of fair and unbiased journalism by giving no airtime to other sides of the story. Most notably, the story did not include... 1. The firsthand perspective of Greek authorities and their efforts to combat domestic and international terrorism, including any segments from an interview conducted by Mr. Bradley with Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. 2. The first-hand perspective of current United States officials in the State Department, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, Past US Ambassador to Greece Nick Burns, current US Ambassador to Greece Thomas J. Miller, and the State Department's Patterns of Global Terrorism - 2000 report, which states the following. The Greek Government undertook some meaningful steps to combat terrorism, especially in the wake of the Revolutionary Organization 17 November's murder of United Kingdom Defense Attaché (Stephen) Saunders in Athens, including efforts to persuade a historically skeptical public of the damage inflicted by terrorism on Greece's interests and international reputation. The government strengthened the police counter-terrorism unit, implemented a multimillion-dollar reward program, and began drafting legislation to provide a legal basis for more vigorous counter-terrorism efforts. Greek, British, and US experts cooperated closely in the still ongoing investigation of the Saunders murder. 3. The firsthand perspective of the international Olympic Committee, including IOC President Jacques Rogge's satisfaction with the Athens 2004 Organizing Committee's current security measures for safeguarding the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens. 4. The Athens Organizing Committee leadership's perspective, including their past, present and future initiatives to ensure that any and every security precaution and measure is taken to safeguard the athletes, event officials and observers from start to finish of the 2004 Olympic Games. Disappointingly, your coverage missed all of these points. Former Ambassador Thomas Niles did little about this matter during his tenure in Greece, and Wayne Merry was in the political section at the Embassy and not directly involved in this issue. Moreover, the US and Greek Governments have developed a close working relationship to fight terrorism. New cooperation agreements have been signed with the FBI, and new laws have been enacted to facilitate investigations. Former Ambassador Burns played a leading role in this effort during his years in Greece (1997-2001). Why wasn't he interviewed? As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell stated on October 2, 2001, I was very reassured by (Mr. Papandreou) about the efforts that are being made by the Greek Government to make sure that the Games go off smoothly, safely and in the truest Olympic spirit. FORMIDABLY PREPARED Athens is looking forward to peaceful Olympic Games, but it is formidably prepared for any challenge. The Greek Government has pledged $600 million for security at the games and has charted out a comprehensive plan - approved by the IOC - which will deploy 50,000 police, army, coast guard and commando units, all equipped with the latest technology. 1,000 video cameras will also monitor events from key locations. On a broader scale, cooperation with international law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Scotland Yard and other European law enforcement agencies, has intensified to prevent and deter any source of terrorism, both domestic and international (see www.greece.gr/POLITICS/International/crimefighters.stm). All of the above sources would contradict the unrealistic portrait of Greece as a terrorist haven, as painted by the sources featured on your program. In reality, Greece is a country which enjoys one of the lowest crime rates in all of the European Union. The scourge of terrorism is a universal threat. As Atlanta and Munich discovered during their Olympic Games, terrorism can strike anywhere, even IN the most prepared of venues. Tragically, the perpetrator of the Atlanta Olympic bombing, which claimed one life and injured others, still remains at-large. As a top-rated television news magazine which enjoys a large and widespread audience, we sincerely hope and request that you revisit this issue in a quest to portray a more balanced, fair and up-to-date story. Anything less calls into question the journalistic integrity of the program. Respectfully, Nick Larigakis. In their letter, NCEH leaders tell Mr. Hewitt that Mr. Bradley's report was bad journalism which is injurious to friends of America in Greece, compare the elusiveness of 17 November with the elusiveness of the Unabomber, and suggest that there is a double standard in the American media concerning Greece. They also call upon the United States to handle its friends abroad more fairly and carefully. The text of their letter follows below: Dear Mr. Hewitt, we write as Americans who are deeply concerned about the murders in Greece by the terrorist group, 17 November, and as people who know well the families of some of the victims. The 60 Minutes report on January 6 about this subject was bad journalism which excluded information essential to a full understanding of the issue. It also unfairly injured good friends of America in Greece, in both the government and private sector. There is plenty to criticize and discuss regarding the murderous actions of 17 November. Their elusiveness is a tragic and interesting story, like the case of America's own Unabomber, in which no arrests were made for 18 years (until his own brother turned him in), and that of our Atlanta Olympics bomber where no arrests have yet been made. STRAW STANDARDS The pluses and minuses of the decades-long investigation are part of the story. It was wrong to go beyond the hard data, presenting one side of rumor and speculation and holding Greece to straw standards that we ourselves can not meet, even with our innovative technology. The negative reaction in Greece to your piece has come from all parts of the political spectrum. Your story did damage not only to Greece, but also to the United States. In this new era, when a few never-do-wells with minimal pilot training and a few envelopes filled with anthrax can kill thousands of innocent Americans, devastate American industries, and injure the operations of part of our government, we can no longer afford to unnecessarily alienate any friends abroad. In this era, when the primary goals of numerous well-financed networks throughout the world are to detonate nuclear weapons, crash planes into nuclear power plants, and release a scourge of mass disease across America, international friends should be handled by all Americans more fairly and carefully. Why alienate a people who share our values so much that Greece is one of only three nations in the world, beyond the former British Empire, which chose to be our ally in every international conflict for more than 100 years? Greece was unique in its public opposition to the Nazi Holocaust. The price for Greeks upholding our values in their region is high. There were more civilians killed in Greece in World War II than all the civilians killed in Japan, after we dropped the atomic bombs. Today, Greece is the stabilizer and the political and economic power in the volatile Balkan region. Greece has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe, and it will hold the presidency of the European Union in 2003. Last year, Greece purchased more American arms than any other country and has offered its troops to us in Afghanistan. Greece is our buffer nation for the Muslim world. Greece's predominant church is the second largest within the largest religion in the world, Christianity. Its spiritual head is located in the Muslim world - the Ecumenical Patriarch resides in Istanbul, Turkey. Following September 11, the Patriarch convened, with the EU, a meeting of major religious leaders who, in turn, issued a declaration of Peaceful Collaboration among the Three Monotheistic Religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The people of Greece and their governments, from ancient through recent times, are extremely important to the United States and the western world. It was a mistake to omit from your report the words, either live or spoken by the reporter, of the capable and tough American Ambassador to Greece Thomas Miller. The Ambassador recently stated in public that there is excellent cooperation between Greece and the United States on the issue of terrorism. Ambassador Miller's background includes serving as director of the anti-terrorism office of our own Department of State, and he has had direct involvement in the American investigation of 17 November. We met with him recently about the subject of terrorism, and there is no chance he would have presented this story, as it was presented on 60 Minutes. Such one-sided reporting may make good television, but it injures the interests of America in that region. This is the case because many people in Greece perceive this unfair treatment to be the work of our country as a whole, and not just the work of 60 Minutes. As your report demonstrated, there is an inclination for people to attribute to the government of another country actions of private groups in that country. Similarly, some in Greece attribute to our government, and to us as a people, the actions of some in our private sector, like 60 Minutes. They find too coincidental the relatively recent intervention with a highly publicized independent Commission on Terrorism by a few in our government and a few with whom 60 Minutes worked. These individuals successfully pushed the independent Commission to classify Greece in a very negative category, which the Commission's thorough study could not justify, and which our government's policy strongly opposed. But, it was too late. The serious damage to our friends in Greece had been done. One-sided, injurious criticism of an important American ally has far greater consequences on all of us than was the case before September 11, 2001. This 60 Minutes presentation hurt our friends in Greece, but in the end, it will hurt us in America more. We think it is incumbent upon you to do whatever you can to repair this significant damage. Sincerely, Andrew A. Athens (World President, Concil of Hellenes Abroad), Philip Christopher (President, International Coordinating Committee - Justice for Cyprus), Andrew E. Manatos (President, NCEH).",NA,Hellenic Times,2002-01-31,1
"Fr. Adam Sztark, S.J. helped save the lives of Jewish children in Belarus during World War II by hiding them in the convent of the Sisters of the Immaculate Conception near his parish in Slonim.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has insisted that the Vatican end diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognize Beijing as the sole government of China and demanded that the Vatican needs to promise that it will not interfere in China's internal affairs, including interference under the pretext of religious activities. China served all ties with the Vatican in the early 1950s, expelling foreign priests, persecuting church leaders and forcing local Catholics to register with a state-run church which does not recognize papal authority. About five million Chinese participate in the state's patriotic church, while an estimated eight million more worship in the underground Roman Catholic Church. China continues to harass and imprison underground priests and has successfully severed the underground church from Rome's theological guidance. DIVINE MERCY STATUE ERECTED.

"VATICAN OFFICIALS FEAR TERRORISM. The plainclothes police on the lookout for pickpockets in St. Peter's Square also have a eye out for terrorists. Extra uniformed police keep watch on the crowds of pilgrims that flock daily to St. Peter's Basilica. Mail undergoes intense scrutiny, part of the reaction to alerts following the September 11 attack. Vatican officials fear that Osama bin Laden's calls for holy war bears religious hostility that may awaken historical enmities between the church and the Muslim world. PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH participated in the Warsaw Counterterrorism Conference, Nov. 6, via satellite from the White House. Presidents and top officials of 17 governments from Eastern and Central Europe gathered at Warsaw's Presidential Palace. President Aleksander Kwasniewski convened the conference to demonstrate ongoing solidarity with the United States in the struggle against international terrorism and to brainstorm initiatives the leader might pursue to bolster regional security cooperation in the concerted effort. Countries represented at the conference were: Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Ukraine, and Yugoslavia. Invited as observers were representative from the United States, Russia, Turkey, EU, UN and NATO. Francis Taylor, ambassador and coordinator for anti-terrorism, represented the United States. Tightening controls on the movement of money and people through Eastern Europe was discussed. Some terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks are believed to have traveled through Poland, and Czech Republic intelligence reported that Mohammed Atta, a leader of the hijacking atrocities, met with an Iraqi diplomat in Prague last summer. The diplomat was subsequently expelled as an intelligence agent. NUMBER OF POLISH STUDENTS RISES. The American Universities Admission Program (AUAP) announces that there were 2,432 students from Poland in the United States in 2000/2001, an increase of +10.8% over the previous year. There were 1707 Polish students in the United States in 1997. The AUAP communicates the last figures of foreign students enrollment at United States universities. Once again a new record was established with 547,684 foreign students in United States universities in 00/01. It represents an unprecedented increase of +6.4% from last year, which was already a record year. The United States is the top destination for international students. Countries sending students to the United States in the 2000/2001 academic year (with the % of yearly increase) were; China 59,939 +10.0% India 54,664 +29.1% Japan 46,497 -0.8% Korea 45,685 +10.9% Taiwan 28,566 -2.3% Canada 25,279 +7.4% Indonesia 11,625 +2.9% Thailand 11,187 +1.9% Turkey 10,983 +8.7% Mexico 8,846 +2.9% U.K. 8,139 +1.9% Malaysia 7,795 -14.1% Hong Kong 7,627 +1.1% By region Asia represented 55%-Europe 15%, Latin America 12% Middle East 7%, Africa 6%, and North America 6%-of the International student population in United States universities. Foreign students spent $11 billion dollars in tuition fees, living expenses and related costs during the academic year 2000/2001. The impact of the September 11 terrorist attack was minimal. According to a universities' survey, there was practically no resignation of foreign students in the United States. HOST FAMILIES NEEDED.

POLAND BRUSSELS URGES WARSAW TO STEP UP EU-ORIENTED EFFORT. The European Commission in its annual report praised Poland for its progress on the path toward EU membership, but also called on Warsaw to increase its efforts to reform the economy and streamline administration to be more effective in enforcing the adjusted law. The report places Poland among the front-runners for EU membership and suggests that it is realistic for Warsaw to conclude negotiations by the end of 2002 and join the EU in 2004. However, according to sources in Brussels quoted by the Polish news agency PAP, the EU recommendation for Warsaw to intensify rather than only continue reform efforts, as was the case last year, is a veiled warning in connection with Poland's falling economic growth as well as its growing budget deficit and unemployment. Of the 13 countries seeking EU membership, only Estonia, Slovenia, and Hungary escaped warnings to speed up reforms, with Brussels saying the continuation of their efforts will be sufficient to meet EU expansion deadlines.

"After reading Mr. Gunduz Aktan's cynical and deceptive article in the Turkish Daily News on January 9, 2002, which subsequently appeared on Groong's Internet Site and was primarily designed to target American readers and TARC's sympathizers, one gets the impression that he is intellectually dishonest and that he manipulates and distorts facts and realities. He follows the teachings of Ahmet Esat Uras and uses the same line of lies, fabrications, falsifications and misrepresentation. To those who are not familiar with Uras, it is important to mention that he is known as the greatest forger among the Turkish historians, dean of the Armenian Genocide deniers, and one of the direct participants in the Armenian Genocide. Renowned scholar Professor Vahakn Dadrian, in his works, exposes Uras's role in the Armenian Genocide very convincingly. Uras's main allegation is that Prior to WWI, Armenians and Turks lived in peace and harmony but, during the war, the Armenians rebelled against the Ottoman state, collaborated with the invading Russians, committed terrorism and atrocities against Turks, so the Ottoman state was forced to take self-defensive measures and issued orders for deportation and relocation, in order to keep the Armenians in safer places, far from the war zones. He asserts that there was not a shred of evidence that the Ottoman State has preplanned the relocation or was involved with Armenian deaths; it was rather a wartime response against the Armenian insurrection. COMPARING AKTAN WITH URAS Now let's review Aktan's article and compare it with Uras's teaching. In his opening remarks, Aktan tries to be fair and conciliatory with the following statements: Certain members of the Turkish public have repeatedly uttered that the 1915-1916 events were a tragedy. He continues, Most of those supporting the Turkish opinion noted that the number of Armenians who died during these events varied from between 200,000 and 600,000. The Armenians lost their houses, jobs, monuments, and lands which they called their homeland. Families were divided. Wealth diminished. It is not that impossible for the Turkish public, 30-40 percent of which immigrated from the Balkans, to feel sympathy for the Armenians. Before going into his second statement, it is important to elaborate that most of these Balkan muhajirs (refugees), who were brought to the Armenian- inhabited regions by the Ottoman government as settlers, directly participated in the Armenian massacres, under the directives of the Ottoman officials, provincial governors and mayors, as preplanned. The intent was to depopulate the region of Armenians (ethnic cleansing) and populate it with Muslim Turks (homogenization of the territory). As the annihilation of the Armenians was completed, the confiscated Armenian lands and houses were given to these settlers (the same scenario was duplicated in occupied Cyprus between 1974 and the present.) JUSTIFICATION WITHOUT PROPER EXPLANATION Now let's review what Aktan is telling his readers, based on Uras's teachings: However, there are also things that the Turkish people can never forget. Does everybody know that the Armenians have rebelled so many times since 1860 for independence in the name of reform and autonomy, as did the Balkan Christians? He continues: During WWI, Armenian rebels fought in cooperation with the Russian Army, which invaded Anatolia. Like the great forger Uras, Aktan never attempts even once to explain why it was necessary to deport the entire Armenian race, including women and children, when there were only a handful of revolutionaries, who were initially allied with the Young Turks to overthrow the bloody Red Sultan Abdulhamid's regime, and who later rebelled against the arbitrary rule of Kurdish chieftains and oppressive Ottoman officials. Without remorse, he justifies the deportation of the entire Armenian race, and justifies and rationalizes their cruel annihilation. Most Turkish historians agree that Enver Pasha's military incompetence was the real cause of the decimation of the Ottoman Eastern Army yet none connects this to the so-called Armenian insurrection (Se article in Turkish daily, Cumhuriyet, on 12/27/00 written by Turkish researcher Adli Ayter). Enver's arrogance and ineptness led his soldiers to military disaster and humiliation. His life was saved by an Armenian soldier. In fact, all Armenian recruits in the Ottoman Army fought gallantly under the banner of the Sultan to defend the Ottoman lands. On the other side of the war front, Caucasian Armenian soldiers, who were Russian citizens, fought for their Czar in defense of mother Russia. It was the destiny of the border nation of Armenia, squeezed between two mighty empires, to send their sons to fight against each other, in order to keep their loyalty to their respective governments. It is a known historical fact that Talat and Enver Pashas asked the Turkish Armenians to incite the Russian Armenians against Russia and conduct sabotage to undermine Russian control in Caucasus. When Turkish Armenian leaders advised against going to war, knowing that it would have dire consequences for Armenians living on both sides of the border. Talat and Enver accused all Armenians of disloyalty and betrayal. What happened to the 200,000 Ottoman Armenian recruits? They were all converted to labor battalions, and later exterminated in cold bloods. Shall the reader attribute Aktan's distorted views, which are based on Uras's lies and fabrications, to sheer ignorance or master manipulation and deceptive tactics to mislead his targeted readers, the Americans and TARC sympathizers? Certainly he is not there to convince Professor Dadrian or well- informed Armenian intellectuals. COUNTERING AKTAN'S DISTORTIONS It would be most appropriate to answer Aktan's distortions with quotations from Ottoman Empire's wartime allied leaders and statements from respected contemporary progressive Turkish historians, in reference to the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Based on historical accounts, scholars quote from statements made by German and Austrian officials and ambassadors to their respective governments as to what happened in the Armenian killing fields. These officials reported to Berlin and Vienna the gruesome details of the atrocities which they witnessed. Hans Freiherr Von Wangenheim, the German Ambassador, found it increasingly difficult to overlook what was going on; by the middle of June 1915, he cabled Berlin that Talat had admitted that the mass deportations were not being carried out because of military considerations alone. Von Wangenheim reported to the German Chancellor that there was no longer any doubt that the Sublime Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire. Austrian Ambassador Johann Markgraf Pallavicini reported similar accounts to the Austrian Chancellor that the Turks were exploiting the alliance, to proceed in the severest manner against the Armenians. According to Professor Dadrian, German Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Zimmermann denounced the extermination accompanying the deportations, including the forcible mass conversion to Islam of Armenian children whose parents had been killed. This space is too small to go into detail regarding the accounts of mass murders given by German and Austrian officials stationed in wartime Ottoman territories. However, one can be sure that Aktan is very familiar with them, yet he relentlessly tries to deceive his audience; he tries to acknowledge the Armenian sufferings, but he links them to the so-called Armenian insurrection, justifies Armenian atrocities and never explains why it was necessary to deport elderly men, women and children to their death. We close this argument by quoting the honest Turkish intellectual and historian, Professor Halil Berktay, Faculty Member at Istanbul Sabanci University, who specializes in 19th- and 20th-century Turkish history. He completed his master's degree at Yale and Birmingham Universities. In his lengthy interview in the Turkish daily Radikal on October 9, 2000, he stated, Ermenileri Ozel Orgut Oldurdu (Armenians were exterminated by the Special Organization - or Teskilati Mahsusa - Paramilitary Wing of the Union and Progress Committee). He candidly explains how Ittihadists preplanned and gave Armenian extermination orders. When he was asked about Armenian terrorists committing acts of violence against the Turks, he elaborated that individual acts of terrorism do not justify the extermination of the entire Armenian population. When he was under attack by Turkish nationalists, including Gunduz Aktan, another Turkish intellectual, Professor Mete Tuncay, come to his defense. Professor Tuncay is a prominent Turkish historian, the author of many publications, and a critic of Turkish intellectuals and the official government policy for not openly discussing subjects considered to be taboo. In his interview in Radikal on December 25, 2000, he stated that Professor Berktay correctly assessed and explained the events of 1915 without using the word Genocide, but his admissions are considered to be against the national interests of Turkey; therefore he was attacked. He considers this the Abdulhamid Mentality and he emphasizes that scientific facts in academic circles should be held above national interests. HONESTY PREREQUISITE FOR RECONCILIATION If Atkan had approached the 1915 events based on hones academic principles, the demise of TARC could have been prevented, since the idea of reconciliation stemmed from agreeing on facts in order to carry on honest dialogue openly. Taner Akcam elaborates on the dilemma that Turkish intellectuals are facing today in the military-controlled Turkish society. He states that it is considered to be criminal to talk about the presence of Kurds in Turkey, to question the validity of the government's version pertaining to the Armenian Genocide or talk about the presence of classes in Turkey or conduct discussion about Islamic culture. Discussion of all these topics is punishable according to Criminal Code 142-4, 163, 125 etc. He adds the fact that the destruction of the Armenians by the Ittihad was not even a debatable topic. He quotes Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, that what was done to Armenians were cowardly acts and the handwork of a tiny committee (Union and Progress Committee-Ittihad ve Terakki Komitasi) that took over the government. Ahmed Emin Yalman a prominent intellectual and journalist (Jewish by extraction and converted to Islam, called on me in Turkish) expresses bewilderment in his memoirs as to why the Ittihad Committee issued deportation orders, since he cannot understand why it was necessary to do so. One may quote numerous Turkish eyewitness accounts, statements by Ottoman- Turkish intellectuals, commoners, politicians, military officials, academics, and men of religion about how Armenians were slaughtered unprovoked, how their property and possessions were robbed, how their children, maidens and elderly were abused and tortured. I ask you, Mr. Aktan, is it a travesty for you to condemn these inhumane acts rather than to justify and rationalize them because of the revolutionary acts of a few Armenians? Naturally you cannot answer, since you as well may be prosecuted according to the aforementioned sections of The Turkish Criminal Code. Please don't quote Esat Uras or Michael Haratunian; read the proceedings of the Ottoman Court Martial, discussions in the Ottoman Parliament and Ottoman news media accounts, Takvim I Vekayi (official Ottoman government newspaper) articles and, lastly, the statements of honesty contemporary Turkish intellectuals. Then maybe we can find the right partners to give life back to TARC for honest reconciliation.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-01-19,1
"New book focuses on Kozaks and religion in Ukraine: The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine; Serhii Plokhy Cover of Dr. Serhii Plokhy's new book. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies EDMONTON - In November 2001 Oxford University Press (United Kingdom) published a book by the director of the Church Studies Program at the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, Dr. Serhii Plokhy. Titled The Cossacks and Religion in Early Modern Ukraine, publication in North America was slated for December 2001. The release of the book marked the completion of a major scholarly project of the Church Studies Program; its publication by a major academic press will undoubtedly help introduce Ukrainian history and religious tradition to broader circles of the English-reading public. The book, which discusses the role of religion in Cossack [Kozak] revolts of the late 16th and early 17th centuries, also examines the significance of the religious factor in the Khmelnytsky Uprising (1648-1654). The Ukrainian Kozaks, often compared in historical literature with the pirates of the Mediterranean and frontiersmen of the American West, constituted one of the largest Kozak Hosts in the Eurasian steppe borderland. They became known to the outside world for their wars with the Tatars, Turks, Poles and Russians. Following the successful revolt led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky in 1648, they created a polity known as the Hetmanate. Religion played a significant role in Kozak life, although it has been overlooked by modern historians. By and large the Kozaks were Orthodox Christians, and quite early in their history they adopted a religious ideology in their struggles against those of other faiths, initially the Muslim Turks and Crimean Tatars and later the Roman Catholic Poles and Lithuanians. Their acceptance of the Muscovite protectorate in 1654 was also influenced by their religious ideas. The Kozak revolts have traditionally been viewed in historiography as a species of peasant rebellion, with little ideological appeal beyond that social stratum. By examining the religious discourse of the period and the Kozak attitude toward religion, the book shows that the religious element was no less important in Kozak revolts than the social factor. Without the skillful use of religious ideas, the Kozak uprisings would never have attained their considerable proportions and attracted as many members of the nobility, clergy and townspeople into the rebel ranks as they actually did. The book breaks significant new ground in several respects. Reinterpreting Ukrainian, Polish and Russian historical sources, it shows how the confessionalization of religious life in the early modern period affected Kozak attitudes toward religion and how Kozak involvement in the religious struggle between Eastern Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism contributed to the formation not only of Ukrainian, but also Polish and Russian cultural identity. The discussion of Kozak-Jewish antagonism reveals the fundamental significance of the previously overlooked religious dimension, showing how Counter-Reformation ideas shaped the opposing perspectives of Cossack officers and rank-and-file rebels. Thus, the book does not focus narrowly on matters of faith and Church history, but treats religion as a cultural system and uses the religious perspective to shed new light on broader social questions of mentality and identity formation. Since the Kozaks themselves left no political or religious writings discussing their attitudes to religion, this book reconstructs the attitudes and mentality of the Kozak officers and rank-and-file rebels on the basis of writings of the Orthodox clergy, Kozak correspondence of the period, and reports of Polish, Muscovite and Turkish envoys to the Kozaks. Apart from an extensive study of the published sources, the book makes use of a number of previously unpublished materials from the archival and manuscript collections of Kyiv, Lviv, Moscow and St. Petersburg. Myroslav Yurkevich of CIUS participated in the preparation of the manuscript for publication. He translated into English those parts of the book that were originally written in Ukrainian, edited the text, and helped Dr. Plokhy with bibliographic research. The Rev. Dr. Iurii Mytsyk, Drs. Paul Bushkovitch, Peter Rolland, Frank Sysyn, Zenon Kohut, John-Paul Himka and Mikhail Dmitriev read the manuscript and submitted their comments and suggestions to Dr. Plokhy. Orders for the book (ISBN 0-19-924739-0) should be sent to: CWO Department, Oxford University Press, FREEPOST NH 4051, Corby, Northlands NN 189ES, United Kingdom (hard cover, 48 pounds sterling); or in North America, to: Order Department, Oxford University Press, 2001 Evance Road, Cary, NC 27513 (hard cover, $74 U.S.).

"Pope's Visit to Kazakstan and Armenia Marks 95th Abroad Shortly before the bombing began in Afghanistan, Pope John Paul II traveled to the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan, a country with a Muslim majority, located north of Afghanistan in Central Asia. It is separated from Afghanistan by Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The Vatican termed this a pastoral visit by the Pope to Kazak Catholics at the invitation of the Catholic church and the government. Although Kazakstan has good relations among its 8 million Sunni Muslims, 6 million Orthodox and 180,000 Catholics, Kazakstan's president warned that the Afghan Taliban and Osama bin Laden were sending their followers into the Kazakstan to preach Islamic fundamentalism. From Kazakstan, the Pope traveled to Armenia, another ex-Soviet republic, to celebrate the 1,700th anniversary of its conversion to Christianity. Armenians from as far away as Argentina, Australia, Greece, Cyprus, and Lebanon made the journey here to see the Pope and to participate in the anniversary celebrations. The Pope adeptly avoided controversy and offense to Armenia's Muslim neighbor, Turkey in the manner in which he handled an appearance before an eternal flame commemorating the early 20th century mass slaughter of over a million Armenians under Turkish imperial rule. John Paul II led tearful descendants of the massacred and the survivors in prayer for a healing of still open wounds. The Turkish government still denies responsibility for the deaths and the Turkish news media gave the papal visit to Armenia minimal coverage. The 81-year-old pontiff's travels to these sensitive areas is especially remarkable because of the ordeals he endured to make them. The trembling caused by Parkinson's disease makes walking, speaking and holding up his head very difficult. The trip was his 95th outside of Italy in the almost 23 years of his pontificate.","Marko, Mary Ann","Polish American Journal, National ed.",2001-12-31,1
"Archbishop Barsamian Represents Catholicos Karekin II at Ecumenical Meeting As a representative of His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, participated last week in an international interfaith meeting, organized under the auspices of the European Union and the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. We Armenians have a long ecumenical tradition and spirit that reaches back to the 12th century, said Archbishop Barsamian, who attended the conference in Brussels, Belgium, December 19 and 20. And today we find an amazing part of our mission continues to be reaching out to other churches and welcoming them when they reach out to us. The main theme of the two-day conference between leaders of monotheistic religions was religion's role in finding peace. The conference's schedule featured speakers from Christian, Jewish, and Muslim organizations. The list of religious leaders participating in the event included Mohammad Masjed Jamei of Iran; Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation in New York; Walter Cardinal Kasper of the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity; Rev. Dr. Konrad Raiser, secretary general of the World Council of Churches; George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury; and Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz, president of the Office of Religious Affairs of Turkey. His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of Cilicia, also addressed a session of the meeting. The conference's aim was to show the desire of the three religions for peaceful coexistence between their adherents in a period of radical change and great confusion, wrote His All Holiness Bartholomew I, the Ecumenical Patriarch and Archbishop of Constantinople, one of the event organizers. In this spirit, and in the view of the tragic events jeopardizing peace in the world, it is incumbent upon the enlightened leadership of the three religions to express in one voice once again the desire of God for peaceful coexistence among people.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2001-12-29,1
"Turkish Realities Today: The Turkish Film Salkim Hanimin Taneleri, and The Saga of Vartan Hotel in Van The collapse of TARC didn't come as a surprise to those who are familiar with well-known traditional Turkish political agendas, objectives and tactics. Since the inception of the idea to create this ill-fated commission, most observers familiar with two-track Turkish negotiation tactics were convinced from the beginning that it would fail. The reason is obvious: Turks were not sincere to begin with, and they agreed to form this commission to mislead pro-Armenian members of the U.S. Congress and Senate, in order to create a false impression of moderation and goodwill for public consumption. The intent was to derail the Armenian Genocide Recognition process worldwide, since it had been gaining momentum recently on the European continent. In fact, the Turks temporarily succeeded in excluding the recognition of the Armenian Genocide as a precondition for Turkey's ascendancy to the EU, while also delaying the Armenian Genocide Reaffirmation or Resolution discussion in Congress in this coming year. Realizing that the Armenian Diaspora, the main culprit behind all Genocide Resolutions worldwide, is divided and the Armenian members of the commission had no mandate, at this point, they felt that it wouldn't be necessary to take a risk and accept an independent judgment as to whether or not the 1948 UN Genocide Convention is applicable to the Armenian case. Accordingly, they abruptly retracted their initial consent and asked the independent party not to proceed, since they had already accomplished what they wanted in three different phases: THREE-PHASE PROGRAM In the first phase, they presented Armenian opponents of TARC as extremists and anti-Turkish to the American and world public opinion, in order to score points. Then they introduced pro-TARC Armenians as a moderates to the Armenian public to divide the community artificially. In the second phase, with unwarranted yet intentional statements to the effect that they are taking part in the 'Commission' to prevent Genocide Recognition', or 'they cannot accept that the Armenian case was a genocide since it never ever happened, they skillfully exploited Armenian sentiments to discredit the Armenian members of TARC, Having accomplished their mission, they proceeded to the third phase. Now, in the third phase, they are attacking the Armenian members of TARC for caving in under extremist forces and not having the patience to continue the reconciliation process. All of these phases were well planned ahead of time in a very professional manner. The Turks are well known for their selective but intentional amnesia about their past misdeeds, committed against subject nations or minority groups. The Turks firmly believe that, as a supreme race, they have undisputed and inherited rights to rule and dominate other nations and minority groups. For them it is a sign of strength, to confiscate others' lands and properties, or possess the vanquished wives and young children for assimilation. They are not only reclaiming the captive nations' history and culture, but are also presenting to the world that the national treasures, arts and architectural monuments of those civilizations have been created by them. If any foreigner or dissident Turk dares to challenge or question the validity of these official Turkish assertions, he is immediately accused of conducting an anti-Turkish, separatist, or anti-Muslim campaign. Such charges may subject the accused to fines, persecution or imprisonment. OTTOMAN MENTALITY UNCHANGED The great Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, forced the Turks to change their dress codes, including hats, and gave them a new alphabet, language, and identity. He taught them to call themselves Turk rather than Muslim or Ottoman. To stimulate their Turkish awareness, he created a new history for the Turks and marginialized the role of Islam in Turkish society, yet he totally failed to change their Ottoman mentality. At the present time, struggles among Western-educated liberal intellectual forces against conservative, traditionalist and nationalistic forces, dominated by the military, continue to reshape the domestic and political life in Turkish society. These militarist and chauvinistic forces are aiming to make Turkey a regional power and are conducting an expansionist foreign policy. In contrast to today's leadership, Ataturk, from the day he declared Turkey a republic on October 29, 1923 until his death on November 10, 1938, pursued a policy which was designed to secure Turkey's borders within the National Pact (Misak-i-Milliye), and intentionally avoided interfering with the internal affairs of others. In particular, he took extra precautions not to get involved with the affairs of other Turkic nations which were incorporated within the USSR. This policy was reshaped under reactionary President Ismet Inonu (1938-1950), in particular during WWII-(1939-1945). During this period, Turkey clandestinely supported the Nazi was efforts, preventing the Allies, the U.S. and Great Britain, to deliver military aid to beleaguered USSR through the Turkish Straits (Dardanelles and Bosporus.) Turkey anticipated that the USSR would buckle under the Third Reich's military might, and hoped that this would create an opportunity for Turkey to invade the Caucasus and Central Asia, and conclude the unfinished mission of the Ittihadists in WWI (1914-1918). CONSISTENT PATTERN OF LEADERS Later, during the years of attempted democratization (1950-1960) and after joining NATO in 1952, the leadership in Turkey tried to please the U.S. and Western governments and attempted to reconcile with Kurds and other minorities which came to an abrupt end during the government-sponsored anti-minority riots in Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara on September 6-7, 1955. Since the May 5, 1960 military coup, which was primarily designed to neutralize ascending Kurdish political power, the Turkish military has dominated Turkish politics, staging three additional coups. Because of the military's interference, Turkey's internal politics today remains murky, leading the country to financial collapse. The Turkish leadership, with Washington's encouragement, continues to pursue an aggressive and expansionist foreign policy and is prepared to project Turkish power beyond its borders dominate on oil - and natural gas-rich Caucasus and Central Asia. After this brief review, it is worthwhile to look and see how Armenians, Jews, Greeks and Kurds are doing, what lies ahead for them, how they are surviving, and how they are used for Turkish foreign policy aims. In last week's article we briefly discussed the Turkish-Armenians' plight, their daily difficulties, how man-made obstacles invoking the 1936 Turkish government ruling is preventing Armenian churches, schools, hospitals, and cultural organizations from receiving charitable donations, gifts, and aid from philanthropists, which is accelerating their institutional collapse. How the Armenian community is prevented from renovating, expanding or building onto existing church, school, hospital and cultural structures. How the assimilation process is proceeding. How the Turkish-Armenian Patriarch Mutafyan, Turkish-Armenian and Turkish-Jewish community leaders are forced to come up with statements deploring the Armenian Genocide Recognitions in foreign parliaments. Turkish sociologist Dr. Ahyan Aktar and journalist Avni Ozgurel link the Turkification process of the economy and industry under the Ittihadists in 1912-1918, with the Capital Tax passed during the term of the subsequent anti-Armenian, late Turkish President Ismet Inonu and with the government-sponsored anti-minority riots of September 6-7, 1955, which occurred under the late Prime Minister Adnan Menderes. ANTI-MINORITY MOOD AND POLICY In this article, we will glance at the prevailing anti-minority mood and policy in Turkey based on statements by the Turkish extremists, Turkish moderates, Turkish-Armenian and Turkish-Jewish community leaders. Recently, a most celebrated Turkish film, titled Salkim Hanimin Taneleri, written by state minister Yilmaz Karakoyunlu, describing minority population sufferings under the Capital Tax, which was introduced in 1942 and remained effective until 1994, not only captured the Orange Globe award at the Antalya Film Festival, but was also shown to the public in TRT-Turkish Radio and Television, causing political storms within the Turkish Parliament and news media. Directed by Tomris Giritoglu, and with a scenario prepared by Etienne Mahcupyan, it also created anti-Armenian hysteria throughout Turkey. This film is about the life of minorities in Turkey during the period of WWII. According to the Turkish nationalist and extremist forces, the cash-short Turkish treasury, in order to keep the one-million-strong Turkish armed forces on a war-ready footing, resorted to the Capital Tax on the wealthy, in this case minorities. For the purposes of this tax, their estate and business values were assessed three times more than their worth; thus, the wealthy were forced into bankruptcy, and those who were unable to pay the taxes were exiled to remote Askale in the Erzurum province in trains, like cattle, and forced to engage in forced labor breaking rocks to construct the roads. Extremist and nationalist Turks are upset that, on the screen, one Turkish officer is raping Armenian women, proclaiming that an honorable Turkish officer would never engage in such conduct. They also complain that the film is reminiscent of the Nazi concentration camps, and again proclaim that this kind of behavior could never happen in Turkey. This proves that Turks indeed have selective amnesia and are in denial. NATIONALISTS IN UPROAR OVER FILM In the Turkish Parliament, the Turkish nationalist MP, Yilmaz Karakoyun, accuses everyone involved in this film, including sponsors, authors and actors, of treason (Vatan Hainleri, Vatana Ihanet). The nationalist media, in particular, continues to attack Etienn Mahcupyan and is asking him to get the hell out of Turkey and settle in Armenia, even sarcastically suggesting that he may become elected president of Armenia. To make matters more complicated, the news media suggests that originally the Jew were asked to let the film crew make the film in a Jewish synagogue, but the Jewish Chief Rabbi declined the offer, since he felt that his community would not wish to get involved with this film project out of fear that it might rekindle anti-Semitic sentiments. Turkish nationalists continue to be upset, and they are posing the following question: How come Jewish figures in this screenplay suddenly become Armenian figures? They are pointing their finger at the Turkish-Armenian Mr. Mahcupyan and accusing him of foul play and lying. Turkish nationalist forces claim that this film is part of a conspiracy which intends to create the Armenian victim image in Turkish society, in order to prepare Turks psychologically to accept the validity of The Armenian Genocide. The Jewish community leaders first proclaim that they were never approached to have the film shot in a synagogue. Their spokesman, Rifat Bali, later changed his position and released a statement to the effect that their records didn't indicate whether or not any request was made. Another prominent Jewish leader Ishak Alaton stated that the Jewish community was approached, but the elders decided that it would create a controversy and would be harmful for the community. This shows that the Turkish people are not yet ready to face certain realities; i.e. that their nation is guilty of certain misdeeds and injustices that were inflicted on the minority population not too long ago. In particular, Turkish nationalists and conservative forces are not ready for honest discussions or honest dialogues with their victims or their survivors. They continue to maintain their Ottoman and Ittihadist mentality. VAN HOTEL SAGA The saga of Van Hotel and trials of its owner, Mr. And Mrs. Victor Bedoian, is also a vivid example that the Turkish society and Turkish leadership remains fiercely anti-Armenian. As many may already have heard, the Bedoians initially received a working permit from Ankara, rented a building in Van, and opened Vartan Carpet Showroom. Later he purchased a hotel and cafe and called it Vartan Hotel. From the beginning, the local security police and provincial governor closely monitored his moves and they began to question the motivation of this Armenian. According to Turkish law, no Armenian is permitted to purchase land or can own property in the former Armenian-inhabited Anatolian provinces, also known as the Armenian vilayets. The Turkish authorities perhaps intentionally probed to see the Armenian reaction to the Hotel Vartan episode. This reveals how the Turks continue to manipulate the Armenian minds, while at the same time reminding the Armenians that there is no future for them in Turkey. If they dream of purchasing lands or create Armenian settlements in Turkey, they should be prepared to face the Turkish law. According to the latest information, on November 22, 2001, while the Bedoians were spending the Thanksgiving holiday in America, 30 or more Turkish security police stormed the Hotel Vartan and restaurant, throwing customers and employees out and confiscating property as well as personal property of the Bedoian family. Mini 1915 events are replaying again, this time in the year 2001. Any comments from the reconciliation fans? Well, it's an educational process; some learned a long time ago, and are still learning. The only way to stimulate the Turks to reconsider their hardline approach against the Armenians is to continue securing passage of Armenian Genocide Recognition resolutions in the parliaments of all civilized nations of the world. Then the Turks will sit down and negotiate seriously.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-12-22,1
"Professor Seta B. Dadoyan of the American University of Beirut to Be the Nikit and Eleanora Ordjanian Visiting Professor in the Armenian Studies Program at Columbia University in 2002 Professor Seta B. Dadoyan has been named the Nikit and Eleanora Ordjanian Visiting Professor in the Armenian Studies Program at Columbia University in 2002. Prof. Dadoyan is a specialist in documenting and analyzing all aspects of Islamic-Armenian interaction from the 7th to the 14th centuries and has done pivotal work on developing criteria for understanding the cultural, political and philosophical penetration of each group's main tenets on the other that resulted from their interaction. On Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5:00 p.m. - 6:15 p.m. beginning January 22, Prof. Dadoyan will be teaching a graduate-level course entitled Armenians in the Islamic World: Paradigms of Cultural-Political Interaction in the Near East. Both the Medieval (8th-14th centuries) and the Modern (15th-20th centuries) Periods will be examined, and individual events in Armenian history, such as texts, historic accounts, patterns of political action, beliefs, heresies, mutual images, arts, etc., will be studied in terms of their relations to the wider context of the Islamic world. Beginning with the Arab period in Armenia (636-884), social-political dissidence and religious heresy were the first paradigms of extra-establishment interaction. The period between 1045 and 1198 saw the rise of five Muslim-Armenian powers, from Cappadocia to Egypt. In addition to the paradigm of syncretism, the theme of political interpretations of Islam by the Fatimid Armenian viziers will be examined. The interaction with cultural and doctrinal Islam in the later Medieval Period will focus on such areas of strong influence as Esoteric Islam through the Epistles of the Brethren of Purity, Islamic sciences, mysticism through the Irano-Islamic sects and urban culture and institutions such as the futuwwa and the Armenian manuks. After the 15th century, Islam was ethnified as Arab, Turkish, Iranian and thereby apoliticized. Yet cultural Islam was still the environment of Armenians. The mystique of the enemy and the exoticism of Islam mark the early ages. The nationalist era, the Armenian renaissance and the predicament of westernization in the Islamic milieu are themes that will be examined as well as the legacy of the millet system, formulae for segregation/coexistence, persistence through cultural incubators, and the folklorization of Islam in the Armenian Diaspora. The Armenian meta-system of persistence and a return to reassessments of political Islam and rethinking bridges between the cultures will be the concluding themes. Armenian-Islamic studies is a new discipline initiated by Prof. Dadoyan, and students from all branches of Near Eastern studies, from literature to philosophy, political science and arts will benefit from the methodology of examining unrecorded paradigms of cultural-political interaction in the region. This course (MDES W43430 will be open to auditors as well for a course fee of $450 people under the age of 65 and $275 for people over 65. The classes will meet in room 311 of Fairweather Hall on the Columbia campus beginning on Tuesday, January and ending on May 2, with a Spring Break March 18-22. Registration begins January 15.

"Turkish Duplicity: Turkey Is Taking over the Remaining Armenian Assets and Disregarding the Plight of the Turkish Armenians While TARC members are now asking for a third-party independent judgment on the applicability of the UN Genocide Convention to the Armenian Genocide, the Turks are quietly taking over the remaining Armenian assets in Turkey, thus making a mockery out of the Reconciliation Commission and concluding the final stage of the Genocide. The Turkish campaign, to deprive remnants of the Turkish Armenians of financial sources and deny them economic viability, as well as cultural, educational, linguistic and religious self-direction, was planned ahead of time, and this sinister strategy has continued unabated since 1915, right down to the present. Turkey is pursing a deliberate policy of denying remnants of the Turkish Armenians and their institutions, including schools, churches, hospitals, orphanages and cultural organizations, the right to acquire new financial or monetary donations, gifts or contributions from Armenian estates, philanthropic funds, or wealthy individuals. The objective is to deprive the already stressed community from essential financial resources while preventing congregation members from maintaining their-cultural, linguistic, and religious identity, and to complete the ongoing assimilation process. The Turkish stated passed a law denying the survivors of the Genocide or their lawful inheritors the right to reclaim former Armenian properties, estates, assets, bank accounts or insurance policies. The law also allows local Turkish governing bodies to exercise their powers to prohibit any Armenian settlements or acquisition of properties in the formerly Armenian-inhabited Anatolian regions. The Armenian wealth, in terms of lands, properties, estates, bank and insurance accounts, is estimated to be fifty billion dollars or more. The Turkish state uses the term Unclaimed Abandoned and Immovable properties, which, by law, after a certain extended period of time, become government property or, in most cases, are sold to wealthy Turks or Muhajirs (Turkish settlers having migrated from the Balkans) for a fraction of the cost. Thus, Turkification of the former Armenian districts inhabited by Armenians prior to the Genocide is completed. Following ethnic cleansing and confiscation of Armenian lands and properties, the Turkish state enacted numerous laws to make sure that remnants of the Armenians would never be able to rehabilitate themselves and eventually become subject to assimilation. REASSESSMENT OF POLICY The Diaspora factor, emergence of independent Armenia, victories in Karabagh, and the increasing momentum of official recognition of the Armenian Genocide forced the Ankara government to reassess its policy vis-à-vis the Armenians and chart a new course: 1) They began to force Turkish-Armenian community representatives and Patriarch to declare that they are against the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the U.S. Congress and European parliaments, and that the matter should be left to the Turkish Armenians and Turks to settle. At the same time, in order to force Turkish Armenians into final submission, the government in Ankara, through court orders, not only affirmed but reaffirmed the infamous 1936 Turkish law preventing Armenians from reclaiming former Armenian properties, estates and lands. Since 1974, the Ankara government, through court orders and decrees, has made arbitrary judicial decisions to deny Armenian communities their right to expand or improve their schools, churches, hospitals, cultural organizations and associations, whether financially, materially, structurally and institutionally, and preventing them from accepting charitable gifts, donations, or philanthropic aid, or acquire new property and space to enlarge their activities. Restrictions and obstacles artificially created by the Turkish government made even a simple reparation, the renovation process or new additions impossible. As soon as Armenian community leaders asked for permission, their request was either turned down, invoking the 1936 law, or petitions were tabled through bureaucratic red tape. 2) Considering the newly independent Armenia as a potential threat to their national security, the Turks are using the Karabagh conflict as a pretext; not only are they resorting to an economic blockade of Armenia and forming a military alliance with Georgia and Azerbaijan to tighten the noose around Armenia, but they are also trying to force Yerevan to renounce any genocide, financial and territorial claims. The Turks are proclaiming that Azerbaijan and Turkey are Two States but One Nation, setting the tone for their future relations with Armenia. This is why Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is not only demanding withdrawal of Armenian forces from Karabagh, but is claiming Azerbaijan's right to have a corridor to Nakhichevan through the Armenian territory of Meghri. 3) In order to distract world public opinion and disclaim any responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, Ankara is conducting a misinformation and anti-Armenian propaganda campaign and accusing Armenians of terrorism and committing atrocities against Turks, Kurds in the past, and now Azeris. With cynicism and under the guise of academic research, they are conducting a revisionism and propaganda blitz through the newly established Armenian Research Center in Ankara. 4) In order to impress foreign governments and legislatures, in particular in the U.S. and Europe, the Turkish government gave the most experienced diplomats authority to take part in TARC, to create an impression that they are for reconciliation. With expert diplomatic skills, they have convinced their Armenian counterparts to ask for an independent judgment on the applicability of the UN Genocide Convention to the Armenian Genocide, thus not only discrediting Armenian participants in the eyes of their own community by creating the perception that the latter too are having reservations about the validity of the genocide. Moreover, those same diplomats are also anticipating a judgment whereby the independent parties won't consider the events of 1915 as genocide, a judgment which they intend to use as future evidence in international forums to invalidate Armenian claims. With their masterful strokes, the Turks not only managed to portray TARC's Armenian opponents as extremists and hate promoters but, in public statements, are claiming that they are taking part in the reconciliation in order to prevent genocide recognition by the U.S., or they cannot accept that the 1915 events were genocide since they never happened. This way, they are also discrediting the moderate Armenians who are willingly sitting around the table with Turks, and forcing them into a compromising position too. COMMUNITY IN GREAT DANGER Turkish Armenians, descendants and orphans of the Armenian Genocide, who once were used as hostages and subjected to assimilation and humiliation, are now facing the greatest of dangers and financial collapse. Their basic human rights compromised, prohibited from acquiring financial aid, donations or gifts from Armenian donors, their cultural, educational, religious, and community organizations under threat, they are condemned to extinction without resources. The Turks are proclaiming that most properties and estates belong to the owner till death and, according to the 1936 law, they cannot be retransferred to Armenians; therefore, this material and monetary wealth now belongs to the Turkish state. Dr. Ayhan Aktar, teaching fellow in the International Studies Program at Marmara Political Science Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey wrote a lengthy and informative article in Toplumsal Tarih (Social History) in the September 1999 issue, which should be read by every Armenian. Having researched the infamous Capital Tax (Varlik Vergisi) applied discriminately to the Armenian, Jewish and Greek minorities, based on a law which was passed by the Turkish government on November 11, 1942 and which remained effective until March 15, 1944, Dr. Aktar states that this newly enacted law was nothing more than a continuation of the Union and Progress Party's policy from 1912 to 1918; i.e., to Turkify the economy, industry, agrarian sectors and all financial institutions once held by minority ethnic groups and non-Muslim population. Making an honest confession, Dr. Aktar goes further, linking the confiscation of the minority (Armenian) properties in 1912-1918 to the Capital Tax in 1942-1944, and later to the September 6-7, 1955 anti-minority riots and looting, which again. Were organized, perpetrated and executed by the Turkish state. These are a reflection of the same mentality and government policy, which is to keep wealth exclusively under the control of Muslims and Turks. Obviously, the current campaign against Turkish Armenians to deprive them of wealth and property rights is also a continuation of the same discriminatory policy. A SECOND STUDY OF THE CAPITAL TAX Like Dr. Ayhan Aktar, Mr. Avni Ozgurel, in his article published on 12/02/02 in the Turkish Radikal newspaper, honestly presents the realities of how the Capital Tax' was imposed on minorities and how Turkish President Ismet Inonu (known for his unyielding anti-Armenian sentiments) proclaimed that this kind of opportunity (alluding to WWI) may never come again, when he was advocating the passage of the Capital Tax. Yet, Dr. Aktar and Mr. Ozgurel both fail to mention the fate of the Armenian, Jewish, and Greek deportees whom, unable to pay the taxes estimated at threefold their assets, were sent to the Askale region in Erzurum, and forced to work in labor battalions, breaking rocks and constructing roads. They anticipated the death sentence at any time, which was imminent, but aborted, when Nazi German army divisions were defeated and surrendered to the Red Army in the battle of Stalingrad on February 2, 1943. Today, the fate of the remaining Turkish Armenians is not clear. The Turkish-Armenian lawyers and their Turkish attorney friends are trying to get the Turkish OSCE representative involved yet, according to the REF/RL broadcast on 12/08/01, the Turkish OSCE representative is claiming that he is not aware of the minority rights violations, even though the news hit most Turkish newspapers, including The Turkish Daily News. If the Turkish government refuses to reconcile with its Turkish-Armenian citizens, and fails to protect their citizenship, property, and individual liberty to pursue their own culture, religion and traditions, one may get skeptical about Turkish intentions to reconcile with Armenians living in the Diaspora, not to mention in Armenia and Karabagh. As the Turkish proverb says, Lafla pilaf bisherze, deniz kadar yagh benden, meaning if you want me to trust your empty assurances, I would expect you to trust my empty promises. Empty Ottoman or Turkish assurances and promises, from 1908 to the present, have never yielded any promising results.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-12-15,1
"What Has Happened to the Armenian's Conscience? On September 11, 2001 terrorists struck the World Trade Center. For President George W. Bush and with the unanimous bipartisan support of Congress, this dastardly act started a new American war against terrorism, and for freedom, democracy and justice, which gathered support from powers all over the world, including Muslim countries. This terrorism was akin to that which the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem has witnessed and endured since the eighth century. Additionally, the Armenians have survived the terrorism/tolerance/ massacre/holocaust of Sultans, deportation/holocaust/extermination by the Young Turks and the army of bandits led by Mustafa Kemal Pasha, with the support of the Allies given over to intrigue and censorship/misinformation by missionary leaders and the US State Department The entire population of the United States, including policemen, fire fighters, and ordinary people contributing to the emergency needs of rescuers and the families of the victims, poured money into special accounts, and there was great public expression over the horror of the crime, great expression of condemnation and sympathy to the survivors, but there was no public expression by any Armenian institution. New York Mayor Giuliani suggested a prayer service be held in Central Park but finally, due to the enormity of public response and considerable number of religious groups involved, the prayer service was scheduled at Yankee Stadium on Sunday, September 23. Despite no public expression by any Armenian organization, I still expected a public response from the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, which annually stages the One World Festival at St. Vartan Cathedral. THE ARMENIAN CLERGYMAN IN YANKEE STADIUM Lo and behold, an Armenian clergyman appeared in Yankee Stadium and sat reluctantly as the Jewish, Muslim, Christian and Indian prayers, songs and protests resounded all afternoon. As an aside, the Armenian archbishop was presented. Besides his being an archbishop, nothing he said registered in my mind. Among us there was talk about sending some protest to the Diocese and the Prelacy to find out whose Archbishop he was. At that prayer service, all faiths made great prayers, sang their faith, but the Armenian archbishop's appearance did not even make The Armenian Reporter Int'l's (TARI) Sept. 29 issue, which was blazing with Armenian successes: a magnificent cathedral built in Yerevan, capital of Armenia; the success of the 1700th-anniversary celebrations of the acceptance of Christianity as Armenian state religion, which spread the light of St. Gregory throughout the world and brought Pope John Paul II to Etchmiadzin and Armenia. Also there were services in Armenian churches in memory of the victims of September 11 and the heroic sacrifices at the World Trade Center site by service personnel. Not before a letter to the editor by Henry Hagopian, titled Abp. Barsamian's Absence Inexcusable, appeared in the November 3 issue of TARI, did it become evident that Archbishop Anania Arabajian was the clergyman. In that letter, mention was also made of a private prayer service in St. Vartan Cathedral on September 21, with Archbishop Arabajian presiding in Archbishop Barsamian's absence. But the Armenian services were a private matter, as all our community problems are a private matter only for Armenians, and they had no relation to the public participation in the prayer service at Yankee Stadium or elsewhere, or other public participation anywhere else. Yet we want the world to recognize the genocide we suffered; however, it has not been presented as continual terrorism by our scholars/historians who, rather, have subjected themselves to the sources of brainwashed American history. ARMENIANS AND TERRORISM The fact that we Armenians suffered terrorism for centuries and survived has been forgotten as a personal matter. Why has the Armenian conscience not risen to condemn this crime of terrorism that we suffered so much and so long? How was our conscience destroyed? Do the successes displayed in TARI have anything to do with this loss of human feeling? Or is it because the factionalism of our clergy, who subject themselves to our political organizations which, in turn, squabble with each other or within themselves, while engaging in the brutality of murder of each other and Turkish officials? Oris it because of slavery in the absence of an Armenian state since the fall of the Kingdom of Armenia in 1375? Is it because our leaders do not know the difference between preservation of culture and partisanship in the freedom of America and other countries in the Diaspora? Is it because we have not developed the sense of respecting each other and organizations respecting and cooperating with each other, like the 250 organizations which join in the Community Chest to provide relief to the community? Is this the real cause of our inability to form at least one organization which can include all factions of our political, religious and compatriotic organizations? Our conscience and the word cooperation have been destroyed by the genocide and denial and by fault finding with each other. In the aforementioned letter to the editor, Hagopian also found fault with Archbishop Barsamian for being away on an important mission in Armenia. There may be many causes for the primate of a diocese to be absent. So, isn't there a Diocesan Council to oversee and act on public incidents relating to the US? Have we so detached ourselves from American community concerns and limited our organizational activities to such an extent as to only impress Armenians and not engage Americans? CAUSES OF OUR INEFFECTIVENESS I can cite a number of incidents in which I have engaged the American people and media but that's merely a personal matter that I don't want to interject here. But the world knows - and I cannot forget - how our world was destroyed, and community and family life was split in two by the terrorist murder of Prelate Ghevont Tourian. Is it because of this fractionalized support by the wealthy that separation still persists, to the detriment of the Diaspora and Armenia having become the victim of 70 years of the anti-Soviet propaganda of the US and the West? Is this the real cause preventing us from preparing ourselves to solve the present-day problem of the depopulation of Armenia, a problem that is rearing its ugly head once again (some of us had considered Soviet Armenia as a viable state and repatriated Armenians to make up the losses of millennia)? Is it possible to revive our own conscience from the shattered community life by respecting each other and working together so we can respond to the suffering Diaspora and Armenia, as well as responding publicly to the great tragedy of terrorism at the World Trade Center, a sudden intensified terrorism, which, as I stated above, we Armenians have been suffering for millennia? Is this asking too much humility from every variety of leaders in the American community? If we cannot achieve this in the freedom of America, what right do we have to ask or expect anything different from the leaders of Armenia insofar as the depopulation of the able elements and the suffering of the remaining family members or the general dependent population are concerned? These questions should not be construed as criticism for the great relief work that is being done. But relief is not adequate and cannot displace a united enthusiastic co-operative participation in the effort to address the needs of our people still hanging on to our Motherland. Unless we rise up and reach out to our people in this heartfelt way, our conscience will not be revived to the full extent to be equal to the task of dealing with the instant and intense tragedy of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the continuing tragedy in Armenia and Karabagh. I suggest to start this revival of our conscience by holding a requiem service at St. Vartan Cathedral for all victims and heroic helpers and with the participation of all Armenian denominations, including the Prelacy of the Catholicate of Antelias (The Great House of Cilicia) and having as guests representatives of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Furthermore, until we achieve such a degree of love of each other and other religionists to do this, the Armenian youth of America cannot be expected to respect us.","Mahjoubian, Charles N",Armenian Reporter International,2001-12-15,1
"Articles on Muslim Armenians and Bedros Tourian Featured in New NAASR Journal Issue A wide range of popular and scholarly articles within the field of Armenian Studies appears in the latest issue of its Journal of Armenian Studies, published by the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research's Armenian Heritage Press. The current issue features articles covering topics on Armenian history, religion, folklore, and the arts, in addition to several book reviews and essays. LITTLE-KNOWN MUSLIM ARMENIANS The current issue of the journal (Volume VI, number 2,2000-01) includes Hemshinli: The Forgotten Black Sea Armenians by Prof. Bert Vaux of Harvard University's Department of Linguistics on the Armenian dialect spoken by the little-known Armenian group who live as Muslims on the Black Sea coast of Turkey and as Christians in Georgia. Vaux's detailed analysis of the history, current status, and unique characteristics of this dialect are of interest not only to linguistic specialists but also to anyone interested in the Armenian language and questions of Armenian identity. The Journal also includes a translation and essay by James R. Russell, Mesrob Mashdots Professor of Armenian Studies at Harvard University and a regular contributor to the Journal, entitled Bedros Tourian's Cruciform Poem and Its Antecedents. With his characteristic erudition and careful attention to fine detail, Russell provides both a skillful translation into English of a poem (never before translated into English) by one of the most important 19th-century Armenian poets and places the poem and its form in a historical context that greatly contributes to a reader's ability to appreciate Tourian's work. HISTORY AND LITERATURE Robert O. Krikorian, who is completing a Ph.D. program at Harvard, contributes a timely essay. Irreconcilable Differences? Armenian-Azerbaijani Relations in Historical Perspective. While much discussion of this topic tends to focus on the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict, Krikorian emphasizes aspects of their common history, past and present, where cooperation has occurred and stresses that the notion of inbred hostility is misplaced because, when and if cooperation has been in each group's interest, that is the path they have taken. Beth B. Cohen, a Ph.D. candidate at Clark University's Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies, compares several Armenian Genocide memoirs or novels with those of the Holocaust in her article In the Shadow of Genocide: A Comparative Analysis of Writings by the Descendents of the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide. As the generations that actually experienced these two calamities disappear, the writings of their children and grandchildren continue to explore aspects of the genocide. Cohen's essay is one of the first to compare and contrast the two cases. MEDIEVAL ART AND FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE Prof. Levon Chookaszian, holder of the UNESCO Chair of Armenian Art History at Yerevan State University, engages in close observation of a masterpiece of Cilician Armenian art in On the Portrait of Prince Levon and Princess Keran. Chookaszian extracts a great deal of information form the miniature, painted by T'oros Roslin circa 1262 A.D., about its artistic technique, the conditions under which it was produced, the cultural milieu of Cilician Armenia, and possible connections with other works of art, Armenian and non-Armenian. Marc Aram Mamigonian, NAASR's Director of Publications, adds the essay Nietzsch and the Armenian Genocide, which considers the issue of the commemoration and remembrance of the Armenian Genocide within the framework of German philosopher Friendrich Nietzsche's theories of history, especially as set forth in his essay On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life, which asserts that too much emphasis on the historical past is unhealthy to a people. RECENT BOOKS REVIEWED Several important recent works are examined in the Book Reviews section. Robert O. Krikorian reviews Edmund Herzig's The New Caucasus: Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. Dr. Joan Bamberger of Wellesley College discusses two books: Serge Bulbulian's The Fresno Armenians: History of a Diaspora Community and Arpena S. Mesrobian's Like One Family: The Armenians of Syracuse. Two memoirs are also reviewed. Dr. Barbara J. Merguerian reviews Great Need Over the Water: The Letters of Theresa Huntington Ziegler, written in the late 1890s and early 1900s from Kharpert, and edited by Stina Katchadourian. Lastly, Marc Aram Mamigonian covers Thea Halo's Not Even My Name: From a Death March in Turkey to a New Home in America, the story of a Pontic Greek woman's experiences in Turkey when the Greeks were expelled following World War I.

"Insite: Irish `Phat' Is Fine SOMETHING amazing has found its way onto the Internet but with very little hype. A five-year-old site called Phat Traffic Productions is an award-winning international features agency syndicating Irish stories worldwide and on the web. At www.phat-traffic.com the just fresh November issue is found. And it's pretty good. The team at the site develop feature articles of interest to an Irish and Irish American readership for the print and online media worldwide. They have been up and running since 1996, yet few noises have been made about a site that is really quite wonderful. The contributors are diverse and exciting, and are well versed in the art of journalism which makes the material on the site interesting and attractive. The names are already familiar to readers of Irish media, and worth a look for those who are not. Pol O Conghaile, Patrick Freyne, Anna Carey, Sam Healy and the famed Sue Leonard all write for the site. Based in Dublin, Phat Traffic sells and syndicates articles all over the world. In the new issue, O Conghaile talks to Ireland's Muslim community as they work hard to integrate their faith into a society with little tolerance. Elaine Larkin writes an article based on a 30-year-old tape recording revisiting Bloody Sunday. And for the diaspora in America, there's an article on Irish involvement in Boston's Big Dig. So you thought the Paddies were done building America? In the heart of downtown Boston, they'll beg to differ, as public relations officer Sean O'Neill says of the ferociously ambitious project, aimed at depressing Boston's Central Artery. This is the biggest show on earth right now for engineers. Up to one quarter of the projects workers are Irish, O Conghaile discovers, and they are carrying a lineage that for many began in the famine-stricken years of the 19th century. There is little left to say about this unique site other than that it is the one place decent writers should strive to end up. It is more cutting edge than your kitchen knife and it reveals to all the reason behind all those English essays. So on that note, teachers, writers, anyone really, just check it out.","Brennan, Georgina",Irish Voice,2001-12-04,1
"NYC Religious Leaders Join in Dialogue Among Civilizations with Visiting Iranian President Khatami: Abp. Khajag Barsamian among speakers in symposium at St. John the Divine Episcopal Cathedral An unusual gathering at New York's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Monday, November 12, 2001, offered fresh evidence that the international scene may be on the verge of a major re-ordering in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks. Seyed Mohammad Khatami, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, was guest of honor at a symposium titled The Role of Religion in the Dialogue Among Civilizations, convened by the World Conference on Religion and Peace. Khatami had proposed the Dialogue Among Civilizations theme used by the United Nations in its recent conference of world leaders; his presentation on November 12 was a sequel to his surprising remarks made before the UN and in newspaper interviews earlier in the week. In each of those venues, Khatami denounced bin Laden's terrorist cabal as extremist, reaffirmed his interest in moderating Iran's ruling theocracy, and expressed a qualified openness to certain Western influences. Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, was among the symposium participants on November 12. Other speakers were Fr. Leonid Kishkovsky, of the Orthodox Church in America; Dr. William Vendley, of the World Conference on Religion and Peace; Rabbi Arthur Schneier, of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation; and Bishop of New York, who hosted the gathering. (A complete transcript of the symposium is available on the Internet at www.religionsforpeace.org.) THE END OF THE WEST? Khatami's formal presentation, delivered in his native tongue with simultaneous translation, offered little in the way of Islamic teaching, but concentrated instead on a survey of Western philosophy, particularly its modern period. Dropping a rapid succession of names like Husserle, Kant, Hegel and Nietzsche, Khatami seemed at once anxious to demonstrate his erudition, and excited at the prospect of conversing with those who might have a grounding in Western thought. This catalogue of thinkers and philosophical movements - all diverging from religious thinking, and leading the West in successive phases from Rationalism to various forms of Nihilism - was offered to bolster Khatami's contention that Western civilization, with its origins in ancient Greece, is now drawing to a close. The West's success in the modern period has given birth to globalization and uniformization, even in world's most remote climes. Ironically, this does not constitute a final victory for the West, Khatami insisted, because certain cultures resist uniformization, and such resistance awakens people anew to their own, distinctive religious and cultural beliefs. Certain cultures even identify the sweep of the West as Satanic: as a corrupt, imperial civilization that threatens to engulf wholesome local cultures. Out of this conflict, Khatami suggested, the need for a dialogue of civilizations is born. Set aside the fact that Khatami is the leader of Iran, and his argument to this point, though surely debatable, is fairly orthodox (his critique of modern intellectual movements, in outline at least, could be approved by Western traditionalists). What followed were two surprising conclusions. First, Khatami placed the bin Ladenite terrorists in the camp of the Nihilists - that is, as heirs to one of the more pernicious intellectual movements of the West. Notwithstanding their self-identification as the purest representatives of Islam, the terrorist are superficial literalists...utterly incapable of understanding that, perhaps inadvertently, they are turning religion into the handmaiden of the most decadent ideologies, Khatami averred. The second surprise involved Khatami's prescription for the dialogue among civilizations. Generally, he located this in religious teachings defending human life, dignity and culture - teachings common to various religious traditions and in which Christian, Jewish, Muslim, as well as thinkers from other divine traditions, can collaborate. But Khatami seemed to find particular hope in Christian thought and social teaching. He compared the latter with the Islamic idea of ta'awon (which he translated as solidarity or co-operation to do good). But beyond this, Khatami applauded Christian thought for gallantly facing new questions emerging from the modern situation. Christian philosophy...continues to be an open and evolving intellectual discipline, and attempts to confront challenges from a Christian point of view. In its appreciation of various paths to and manifestations of truth, Christian philosophy could enter a dialogue with Muslim philosophers who, in turn, try to deal with intellectual challenges from an Islamic perspective. Whatever its merit, this is a remarkable statement coming from the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran: at the very least, relinquishing the absolutist claims of the regime's founders; at most, admitting that the Christian West - once the Great Satan - has something to teach the modern Islamic world. Khatami's concluding words echoed the same sentiment: The house of God adopts architecturally different shapes...Whether we call it a mosque, a church, a synagogue or a temple, we are only using different names. Let us all call unto God and ask Him to bestow on us a language to be understood, and a capacity to listen and understand. RESPONSE & CRITIQUE The remainder of the symposium was comprised of meditations on the Dialogue Among Civilizations theme. The moderator, Fr. Leonid Kishkovsky, offered three hallmarks of such a dialogue: Its development as a day-to-day enterprise, its conduct among people committed to the fundamentals of their respective faiths, and the spiritual motivation within each faith to purse such dialogue. Dr. William Vendley, surveying Khatami's writings, remarked on the Iranian president's discerning engagement with the West, which appreciates the latter's triumphs while acknowledging he reductive tendency of secular thinking. As secretary general for the World Conference on Religion and Peace, Dr. Vendley expressed concurrence with President Khatami's notion that a partnership of world religions must be a hallmark of the future. Religious partnership and dialogue were likewise invoked by Rabbi Arthur Schneier, and were augmented by his all for education - and re-education if needed. That need is more pressing after the September 11 attacks, according to Rabbi Schneier, as is the need for religious leaders to move beyond merely praying for benevolent outcomes, towards actually leading their people to such outcomes. Episcopal Church Bishop Marc Sisk reminded the listeners of God's abiding concern for the least, the lost and the last, adding: For too long, we have been far too willing to allow those with the loudest voices to define the religious traditions...We should take this most treasured gift from the hands of those who use it for their own hate-filled purposes. Bishop Sisk ended by thanking Khatami for the courage to begin these conversations. Amid these confident expressions of religion's potency as a beneficial political force, a note of warning was sounded by Archbishop Khajag Barsamian. After offering the shared history of Armenians and Iranians as an example of peaceful coexistence among religious groups, Archbishop Barsamian added: As we know, the opposite influence is also possible, where religious leaders incite their followers to further violence...against an ethnic, political or religious minority. He cited the 1915 Genocide and the programs in Azerbaijan as illustrations. He went on to mention the dark side of the power of religion in public life, where it simply ratifies and reinforces the worst possibilities of political rulers. Indeed, we might draw a lesson that religious bodies, to be true to themselves, have a moral duty to preserve a certain independence from the political arena. This does not mean that religious institutions and leaders should abandon political action together; but it does mean that we must always maintain the possibility - the admittedly difficult possibility - of standing as a rebuke to the worst excesses of secular ideology. However politely rendered, Archbishop Barsamian's point was a direct critique of the theocracy in the Islamic Republic of Iran - and a welcome reality check on the spirit of moral equivalence that too often prevails in the setting of interfaith dialogue. IRAN'S GORBACHEV? Another remark by Archbishop Barsamian - his suggestion that Khatami's denunciation of the terrorists might prove analogous to the first breach in the Berlin Wall - elicited a smile from the Iranian president. The question had remained unspoken but palpable throughout the proceedings: Does Seyed Mohammed Khatami envision himself as the Gorbachev of Iran? Certainly from West's perspective, an Iranian leader disposed towards moderation would be something to encourage. One of the strategies used in the 1980s to encourage Gorbachev's reforms involved enrolling him into the café society of Western elites; eventually, the Soviet premier appeared more at home there than an head of a totalitarian regime. Perhaps something similar is going on with Khatami, who (one imagines) finds it difficult to explore his interest in Husserle, Kant and Hegel among Iran's fundamentalist clerics. Perhaps the Dialogue Among Civilizations - ratified by the UN and courted in symposia - is a step along this road. It is hard to forget, however, that having engineered greater openness in his society, Gorbachev proved unable to halt the unraveling of the Soviet regime - or his own political demise. If and when that happens to Khatami, Iran will not need a dialogue among civilizations as much as it will need clarity on which one among the world's civilizations has done the most to preserve peace, ensure human dignity, and extend freedom to all its citizens. In the wake of September 11, that choice has never been more stark. Photo (Abp. Khajag Barsamian)","Zakian, C H",Armenian Reporter International,2001-12-01,1
"We Will Win the War - Will We Win the Peace? To promote world peace and the general welfare, national interest, and foreign policy of the United States through economic, financial, and other measures necessary to the maintenance of conditions abroad in which free institutions may survive and consistent with the maintenance of the strength and stability of the United States. This was the opening description of the Economic Cooperation Act of 1948, which became known as the Marshall Plan after its champion, then Secretary of State George C. Marshall. John Hume, the enduring Northern Ireland politician, was recently in Boston on a combination public/private visit. At a business breakfast, he talked about his work over the past thirty years. Hume is the widely respected Nobel Laureate who rose to prominence in the 1960s as an undeviating advocate for those who felt the weight of the Northern Ireland's use of institutional discrimination by the Protestant haves against the Catholic have-nots. He has labored for peace and justice for more than three decades in the violent mire that was Northern Ireland. Recently, he announced his retirement from the leadership of the Social Democratic and Labor Party though he says he will continue to be active in party politics. No voice has been stronger in cutting through the vituperating rhetoric of those who would preach that the North's conflict was essentially a religious struggle salted by old, misty-eyed and vague commitment to the Queen, Brian Boru, Eamonn DeValera, or King Billy. This conflict was always about jobs and money, fair and equal opportunity, and true social justice. During his recent informal address, Hume talked again about the important role American business has played in creating the economic circumstances that led directly to the platform of political stability over the past decade on which the Good Friday agreement was built. He has often asserted that crippling economic hardship and social despair have created many terrorists on both sides of the social divide. When asked at the meeting however, if the U.S. had anything to learn from such historical reality in dealing with the current world malaise, he surprisingly - if understandably, given his audience - skirted the question. He answered by emphatically focusing on the those who are responsible must first be brought to justice argument. The crowd was pleased with the response, and the subject changed quickly to business. Such are the times we live in. The wound of September 11 has not even begun to scab over in our consciousness. As I write, bombs - smart and dumb - continue to rain on Afghanistan. Winter approaches, and the horrific prospect of devastating famine and prolonged Vietnam-like insurgency looms. Anthrax has been spread and the terms plague, smallpox and salmonella weave medieval imagery into our vernacular. The issue of a draft comes up around our dinner table. My 17-year-old boy tells me: I will do whatever it takes. I will not run away. Our mail is suspect. Our nerves are shattered. Our bastions of stability and constancy in Washington have been shuttered for days at a time. Childhood itself is compromised by worry. We long for delivery from the nightmare and see no hint that it will come soon. Every morning I wake hoping something momentous and positive will greet me in the headlines of the daily paper. My fevered brain conjures up the exact wording in splendid bold type, uniform in every publication: Bin Laden and His Masterminds Captured, one reads. Al Queda Network Badly Damaged by Coalition Steps. Anthrax Terrorist Caught. Acted Alone. No Middle East Connection. New International Cooperation on Elimination of Biological Warfare Formed. Iraq Expected to Join. Coalition formed for Post-Taliban Rule of Afghanistan. UN Commits Unanimous Support. Massive Commitment of Aid Will Stave Off Famine: Heads of International Relief Agencies Agree. And then, in my fevered optimism, I blurt: Even if all this happens, what then? I am not a pacifist. I believe in a strong and carefully orchestrated military response to September 11 and its aftermath. Never should anybody associated with that shameful massacre have asleep-filled night again. Anyone who deliberately spreads disease is committing as heinous a crime as any in human history. Our country must maintain a strong and united military front in the face of such hostility. In spite of the challenge and the dangerous miasma we are getting into, I believe our might will prevail over those we seek to vanquish. But what then? Let's face it. Before September 11, we knew little of the Middle East, and we ostensibly cared less. We were a nation fed on the A.D.D. of nightly news and tabloid journalism. We were told to cheer when the Soviet Union disintegrated and Tito's iron grip on Yugoslavia was loosened only by his last breath. We watched gleefully as the Berlin Wall was ripped brick by Checkpoint Charlie brick and Germans on both sides sang for unifying freedom. In the 80's, we loved to scan past the freedom-fighter Mujahadeen articles in the paper on our way to the sports section: Hurray! Those boys were giving the Rooskies the business! Good for them! For the past quarter century or more, we basked in a world where bread and circus ruled our lives. Attention spans grew shorter as nightly news altered formats and journalistic principles were compromised. Ratings at all costs. Nuclear proliferation, the survey said, did not sell. Doctors in California discovering a pill to preserve muscle tone in women over 40 did. While the world destabilized around us, Bob from Burlington fumed about Red Sox management, Warren Buffet pied his pipes, Bill Gates pulled more strings than he had fingers, and Bill Clinton's use of altoids dominated the airwaves. In June 1947, George C. Marshall was Secretary of State. Mainland Europe, particularly its central and eastern regions, had been devastated by the war. Almost two years had passed, and the situation in many parts of Europe was getting worse. Amid such turmoil and hopelessness, communism was gaining a foothold. The menace of Stalinist Russia, so recently an ally against the larger evil of the Nazis, was now beginning to loom as the new archenemy. The U.S. knew that something had to be done to tackle the problem the very root of what they correctly identified as economic and social hopelessness. Circumstances in a post-war Afghanistan will look very different than Europe in 1947. While it is facile to think that the problems of that entire region can be solved with the stroke of a legislator's pen, some vision must be established and followed. It is obvious that the roots and fertilizer of Muslim rage are found in the most devastated regions of the Middle East. True, the most recent crop of suicide terrorists was educated and relatively well to do in comparison with the disaffected and hopeless young Palestinian strapping on the dynamite in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. But before 9/11, many of us knew little about that region of the world. Had it sunk in that only two countries in the region of the world. Had it sunk in that only two countries in the region - India and Israel - have democratically elected governments? Now, we are all totally and understandably confused as to who are the good guys and who are the bad guys, and, in our disorientation, we look to political leadership in Washington to sort it all out. This is one of the biggest challenges we have faced as a nation in the past century. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, George Santayana said. These words must be our starting clue through a deadly labyrinth. In his speech at Harvard University on June 5th, 1947, how prescient Marshall's words sound. Feel free to dream of them coming from a leader in today's Washington: I need not tell you, gentlemen, that the world situation is very serious. That must be apparent to all intelligent people. I think one difficulty is that the problem is one of such enormous complexity that the very mass of facts presented to the public by press and radio make it exceedingly difficult for the man in the street to reach a clear appraisement of the situation. Furthermore, the people of this country are distant from the troubled areas of the earth, and it is hard for them to comprehend the plight and consequent reactions of the long-suffering peoples, and the effect of those reactions on their governments in connection with our efforts to promote peace in the world. Marshall continued: Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health in the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist. Such assistance, I am convinced, must not be on a piecemeal basis as various crises develop. Any assistance that this Government may render in the future should provide a cure rather than a mere palliative. Any government that is willing to assist in the task of recovery will find full co-operation, I am sure, on the part of the United States Government. Any government which maneuvers to block the recovery of other countries cannot expect help from us. Furthermore, governments, political parties, or groups which seek to perpetuate human misery in order to profit therefrom politically or otherwise will encounter the opposition of the United States. I doubt what we recently witnessed in the IRA's historic move on decommissioning arms in Northern Ireland would have happened had not the favorable economic circumstances of the past ten years created a climate of relative social stability. Had the deprivations of the 50s and 60s continued to prevail for the North's poor Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods or should they ever return, the lines between organized crime, politics, social dysfunction, and terrorism would be far more blurred than they are today.","O'Donovan, Brian",The Boston Irish Reporter,2001-11-30,1
"Napper TANDY: Rule Made to Be Broken NEW York GAA congress delegate Seamus Dooley has welcomed this week's decision to abolish the controversial Rule 21 in Ireland. Rule 21, which barred British soldiers and the RUC from playing the Gaelic games, was overturned by a vote of 27 to 5 at the GAA national congress at the weekend. All the southern counties plus Down voted in favor of abolition while the other five northern counties voted against. I think the time has come to do this, Dooley said. I think they've done the right thing. However, he said he was disappointed that New York had not sent a delegation to vote on the matter. I was disappointed, he said, refusing to be drawn on which way the New York contingent would have voted had they been present. However, he said, I'll tell you one thing. I can't see too many British soldiers taking up the game. They'd be more used to puncturing the leather and throwing the ball back over the wall than actually playing. `Talk' Is Cheap SINN Fein leader Gerry Adams will hardly be pleased to find himself being aligned with Osama bin Laden in a new book by CNN producer Peter Bergen. Bin Laden makes the comparison himself when he rages against what he terms U.S. hypocrisy in Bergen's book, Holy War, Inc. At the same time that they (the U.S.) condemn any Muslim who calls for his rights, they receive an official from the Irish Republican Army (Gerry Adams) at the White House as a political leader, bin Laden is quoted as saying. This quote from the world's most-wanted terrorist could not have come at a worse time for Adams. The Sinn Fein spinmeisters have been tirelessly disassociating the party from any semblance of being linked to even the slightest hint of terrorism since the attacks on September 11. The attacks -- coupled with the admission that Niall Connolly, detained in Columbia on terror charges, was a Sinn Fein member -- had threatened to dry up the lucrative American cash cow. Indeed, cynics say that the subsequent IRA announcement on decommissioning only came about after Sinn Fein realized it was facing an unprecedented backlash in the U.S. Since the announcement, Adams has been basking in the warm glow of the mutual admiration club in the U.S. but seeing his name linked with that of bin Laden's may set off another round of damage control from party headquarters. Holy War, Inc. was rushed into publication after the attacks on September 11 as, apart from its subject matter, the floppy-haired Bergen is one of the few Western journalists to have actually interviewed bin Laden. Talk magazine (also see Periscope) seems to be on a mission to rile the Irish. Notwithstanding the current issue, the last issue featured a piece on today's most dangerous places in the world for the working journalist. While Colombia and Russia obviously deserved their unfortunate leaders of the pack status with 14 and seven journalists dead respectively, Ireland was, unaccountably, unaccounted for. I would have thought that being murdered by a Loyalist gang (Martin O'Hagan) would have warranted the Belfast journalist's inclusion - but not according to Talk. And no, it wasn't the usual If he's from the North, he's British, tactic either. Talk simply did not recognize O'Hagan's death -- even though he was the second journalist to be assassinated in Ireland. The first, of course, being Veronica Guerin in 1996.

"TWG Leadership Conference focuses on the future of Ukraine WASHINGTON - Despite the shock, terror, and despair that engulfed the entire country on September 11, The Washington Group's 2001 Leadership Conference went on as scheduled five weeks later on October 19-21, albeit on a more somber, and introspective tone. The theme of the conference, Ukraine: Focus on the Future, offered a way to celebrate Ukraine's 10th anniversary of independence by postulating a future much brighter than the present or past. Despite the limited flights to Washington's National Reagan Airport, and difficulties in traveling in general, over 100 people attended this year's conference, held at the Key Bridge Marriott in Rosslyn, Va. Most came from regions within a day's drive to the nation's capital, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and New York. Three die-hards flew in from Toronto. The conference began Friday evening with a reception at the Embassy of Ukraine. Among the special guests present at the reception were the former ambassador to Ukraine, William Green Miller, and his wife, Suzanne; former foreign affairs minister of Ukraine, Borys Tarasyuk; heads of various Ukrainian American organizations; as well as members of the Embassy of Ukraine staff, including Ambassador Kostyantyn Gryshchenko. At the official opening the next day, the conference chair, George Masiuk, shared with the audience the conference planners' vision of the future of Ukraine that included: good relations with the United States, integration into European institutions, a vibrant civil society with full participation open to all, and religious revival. TWG President Ihor Kotlarchuk, referring to the TWG Leadership Conference as the crown jewel of The Washington Group's activities, welcomed the participants. He, too, shared his vision for the future of Ukraine by quoting Robert Orben: We have enough who tell it like it is. We need a few who can tell it like it can be. The future for Ukraine can be politically secure and economically stable if Ukraine can integrate into European structures like the European Union and NATO. Such a move is a political and strategic necessity, Mr. Kotlarchuk said. Kostyantyn Gryshchenko, ambassador from Ukraine to the United States, gave the conference opening address. Ambassador Gryshchenko began his remarks by offering condolences to the president of the United States, the entire country, and particularly to the families of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attack. He said Ukraine joins the whole global community in its efforts to combat terrorism. In its 10 years of independence Ukraine has succeeded in building a nation, Ambassador Gryshchenko said. A foundation for a civil society has been laid, and progress has been made toward economic recovery. Echoing President George W. Bush's remarks that a stable Europe must include Ukraine, Ambassador Gryshchenko said he is optimistic about Ukraine's progress for integration into the European structure. He concluded by saying support of the Ukrainian American community is vital for Ukraine's future, and such a partnership is possible only when Ukraine itself continues to reform. Before coming to the United States, Ambassador Gryshchenko served as the ambassador from Ukraine to the Kingdom of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. He was also Ukraine's head of mission to NATO and the permanent representative of Ukraine to the OPCW in Brussels. Ambassador Gryshchenko was decorated with the Order of Merit by President Leonid Kuchma in 1998. The first panel, United States Policy Toward Ukraine, was moderated by Mr. Masiuk. The first speaker was Dr. W. Gregory Perett, the director of the Office of Ukrainian, Moldovan and Belarusian Affairs at the Department of State, who has a long career as a foreign service officer, serving overseas as well as in a variety of positions in the department. Dr. Perrett, who holds a Ph.D. in modern European history from Stanford University, outlined some of the key objectives of U.S. policy toward Ukraine. He stressed that key among them is a stable, independent, prosperous Ukraine, tied to the West. The door to Europe is through reform, he said. To be in Europe, Ukraine must be like Europe, Dr. Perrett said. He pointed out examples where Ukraine has already taken positive steps to integrate into Europe, for instance, the closing of the Chornobyl nuclear power station and the withdrawal of its nuclear weapons to Russia. He specifically referred to the leadership role Ukraine played in the creation of the GUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Moldova) cooperative organization. There are, however, many challenges that Ukraine still faces, recognizing and protecting media freedom, adhering to the rule of law and creating an independent judiciary. He said the upcoming March parliamentary elections present an opportunity and a challenge, and cautions that the reform agenda is still uneven. He said the problem is with the preparation, intimidation and harassments that occur before the elections, not with the election process itself. The second speaker was Stacy Closson, the former Ukraine country manager in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Policy. Ms. Closson traced the bilateral military-defense cooperation between the United States and Ukraine to date, which encompasses over 100 bilateral military exchanges. Noting that the Pentagon provided a $48 million assistance package to the Ukrainian military, she talked about the major objectives of the U.S.-Ukraine defense cooperation. These include controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction, developing a rational military policy in Ukraine and establishing civilian control of the Ukrainian military, as well as the questions about whether Ukraine could, should, and would become a NATO member. Ms. Closson described two new important projects that will enable the Ukrainian armed forces to face the strategic challenges of the 21st century. The United States is working with the Ukrainian military to develop goals in its military doctrine, and to develop a road map to overhaul its defense establishment. If these are successful, the Ukrainian military will be on par with the best fighting forces in the world. Christine Lucyk, senior policy advisor in the U.S. Commerce Department, talked about expanding U.S.-Ukrainian commercial relations. Ukraine has the lowest level of foreign per capita investment in the region, and with good reason, according to Ms. Lucyk. Because Ukraine lacks a legal foundation to do business, Western companies are reluctant to enter the Ukrainian market, she said. To improve the situation, certain policies need to be changed, and a legal foundation for business and the protection of intellectual property rights must be established. Ukraine is listed as the principal offender of pirating CDs and software in the world, she added. Ms. Lucyk concluded by listing the steps necessary to change the very negative business perceptions of Ukraine: by entering into the World Trade Organization; instituting legal parameters for doing business, and transparent tax codes; reforming the land code and energy sectors, and passing intellectual property laws. Unfortunately, there are no trade missions planned for Ukraine at the present time because the atmosphere in Ukraine has not been conducive to business, Ms. Lucyk said. By the same token, the attitudes of Ukrainian entities toward legal business practices are still very ambiguous. It was impossible to become wealthy in Ukraine without violating the laws, Ms. Lucyk said. The fourth speaker on this panel was Lydia Wolansky, a last-minute substitute for Michael Pyszyczymuka, the section chief of the International Operations Section at the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Pyszyczymuka was detained at his office and was unable to participate in the panel. Ms. Wolansky, the publisher of the Eastern Economist, was not only an informative and dynamic speaker, but entertaining as well. Having spent many years in Ukraine, she provided an overview of the current situation in Ukraine, hitting upon issues in economics, commerce, trade, as well as the defense and military sectors. She said the economic situation in Ukraine is improving, but it is necessary to keep reform moving under the current administration. She said the powers that be need a good reason to change, but that they have no incentive to try anything different now because they're comfortable with the way things are. Change, however, is inevitable, and it is occurring, most notably in the agricultural sector. Ms. Wolansky said Ukrainians are finally beginning to understand that Ukraine is part of a world community, and needs to have good relations with the United States and with other countries, including Russia. But there is much more for Ukraine to learn, she observed. A lively question and answer period followed, after which the participants retreated for lunch to the elegant roof-top dining room, which had both a delicious Italian buffet and a splendid view of the Washington monuments and the Potomac River. The luncheon speaker, Borys Tarasyuk, Ukraine's former minister for foreign affairs, and currently the Peter Jacyk Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard University, provided some powerful observations. Mr. Tarasyuk called the foreign policy of Ukraine one of the most successful spheres in the development of an independent Ukraine. It seems odd that before 1991 no one paid attention to the 15 independent republics comprising the Soviet Union. But the emergence of an independent Ukraine altered the geographic and political landscape of Europe, as Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski so eloquently stated. Mr. Tarasyuk then highlighted some of the foreign policy successes of Ukraine. (See sidebar for more details on Mr. Tarasyuk's presentation.) The first afternoon panel, the Ambassadors' Forum, addressed the question of Ukraine's integration into the European community by exploring the experiences of the Republic of Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Bulgaria in pursuing membership in the European Union and NATO. The panel moderator was Dr. Nadia Diuk. The first guest speaker was Ambassador Geza Jeszenszky of Hungary. Initially, Hungary bid for entry into the European Union only, but events in the Balkans made membership in a military alliance such as NATO more urgent. Ambassador Jeszenszky praised the efforts of the Hungarian-American coalition that lobbied the U.S. Senate for Hungary's admission into NATO. He also recognized Hungary's friendship with Ukraine and Ukraine's struggle for independence. He concluded by saying he hopes someday Ukraine will also become a member of NATO and the European Union. The next speaker was Ambassador Martin Butora of Slovakia, who explained that the Slovak Republic is not yet a member of NATO, but is actively bidding for membership. Presently, only 50 percent of the population supports joining NATO, while the rest believe that Slovakia can ride on the security coattails of Hungary and the Czech Republic, both recently admitted to NATO. Ambassador Butora responded to this by saying: If you want to enjoy the security, you must pay for it to be taken seriously. He offered some suggestions for Ukraine to further integrate herself into Europe. For instance, Ukraine can show solidarity with other countries by joining the anti-terrorist coalition. The attack of September 11 was an attack on all of us, Ambassador Butora said. Relations between Ukraine and Slovakia have improved recently, he noted. The two countries are pursuing a business venture in the energy sector, and Slovakia's tough visa policy toward Ukraine has been softened. Ukraine has proved herself to be a steady friend to Slovakia, Ambassador Butora stated. The third speaker, Ambassador Philip Dimitrov of Bulgaria said his country also is aiming for NATO and European Union membership, although in a much more subdued manner. The recent terrorist attacks on New York and Washington added additional ammunition for joining NATO, and NATO's anti-terrorist effort is becoming even more significant, according to the ambassador. Clearly, the benefits of NATO membership are becoming apparent to countries like Bulgaria, he said. Ambassador Dimitrov admitted, however, that much work needs to be done in order for Bulgaria to become a member of the European-Atlantic Alliance. He said he is optimistic that in the future Bulgaria would succeed. He also commented that relations between Bulgaria and Ukraine are pretty good. The final guest speaker on this panel was Ambassador Gryshchenko, who began by stating that, Ukraine sees itself as a European nation. We are in Europe. We need not have to prove it. He went on to say that the first 10 years of Ukraine's independence were devoted to its own nation-building, establishing a civil society and economic development. He said he believes that Ukraine has finished this first stage, but we are not there yet, he said. Although Ukraine has not officially stated that it is interested in joining NATO, it does have a special relationship with NATO secured by a charter. Ambassador Gryshchenko further stated that Russia's interest in joining NATO may be a harbinger of good things to come. Ukraine continues to strive to make its government and military structure compatible with European and American standards, and plays an important role in world affairs as a peacekeeper. In addition, Ukraine has played a key role at the United Nations Security Council, and opened its airspace to help America in facing the challenge of terrorism. Ambassador Gryshchenko closed by saying, We need to help our own people to be successful. We do not foreclose on opportunities except on anything that would jeopardize our national security. Many years ago, the legendary sociologist Margaret Mead insisted that, in an agricultural country, it is women who control the economics of that country, for they are the controllers of the food. During the 2000 TWG Conference, the third panel, Women and Ukrainian Society: NGOs, Community Groups and Government Leadership, moderated by Robert De Lossa, and co-sponsored by the American Association for Ukrainian Studies, examined the role of women in Ukrainian society. Iryna Kurowyckyj, president of the Ukrainian National Women's League of America Inc., which conducts a multitude of social service programs for women in Ukraine, described the dire conditions of women in Ukraine today. In 1989, 33 percent of the parliamentarians were women, but by 1993, women held only 3.5 percent of the seats in Parliament. Only about 5 percent of the managers and directors of large institutions, enterprises and organizations are women. At the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 42 percent of the staff is female, but only 12.4 percent are working in the prestigious diplomatic corps. In 1995, there were 326 diplomats in foreign missions and only 3 percent of these were women. Women in Ukraine are better than equal in education, but less than equal in opportunity, Ms. Kurowycky concluded. Vera Andrushkiw, the project director for the Community Partnerships Project of the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, is responsible for its sister cities program that matches Ukrainian and American cities. Ms. Andrushkiw said that women have played a major role and have been in the forefront in developing and strengthening Ukrainian independence and statehood on both sides of the Atlantic. From the very beginning, women played key roles in various aspects of developing a civil society and addressing Ukraine's social, educational and cultural needs. Ukrainian women were always and still are in the forefront of developing all the aspects of an independent society from charities to museums and educational programs for the young. Ukrainian women have done a spectacular job in these arenas, Ms. Andrushkiw continued. Women make up more than half of Ukraine's population. Most of them are well educated, but they suffer discrimination in the labor market, Ms. Andrushkiw reported. They constitute over 70 percent of the unemployed. The income level of women is one-third less than men in Ukraine, and this gap is increasing. She also cited other statistics: More than two-thirds (69 percent) of the white-collar labor force in Ukraine are women. However, only 5 percent of women hold positions of authority as managers, directors or heads of departments. (U.N. Ukrainian Human Development Report 1995). Alexandra Hrycak, a sociologist who has worked extensively in Ukraine, explained that Ukraine's current economic climate is dismal, particularly for women, she explained. One consequence is that women are now more likely than men to look abroad for economic opportunities. Once abroad, they often work in poorly paid menial jobs that native women shun. Although women go abroad temporarily, mainly to accumulate cash to send home to their family, many will undoubtedly not return, unless domestic opportunities improve. This has often led to the trafficking of women. One way to improve the status of Ukraine is to empower women politically. Because of their long-standing exclusion from genuine political authority, women in post-Soviet Ukraine also have relatively little agenda-setting power, Ms. Hrycak said. Amy Heyden, a director of Winrock International, focused more on how women's NGOs are integral players in the development of Ukrainian society, acting as catalysts for change in their communities. Ms. Winrock started working with women's NGOs in Ukraine in 1994, assisting in the organization of a coalition of women's NGOs called the NIS-US Women's Consortium. She is presently working to implement three projects in partnership with Ukrainian women's organizations. The first of these is a Trafficking Prevention Project funded by USAID to establish Women for Women Centers in Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kherson, Rivne, Lviv and Zhytomyr. These centers provide job skills, entrepreneurship and crisis prevention services for women in their community. The second project is the Women's Economic Empowerment Project, also funded by USAID. This project addresses the needs of Ukrainian women for entrepreneurship training, self-employment and access to financing. In partnership with women's NGOs, Women's Business Support Centers were established in five oblasts: Chernihiv, Donetsk, Ivano-Frankivsk, Kharkiv and Mykolaiv. The third project, Community Responses to Domestic Violence and Trafficking in Women, focuses on improving the way communities respond to domestic violence and trafficking, in particular how the criminal justice system responds to these social problems. Ms. Heyden is working with women's NGOs in Dnipropetrovsk, Luhansk and Lviv to provide training for law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, medical professionals and other community organizations on how to better address domestic violence and trafficking. After a very intensive, but stimulating day, the conference participants returned in the evening for dancing and libations and to honor Maj. Gen. Nicholas Krawciw, U.S. Army (ret.), this year's recipient of the TWG Award. (See sidebar for more information about Gen. Krawciw.) The featured performers at the Leadership Conference brunch on Sunday were singer Marianna Vynnytska and keyboardist/percussionist and member of Braty Blooz, Andrij Vintsersky. Braty Blooz won several grand prizes at festivals in Ukraine, including Chervona Ruta in 1993. In their very first appearance together, Ms. Vynnytska, who was a member of the Kyiv Burlesque ensemble, and is part of a jazz trio with pianist Volodymyr Vynnytsky and renowned composer Myroslav Skoryk, and Mr. Vintsersky performed numerous romantic love songs written by Myroslav Skoryk. In addition, Ms. Vynnytska performed her own composition as well as a song written by Mr. Vintsersky, who is also a music arranger and composer of jazz/rock. Their performance and the cabaret atmosphere delighted the audience. The 2001 TWG Leadership Conference concluded with a presentation by the Rev. Dr. Borys Gudziak, rector of the Lviv Theological Academy. The Rev. Gudziak worked with the Vatican in the preparation and organization of the visit of Pope John Paul II to Ukraine. This visit was a tough one for the pope, the Rev. Gudziak said. The pontiff had been trying for more than a decade to visit Ukraine, so when the opportunity arrived he prepared for this trip intensely. Upon his arrival in Ukraine, Pope John Paul II said Finally, with deep joy I've been able to kiss the beloved soil of Ukraine. Thank God. During his 11 major addresses in Ukraine, all in excellent Ukrainian, the pope was able to lift the spirit of Ukrainians like no one else has been able to do, related the Rev. Gudziak. He spoke affectionately and emotionally about Ukraine's suffering and its tragic history. In his address to the young people of Ukraine, many of who stood in the pouring rain in the muddy fields of Sykhiv for 10 hours, the pope spoke directly to them, saying that he knew their frustrations, anxieties and their disillusionment. He offered the young people hope, and a vision of the future that they could relate to. The same electric effect was felt by the 1 million gathered outside of Lviv for divine liturgy. This was the biggest liturgy in the Byzantine tradition, the Rev. Gudziak said. People walked about six inches above ground for weeks after the papal visit - such was the joy and happiness people felt. This was truly one of the most meaningful trips for the holy father, the Rev. Gudziak commented. Besides meeting with the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, the holy father met with leaders of many faiths, including Jewish, Muslim and Orthodox. Pope John Paul II also blessed the cornerstones of several buildings, including the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.

"Pastoral Repercussions of WTC Terrorist Attack Is Main Topic of Discussion at Meeting of U.S. Oriental Orthodox Churches St. Mark's Syrian Orthodox Church in Teaneck, NJ, was the host of a meeting of the Standing Conference of the Oriental Orthodox Churches of America, which took place Thursday, October 4, 2001. The meeting began with a special service of prayer in memory of the victims of the terrorist attacks against our country and people on September 11, 2001. The day's agenda covered a variety of subjects and issues that were of interest and concern to the five sister churches that make up the Oriental Orthodox church in America. Among the topics discussed were the stand of the Orthodox church on certain moral issues facing the American can community; membership status and active involvement in the National Council of Churches; joint youth programs; and the con-celebration of a hierarchical divine liturgy. The main theme of discussion, however, was the recent terrorist attacks on New York City, Washington, and Pennsylvania, and the church's response to the tragedy and its role in supporting and comforting the families of the victims. Having discussed the various contributions and efforts that each of the oriental churches is doing to help in this time of grief and pain, the clergy agreed on the need for the Oriental Orthodox church to make a statement regarding the recent terrorist attacks. The Oriental Orthodox Churches are unique in that many of the faithful of these churches in the United States are originally from countries which, today, are considered terrorism-breeding countries. Some of them have experienced terrorism themselves for years in their countries of origin, and others still have relatives and friends in these countries. Participants emphasized the importance of educating the American public and the media regarding Christian minorities in these countries, who are usually mistaken for the Muslim majority. The encyclical of His Holiness Pope Shenouda III, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark regarding the tragedy was also circulated. Faith can never accept such terrorism, states the Pope of Alexandria; rather, it condemns its perpetrators and all those who assisted them in planning and/or executing such acts. Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, chaired the meeting, and presided over the special service. Present at the meeting were Archbishop Mar Nicholovos Zachariah, Primate of the Malankara Indian Orthodox Church; Bishop David, Primate of the Coptic Orthodox Church of America; and thirteen clergy representing the Armenian, Coptic, Ethiopian, Malankara, and Syriac Orthodox churches.","Hovhanessian, Vahan",Armenian Reporter International,2001-11-24,1
"Abp. Barsamian's Remarks During Dialogue Among Civilizations What follows is the text of remarks delivered by Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America, during a symposium on The Role of Religion in the Dialogue Among Civilizations. The gathering, convened by the World Conference on Religion and Peace, took place at the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine, in New York City, on Monday, November 12, 2001. The principal speaker on the occasion was President Seyed Mohammad Khatami, leader of the Islamic government of Iran, who was visiting New York to attend a conference at the United Nations. Among other symposium speakers were Fr. Leonid Kishkovsky, of the Orthodox Church in of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation; and Bishop Mark Sisk, the Episcopal Bishop of New York, who hosted the gathering. (A full account of the symposium is forthcoming as a separate release.) THE POSSIBILITY FOR RELIGIOUS INTERVENTION IN SITUATIONS OF POTENTIAL AND ACTUAL ETHNIC/POLITICAL CONFLICT I want to express my gratitude for the opportunity to address this gathering today. I also want to acknowledge with approval President Khatami's willingness to take part in this dialogue, and in the week's events generally. This discussion would have been very different a mere three months ago, if it was able to take place at all. All of our deliberations today and hereafter necessarily occur under the shadow of the tragic events of September 11. It is important to note, however, that even prior to that infamous day, it was not uncommon for representatives of religious groups in America to meet and share ideas about common concerns regarding religious and ethical issues in the modern world. Far from curtailing such gatherings, September 11 obligated the nation's religious leaders - particularly here in New York - to meet even more frequently; it provided an occasion to put the teachings of our respective religions about peaceful co-existence - a teaching common to many religions - into actual practice. These efforts helped to hearten the people of New York as they courageously confronted the great misfortune visited upon them. In addition, the cooperation between religious figures and the municipal authorities helped to establish order in the confusion of the disaster, and confirmed the city's resolution to rebuild in its aftermath. These efforts were a great support for the municipal authorities, and the result is evident: Today, New Yorkers stand more united as ever, and are planning to restore the vitality of their city. I cite these events, still fresh in our memory, to show how peaceful coexistence among different religious groups in New York and in America is not only possible, but is a positive and productive force in society. The American example is not the only one, however, and history can provide alternate models for a future dialogue among world religions. As the Primate of the [Eastern Diocese of the] Armenian Church of the Eastern United States, I wish to present the modest example of my own Armenian people, who have lived side by side with the people of Iran for over three thousands years. This year marks the 1700th anniversary of the conversion of the Armenian nation to the Christian faith. This means that Armenians have coexisted first with the Zoroastrian and, later, with Muslim Iranians for over a millennium and a half. That time includes long periods when Armenia proper existed under Iranian rule. The relationship has not always been one of ease and toleration for the Armenian minority; but surely the long duration of the relationship, and the relative security of Iran's Armenian communities over much of the period, hold lessons for our pursuit of inter-religious dialogue today. I propose to select some episodes from our history by way of illustration. In A.D. 449, Iran's king of kings tried to force Zoroastrianism on the Armenians and the other Christian nations of the Caucasus. This policy led the Christian nations to open rebellion. The imperial government of Iran soon realized, however, that freedom of worship was a basic right it could not deny to her subjects. In 484 a new king of kings signed a treaty with the Armenians, granting them freedom to practice their faith: one of the world's earliest examples of a legally sanctioned freedom of worship. The large Iranian-Armenian community of our own time traces its origins to the beginning of the 17th century, during the period of Shah Abbas the Great, who resettled thousands of Christian Armenians in various parts of his kingdom and became their great friend and benefactor. The community in Iran prospered greatly and played a major role in modern Armenian history. While it is true that in the past there were destructive incidents involving individuals and small groups, it is also true that Armenians coexisted with Muslim Iranians for 1300 years and were fully able to maintain their Armenian as well as Christian identities. One of the most important lessons to be drawn from the experience of Iran and Armenia is the role that Armenian Christian clergymen played in promoting peace and friendship between hostile kingdom with different ethnic origins and religious backgrounds. History attests to several high-ranking Armenian clergymen who served as delegates, messengers or ambassadors of goodwill and peace between the Iranian and Byzantine empires. Another worthy example of clerical involvement took place in 1904/1905, during the Armenian-Tatar conflicts in Tsarist Transcaucasia. The Supreme Patriarch Mkrtitch Khrimian met with the Sheikh ul Islam at the monastery of Holy Etchmiadzin, and a telegram bearing the signatures of both men was sent to all the towns and cities in Transcaucasia, urging the people to end the hostilities and seek peace. Later, Sheikh ul Islam and the Armenian prelate of Azerbaijan traveled together from town to town, in order to restrain the Christian and Muslim populations from further violence. All of the examples cited here indicate that religious leaders can intervene in dangerous situations, and that they have had some success in averting violence in the past. As we know, the opposite influence is also possible, where religious leaders incite their followers to further violence, thus escalating violence between groups or against an ethnic, political or religious minority. Tragically, the Armenians have been on the receiving end of this kind of intolerance. It will briefly cite only two examples: the Genocide of the Armenians, committed in 1915 by the Ottoman Turks; and the assault against Armenians living in Soviet Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabagh, which began in the late 1980s. In both cases, clerics of the majority population preached against the Armenian Christian minority - lending religious authority to violence that was, to a great extent, a secular political policy of state. In such alliances with secular ideologies and nationalist movements, we see the dark side of the power of religion in public life, where it simply ratifies and reinforces the worst possibilities of political rulers. Indeed, we might draw a lesson that religious bodies, to be true to themselves, have a moral duty to preserve a certain independence from the political arena. This does not mean that religious institutions and leaders should abandon political action altogether; but it does mean that we must always maintain the possibility - the admittedly difficult possibility - of standing as a rebuke to the worst excesses of secular ideology. Whatever our tradition, our guiding light must be the highest principles of divine command and revelation. We have faith that no serious religion would ever give approval to violence, oppression or the extermination of human beings. Today, of course, we are facing just such a dangerous situation, as religious loyalties are misused to support violent and unholy causes. We attribute this misuse of religion to the growing influence of modern secularism, which has a tendency to dismiss God from human affairs. To conclude, let me repeat that as a religious leader, I welcome warmly President Khatami's proposal for a dialogue among civilizations, and agree with our brother clergy that the religions of the world have an important role to play in this matter. Since the purpose of religion is to put man in the right relationship with God, with nature, with other human beings and with himself, its misuse will promote not only a clash of cultures and religions, but also turn the world into a living nightmare. We still have an opportunity to restrain humanity from such a destiny. It is ironic - or then again, perhaps it is the will of God - that the unspeakable tragedy of September 11 has brought out the possibility for breaking down walls in a way we thought impossible even three months ago. It is my fervent prayer that President Khatami's recent denunciation of the terrorists will prove to be a first step in tearing down one of those walls, which like the Berlin Wall once seemed so impenetrable. In the end, as religious leaders, we serve as humble intermediaries to our peoples; our actions and attitudes can and do influence our flocks, and God's judgment on us will be terrible if fail to lead them, or if we mislead them in any way. May God help us all to set a proper example to our respective faithful, so that they, too, may turn to dialogue instead of quarrel, to peace instead of war. Thank you.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2001-11-24,1
"THE UKRAINIAN WEEKLY: The information war It has been widely reported that, though the United States may be winning the war in Afghanistan, it is losing the information war in the Muslim world. Perhaps the most unambiguous affirmation of that fact came when President George W. Bush said: How do I respond when I see that in some Islamic countries there is a vitriolic hatred of America? I'll tell you how I respond: I'm amazed that there is such a misunderstanding of what our country is about. We've got to do a better job of making our case. Indeed. Lately - since the end of the Cold War - the United States has been neglecting the proverbial battle for hearts and minds around the globe. In some parts of the world the need for that message has never been clearer than today, now that, as commentators worldwide have repeatedly emphasized, everything has changed in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States. America's cause was not served and its case was not made around the world because of budget slashing in the past few years that decimated its radios, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which served as surrogate stations providing news coverage unavailable in listeners' countries, and the Voice of America, which serves as the official radio station of the United States. For example, the VOA in recent years had closed most of its services in the languages spoken in Afghanistan. Back in 1996, millionaire publisher and former presidential candidate Malcolm Steve Forbes Jr., who had been the chairman of the Board for International Broadcasting, which oversaw the work of RFE/RL as well as the Voice of America, commented that the importance of the radios in the battle of ideas lay in the fact that they are cheap - $50 million won't buy you very much military equipment - and they engage and interact with the audience every day. Getting rid of them now would be a penny wise and pound foolish move, he underscored. Obviously, he and other advocates of the radios (including this newspaper) were right. Now there is talk of expanding U.S. broadcasting to the Muslim world, and hiring Arab Americans and Afghan Americans, for example, to get the U.S. message out to important international audiences that have been ignored. There are also serious suggestions that the United States should reverse course as regards its information services. Instead of downsizing them, our country should expand their offerings and their reach. As recent events have shown, U.S. broadcasters and other media still have an important and singular role to play in the post-Cold War world. If the U.S. wants its message to audiences around the world to be accessible, coherent and consistent, it must re-establish the prominent role of its radios. There's no doubt that funding for such public diplomacy would be money well spent.",NA,Ukrainian Weekly,2001-11-18,1
"Turkey Will Never Recognize Genocide, Says TARC Member: Krikorian, Sanberk Participate in Turkish Conference, Discuss Armeno-Turkish Issues Turkey will never ever recognize the [Armenian] Genocide for the simple reason that it didn't happen, explained Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission (TARC) member Ozdem Sanberk during a discussion session at the 22nd annual Assembly of Turkish American Association (ATAA) convention held last week in Washington, DC. Also participating in the convention and the discussion group was TARC member and Armenian Assembly of America chairman Van Z. Krikorian. The two members of the so-called commission participated at the ATAA convention to provide an overview of TARC, which was formed in July of this year, sending shock waves and eliciting protest in the Armenian-American community, as well as in Armenia and other communities around the world. In his opening remarks to convention attendees, Sanberk, who is a career diplomat in Turkey with a long record of Genocide denial activities, sought to diminish the gravity of the Armenian experience during the Genocide perpetrated by Ottoman Turkey, explaining that Armenian and Greek refugees from Anatolia to Greece, Lebanon and other corners of the collapsing empire kept the story of their suffering alive as a kind of culture. They did not want to forget these sufferings which they went through. Rather, they sought to forge an identity from these painful experiences. They became victims of their own pain. Meanwhile, Muslim subjects of the Ottoman [empire], fleeing from Crete or Bulgaria, Macedonian, Albania or Greece to Anatolia wanted to leave their past behind and to build a new life. In discussing the various aspects of activity undertaken by the commission, the two members seemed to agree that Turkey's responsibility and accountability in the Armenian Genocide would not be an issue of discussion or a point of departure for reconciliation. Krikorian maintained that political efforts of Genocide affirmation have no place within the context of the commission discussions. To an audience question on the how reconciliation is possible as long as Armenians promote genocide and ethnic cleansing idea around the world and in the US, Krikorian said, I understood the question to be referring to efforts at genocide reaffirmation, our efforts here in the United States, our efforts in Europe, efforts around the world. And I want to disassociate the two. To the same question Sanberk added, ...we must get ourselves accustomed to talk a little more about reconciliation, affection, love, solidarity...these are words that must be in our agenda. It is important to note that, month, the European Union omitted the recognition of the Armenian Genocide in a report documenting progress in Turkey's accession into the EU, citing TARC and their statements as a Motivator in this move. Responding to a question on a planned Genocide museum in Washington, Sanberk explained, As far as I am concerned, of course, this is not the way forward...We have always defended the thesis that this is not the way for us...but this is their decision and we will always have our own view, which we will always express.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2001-11-17,1
"It's All in the Interpretation Since the September 11th attack on America, we've been hearing some jargon about the Islam religion and how humane it is. Though certain sects of Islam may be more humane than others, it is not to say that love and forgiving are consistent among all Islam sects. As with all religions of the world, the balances between love and hate are in the hands of who's interpreting it. Islam takes its origin back to the Prophet Mohammed. He was born in Mecca, Arabia around 541 A.D. Mohammed was orphaned at an early age and was raised by a succession of relatives. Eventually, a rich merchant uncle took over and sent him on trading excursions where he met Old and New Testament people. At age 25, he was proposed to by a wealthy widow of 40 named Khadja. She bore him three daughters but no sons. By the time Mohammed was 40, he had developed mystical traits. According to hear-say, he received a revelation compelling him to denounce paganism and polytheism in Mecca and to preach the existence of only one god (Allah). He called his few early followers companions. The Koran (Quran) was born from his revelation. It listed Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Mohammed as prophets. Though the Koran forbids its true believers from committing aggression, it also calls on its believers to fight in the way of God against all those who fight against him. It also recommends that those who ascribe partners to God (Allah), thereby denying the unity of God, should be destroyed. This is known to all fundamentalist Muslims as Jihad (holy war), thus leaving these devout Muslims in a perpetual constant war against all religions which do not follow the Koran. The five pillars of Islam are as follows: 1. There is no God but God, and Mohammed is the prophet of God. 2. Muslims pray five times daily - at daybreak, noon, mid-afternoon, after sunset, and early in the night. 3. During the month of fasting (Ramadan), Muslims must not eat, drink, or have sexual relations between dawn and sunset. 4. All Muslims must give alms (zakat) amounting to no less than two-and-a-half percent of their income and certain kinds of property to charity. 5. A true Muslim must make at least one pilgrimage to Mecca during his lifetime. Mohammed made his birthplace Mecca the capital of all Islam before his death in 632 AD when he was in his nineties. Mohammed named no successors. He was succeeded by two caliphs. Abu Bakr and Umar. They were his companions. The birth of the Arab race came from the see of Ishmael who was sired by Abraham through Hagar, a slave belonging to Abraham whose wife Sarah was barren. After Sarah gave birth to Isaac, however, she forced Abraham to banish Hagar and Ishmael so her son Isaac wouldn't lose his firstborn privileges. As the Old Testament tells us, the Jewish race was sired through the seed of Isaac, making the Jews and Arabs half brothers. No doubt, most of the background of traditional religions comes from hearsay or unwitnessed doctrines. And although our historians do the best they can to verify some of the details, there can be no doubt that there are some biased exaggerations. As for Islam being without prejudice or hate, I would say that it is no more or less than other religions. Verifiable history confirms this fact over and over again. One such confirmation which history didn't have to confirm to me was what I saw firsthand during WW II. During the war, our infantry unit had to handle a lot of German POW's. On many of these POW's were their infamous Nazi bell buckles on which was embossed in raised letters Gott Mit Uns (God's with us). In this regard, I'm sure you'd have a hell of time proving that to the 6,00,000 Jews who were mercilessly exterminated by Hitler and his devout Christian followers. And how about those benevolent Moslem Ottoman Turks and other subject people who slaughtered 1,500.000 of our Armenian men, women, and children between 1915-1923? Then, of course, there's King Leopold and the Belgium Congo, Biafra, Japan and the rape of Nanking, the Crusades, the American Indians, slavery, Stalin, the Inquisition, etc. I could go on and on but when we look at the bottom line of any religion, no matter how kind and forgiving its credo, we find it to be in the hands of the interpreter. As history points out, during times of conflict and upheaval, religion becomes only a tool in the hands of the propagandist. Today, we find ourselves at war with terrorism. It's a war that was inevitable. But more than that, regardless of what the underlying circumstances are, it's a war that we have to win, and win we will. Be that as it may, with all of its kinks and flaws, this is the world we live in. And its problems are the outgrowths of the shortcomings of our past. Those who established these shortcomings have long since passed on into eternity, but we are still here following without question. In short, the ball is in our court. We can go on following our separate beaten paths into extinction or we can, at long last, try to find some common ground. But before we do that, we have a war to win.","Vosbikian, Joseph",Armenian Reporter International,2001-11-10,1
"AS GEORGIA'S TROUBLES MOUNT, WILL ARMENIANS LEARN THEIR LESSON? Armenia's northern neighbor, Georgia, is blessed with a good climate, natural beauty, and fertile land. Its geographical location - between the Caucasus mountain range on the north, Turkey on the southwest, Black Sea on the west, and Azerbaijan on the east - is considered to be a strategic asset. Indeed, Georgia has become the focus of attention for the regional and global powers. Zviad Gamsakhurdia was democratically elected president of the newly independent Georgia to the populist nationalistic cries of Georgia only for Georgians. He alienated other ethnic groups, which made up forty percent of the population. He didn't tolerate any opposition, tried to intimidate his political opponents and became autocratic and oppressive. Gamsakhurdia tried to establish a cozy relationship with the Turks and Chechen terrorists and naively relied on Western assistance to challenge Moscow, thereby totally alienating Russia. When he faced political troubles, the West didn't come to his rescue, since his image was tarnished by his dictatorial and narrow-minded nationalistic and anti-ethnic policy. In the end he was overthrown by a violent revolution and took refuge in Chechnya, only to be subsequently murdered by unknown assailants. SHEVARDNADZE COMES HOME Following the Zviadists' departure from the political scene, the Georgian clans and former Communist nomenklatura brought ex-KGB chief, former Soviet Politburo member and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze from Moscow to Tbilisi, where he assumed the presidency of Georgia. During the first years of his presidency he was able to make concessions to Russia and joined the CIS. He was partially successful in establishing law and order and domestic tranquility in this fragmented land, full of a myriad of problems ranging from corruption, ethnic separatism, economic decline, energy shortages to thousand-digit inflation. Shevardnadze's support base consisted largely of political moderates, and he initially achieved a limited peace with Georgia's ethnic minorities. Yet being an ex-KGB chief, he relied mostly on the police and internal security forces to quarrel with domestic woes, rather than undertake serious reforms to improve the socio-economic conditions in this impoverished nation. He failed to take serious measures to stamp out corruption, he didn't take any punitive actions against criminal gangs and clan leaders protected by private armies, and continued to alienate democratic forces. In order to distract the discontented populace from socio-economic hardship, declining production and a thousand-fold increase in inflation, he placed too much emphasis on foreign policy matters. With a direct challenge to Russia's economic and national interests, he promoted the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline project, hoping that being a transit country, Georgia would receive fortunes and build up its impoverished economy. Thus Georgia's role in the region became pivotal. Courted by Turkey and the U.S., and bribed by Azerbaijan and the oil companies, Georgia's leader Eduard Shevardnadze grew overconfident and often reckless. He totally ignored the national interests of the other regional power, Russia, cultivated a military and political alliance with Turkey, and became an active member of the GUAM, an anti-Moscow alliance, formed by Georgia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova. President Shevardnadze with all his foreign policy experience and skills, miserably failed to convince ethnic Ossetians, Abkhazians, and Adjarians to remain within Georgia. Encouraged by Moscow, these rebel region's separatist leaders refused subordination to Tbilisi and asserted their independence. DEEP POLITICAL CRISIS Poverty, crimes, unemployment, socioeconomic decline, political instability, and interethnic hostilities have plunged Georgia into a deep political crisis. On Oct. 30, officers of the State Security Ministry raided the offices of the Rustavi-2 television station, ostensibly to inspect the company's books. But the action, in fact, was part of an effort to intimidate and silence the independent media for criticizing the government for corruption and ineptness. The raid prompted demonstrations in front of the parliament building and demands that the security minister, interior minister and prosecutor general resign or be fired. Facing resignations from his cabinet members and indignation from the populace, President Shevardnadze realized that the demonstrators were also asking for his resignation so he was forced to dismiss the entire cabinet. Georgia's political turmoil will certainly have repercussions beyond that country's borders. Georgia is considered to be crucial for regional energy security. Natural gas from Russia to Armenia, and transportation of vital commodities from abroad to Armenia crosses Georgian territory. The proposed Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline will also cross Georgian territory. In Georgia, the national interests of Russia and Turkey collide; proxy wars in Chechnya and Abkhazia, tensions in the conflict zone of Nagorno Karabagh, and separatist movements in Adjaria and south Ossetia are also being fanned, mainly by Russians and Turks. If Georgia collapses, the potential victors will look for the spoils of the vanquished. At this point, in order to prevent further disasters in the Caucasus, it would be prudent to convene a conference with the participation of Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and their great neighbor Russia, in order to deflate the tension and to look for local solutions to the problems without the inclusion of outside forces, since rivalry among outside forces may destabilize and inflame the situation further. Reactivation of the previously proposed Caucasus Stability Pact would serve everyone's interests, with the exclusion of any regional players from regional energy sharing leading to more confrontation. CALM POSSIBLE The crisis in Georgia, the aftermath of the terrorist campaign and efforts to build a larger anti-terrorist coalition by the Bush administration may calm down, without creating conflicts among outside forces. Currently, threatened by Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, both Russia and the U.S. are cooperating and working together. In fact, While House officials confirmed that President Bush's national security adviser, Condoleeza Rice, has made a series of calls around Capitol Hill and was asked to revoke the main economic sanction against Russia remaining from the Cold War era, known as the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Obviously the U.S. needs Russia's cooperation to conduct an anti-terrorist campaign in Afghanistan, and Russia also needs the cooperation of the U.S. to fight against Chechen terrorists in Chechnya and also to halt Islamic fundamentalist terrorism close to its southern soft belly, populated by Muslim-Turkic groups. Even an accord on the deployment of antiballistic missile defense and further reduction of nuclear warheads is anticipated, and it looks like a common threat, forcing Washington and Moscow to cooperate. It is ironic that, during Jimmy Carter's presidency, his National Security adviser Zbigniew Brezezinski was making every effort to arm and strengthen the Afghan Mujaheddins against Soviet occupiers. The same Mujaheddins, after defeating the Russians, with the help of Pakistani dictators, later evolved into the Taliban movement, and now have become a hostile and menacing force against the very power that once helped them. Faced with the same threats, both Russia and the U.S. may restrain from fanning the flames in crisis-stricken Georgia, and may leash warmongers in Baku and their sponsors in Ankara, forcing the Azeris and Georgians to face certain realities on the ground and look for peaceful settlements of the conflicts in Abkhazia and Karabagh. Hopefully, Armenian politicians in Yerevan will soon learn their lessons from the Georgian experience, instead of trying to collect votes to impeach the incumbent president, who will-overturn that shameful parliament vote which secured the seat of the fugitive and criminal Vano Siradeghian. It is embarrassing that the Chairmen of the ANM (HHSh) Party Alexander Arzumanyan didn't have any objection, when he included fugitive and criminal Vano Siradeghian's signature among those asking for President Robert Kocharian's impeachment. The circumstance that created the crisis in Georgia is not unique to that Caucasian state alone. Similar socioeconomic and political instability also is present in both Armenia and Azerbaijan. It is about time that politicians in Armenia uphold the nation's interests above their blind personal ambitions and greed and serve their country and their people to make Armenia a stable, secure, prosperous democratic country.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-11-10,1
"Ireland's View of WTC Disaster: It Affects Us All It's as if Ireland was yet another suburb of New York, such was the feeling of affinity between the people of this country and the citizens of the stricken city, after news came through of the terrible deeds which took place in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania on Tuesday. We knew immediately that many Irish names would be included among the dead and injured and sure enough we were soon hearing of victims from Cork and Dublin and reports that people from counties Sligo, Galway, Tipperary, Tyrone and Donegal were among those listed as missing. Of course Irish names were also included among those who were fortunate enough to flee the World Trade Center buildings before they came crashing to the ground. The links between the two countries were most evident in the conversations taking place as people met for the first time after the newsbroke. Everyone seemed to know or be related to someone who worked in the New York financial district; had visited the World Trade Center in recent days; was planning to visit the twin towers on the fateful day; escaped from a building before it collapsed; was related to or knew one of the victims; or witnessed the planes crashing into towers. The Government seemed to have accurately assessed the reaction of the general public by declaring Friday to be a National Day of Mourning with the same status as a Bank Holiday. That decision was made on Wednesday after the Taoiseach and almost the entire Cabinet called at the US Embassy to offer sympathy to Ambassador Richard Egan and sign a book of condolences. Earlier in the day President Mary McAleese and her husband Martin had paid their respects at the Embassy. The National Day of Morning turned out to be just that. Schools, stores, factories, offices, Government departments, banks, filling stations, bars and restaurants, for the most part remained closed throughout the day. Crowds attended church services across the country and queued to sign books of condolence. In the morning President McAleese addressed the nation via the radio, setting the tone for the day. She later attended the ecumenical service at the Pro-Cathedral in Dublin, along with the Taoiseach, the Tanaiste, other leading politicians, members of the diplomatic corps and the general public. The service was led by Cardinal Desmond Connell, Church of Ireland Archbishop Walton Empey and the leaders of seven other Christian denominations. Elsewhere the Jewish and Muslim communities held their own separate remembrance services. Many people who wished to attend had to remain outside. The story was repeated in other parts of the country. In the afternoon crowds arrived at the US Embassy in Ballsbridge to sign the book of condolence. At one stage gardai estimated that there were 6,000 people queuing outside the embassy and the waiting time exceeded two hours. Some 17,000 people had signed the book prior to Friday and almost twice that number signed on Friday. Galway Cathedral was packed for a commemorative Mass at noon. It was already standing room only when we arrived at 11:45am and when Mass started aisles were thronged and a large crowd was assembled outside. One estimate put the total number at 5,000. Among the congregation were United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson and her husband Nick, Mayor Donal Lyons, city councillors, members of the fire service, and a contingent of Army officers. The first confirmed Irish victims of the terrorists were Ruth McCourt (nee Clifford) and her four-year-old daughter, Juliana, who were passengers on the United Airlines jet which crashed into the World Trade Center. Ruth (45) was a native of Ballintemple in Cork who spent most of her adult life in the US, settling in Connecticut. She had planned to take a few days holiday in Los Angeles with a friend but couldn't get seats on the same flight. Her friend perished in the American Airlines flight. Ruth is survived by her husband David and three brothers, one in the US and two in Ireland. It wasn't until Thursday morning that we heard of another Irish person who had been in one of the hijacked aircraft. Patrick Currivan (53), originally from Drimnagh in Dublin, was on the American Airlines flight from Boston to LA which crashed into the other tower. He had been travelling from France, where he held a senior position in the Paris stock exchange, and was on his way to LA for a meeting. Having once lived in Boston he decided to stop over to visit some friends rather than fly direct. Patrick, a former president of the TCD Alumni Association in Boston, is survived by a sister and brother who live in Rush, Co. Dublin. - Fr Michael Judge (68), chaplain to the New York Fire Service, was one of the victims. The Franciscan priest was giving a fire officer the last rites when he was crushed by the falling building. Fr Mike, whose parents were from Co. Leitrim, was a regular visitor to this country. - Kieran Gorman (35), from Lavagh, Co. Sligo, was a construction worker on a contract on the 98th floor of the south tower. As he tried to escape from the building he managed to phone his wife Ann but he has not been heard from since. Mr. Gorman once played in goal for the Sligo Gaelic football team. - Martin Coughlan (53), a native of Cappawhite, Co. Tipperary, a carpenter who was working in the building, had been near the top of the south tower when it was struck. He phoned his wife Catherine (nee Tierney), who is from Galway city, to say that he was making his way down the stairs and had reached an area of thick smoke on the 84th floor. That was the last that was heard from him. The couple have four daughters aged 17 to 27. - Ann Marie McHugh (35), from Tuam, Co. Galway, worked on the 89th floor of the south tower and was last seen by colleagues on the 40th floor as the building was being evacuated. Until recently her parents Padraic and Margaret owned the Town Hall Tavern in Tuam. Ann Marie, who was in the WTC at the time of the 1993 bomb, was planning to marry in November. - Several families from the North were awaiting news of relatives and friends who are feared dead in the atrocity. Speaking from her north Belfast home, Sheila Quinn (79) said her brother's grandson, Brian Monaghan (21) had been working as a joiner on the 102nd floor of the south tower of the World Trade Center when the first plane struck. Mrs. Quinn explained, He phoned his mother Jeannie and told her about the first crash which they thought was an accident. Then he said, 'You want to see the flames. They're like big balls of fire. I have to go', and the phone went dead. They have not heard from him since. - Similarly the Canavan family in Ballygawley, Co. Tyrone fear the worst as their cousin, Sean Canavan (32), has not been heard from since the first plane crashed into the WTC. Sean, a first cousin of Tyrone Gaelic footballers Peter and Paschal, was working on the 98th floor and called his sister to say he was fine. Minutes later the second plane struck the building he was in and he also has not been heard from since. - Two cousins of Fine Gael TD Gerry Reynolds are also missing. The brothers, aged 36 and 38, were American born and working as stockbrokers on the 105th floor. The Sligo-Leitrim TD was on 34th Street when the first tower collapsed. - Donegal men Bill Deane (35), who worked for an insurance company on the 100th floor of one of the towers, and Damien Meehan who was on the 92nd, have not been heard from since the planes crashed into the buildings. Damien's father Mike, is very well known in New York's Donegal community. There is also concern in the home of the McSheffrey family in the townland of Ballyharry, near Culdaff, where a grandson is one of the missing firemen. - Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he believed that at least two of his friends in New York were missing following the catastrophe. One was a priest and the other a man who had organised an event on the top floor of the World Trade Centre to raise money for Sinn Fein. - I'm told by friends, said Mr. Adams, that there is little hope of finding him alive. Others we met that day are almost certainly on the casualty list. Another New York friend, an ex-fireman, is coming to terms with the fact that all of his friends have been wiped out. - Many Irish Americans are expected to be among the 700 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who are unaccounted for. All were based in the top floors of the north tower. - Two leading Irish American businessmen with financial services company Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, are also missing. Joseph Berry was the company's chairman and co-chief executive while Joseph Lenihan was vice-chairman. Around 70 of their colleagues are also missing. - The Irish Times reports that four Irish tourists were thought to have been on the observation deck of one of the towers when the tragedy occurred but there has been no confirmation of this. - It is expected that the number of Irish nationals to die in the disaster will be between 20 and 30, with the number of Irish American fatalities far in excess of that. - The Department of Foreign Affairs said it would be sending extra staff to its US consulates to help track down Irish nationals who may have been in the vicinity of the attacks. - Ireland, in common with other countries across Europe, observed three minutes' silence at 11:00am Irish time on Friday. - On Friday afternoon a pipe band led some 250 firemen, from North and South, as they paraded to the US Embassy where they laid a wreath among the hundreds of other floral tributes which had been left there in the preceding days. - The Dublin City Centre Business Association set up an assistance and solidarity centre to assist visiting Americans who required counselling, access to email or to telephones. A steady stream of people used the services, which were located in the St. Stephen's Green Shopping Centre. - Both the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and the SDLP leader John Hume paid their respects to the families of the dead and missing at a special recall of the British Parliament. The Northern Assembly was also convened and unanimously passed a motion of sympathy to the American people in their worst hour. A book of sympathy was then opened in Stormont. Acting Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon condemned those who carried out the atrocity, This wasn't just an attack on America but an indiscriminate attack on a centre of world commerce staffed and used by people of all nationalities he said. - The Irish Times didn't appear on Friday as management decided that it too should heed the Government's call for a day of mourning. - Bishop of Down and Connor Dr. Patrick Walsh celebrated Mass for the victims in St. Peter's Catholic Cathedral in Belfast on Sunday. Among the congregation was Tom Constantine, the former New York State Police Chief who is now the Oversight Commissioner for the implementation of policing reform. He fears that he has lost three close friends in the disaster. Elsewhere in the North yesterday an interdenominational service was held in St. Columb's Cathedral, Derry, and an Inter-church service, attended by the Northern Secretary, was held on Saturday in St. Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral Belfast. THE FALLOUT - Many planes which were on their way to North America from different parts of Europe were diverted to Shannon on Tuesday. This caused an accommodation problem and some local families volunteered to look after passengers who might otherwise have been left to sleep in the airport. - Passengers from Ireland had a similar experience, with at least one Delta flight and one Continental flight being diverted to Newfoundland. Interviewed on RTE radio, one Co. Wicklow man who should have been in the Florida sun said that they were being looked after so well by locals that, no one will want to leave. - Some Delta flights left Ireland on Friday but it was Saturday before Aer Lingus started to clear the backlog. This is proving a difficult task and many were disappointed when they were told that there were no seats for them. The airline is giving priority to people whose relatives are dead or missing. Those who have booked Aer Lingus flights from today are expected to report to the airport and only those changing travel arrangements or whose flights were cancelled in the past week should phone the airline. The latter group are being offered seats as they become available.","Ferrie, Liam",The Boston Irish Reporter,2001-10-31,1
"Faces and Places: Immigration; benefit or bane? The September 11 attack on the United States by Muslim terrorists has reopened the seemingly endless debate regarding immigration. Are new immigrants to America a benefit or a bane? That is the question. One of the most outspoken critics of mass immigration has been conservative Samuel Francis who, as early as 1982, argued that our poor border control represents an opportunity for foreign terrorists, for domestic extremists and for hostile foreign powers to destabilize this country. Others feel the same way, including, more recently, Linda Chavez who suggests restoring the requisite that all aliens register with the government once a year (a requirement abolished in 1980), and creating a state-of-the-art tracking system that monitors alien entries and exits from the United States. Over the years, U.S. immigration law has tended to vacillate between two beliefs: America is a haven for the huddled masses of the world; America is the last bastion of white, Western civilization. Immigration to the United States was wide open until about 1914. The industrial revolution and westward expansion after the Civil War demanded cheap immigrant labor; practically everyone from Europe was welcome. Beginning in the 1870s, most of the new immigrants were from the impoverished rural regions of southern and eastern Europe. Barely literate, they settled in ethnic enclaves in large cities and mining states that offered employment. They came in great numbers. At the turn of the century, for example, most residents of Chicago were foreign-born. In 1909 progressive educator Elwood Cubberley concluded that because the new immigrants were docile, lacking in self-reliance and initiative, bereft of the Anglo-Teutonic conceptions of law, government and order, their coming served to dilute tremendously our national stock and to corrupt our civic life. The first world war temporarily halted mass immigration to America. In need of an expanded officer class, the U.S. military introduced literacy exams for all recruits during the war. Young immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, of course, scored poorly, confirming Dr. Cubberley's views. Not all of America's pre-war immigrants were illiterate, however. Some could read and had become enamored of socialism. The first nationwide Ukrainian political party in the United States, for example, was the Ukrainian Federation of Socialist Parties of America (UFSPA), established in 1915 with encouragement from the Socialist Party of America (SPA). By 1918 the UFSPA included some 4,000 members. A group of SPA members later quit the SPA to create the Communist Party of America (CPA) that same year. Most UFSPA members joined the defectors and formed the Ukrainian Federation of Communist Parties of America (UFCPA) in 1919. Founded in Chicago, the CPA had 26,680 members, of which only 1,100 were native Americans. The revolutionary fervor of American Communists and other extremists shocked the American public. The nation was plagued by a wave of bombings (eight cities were hit), strikes (some 4 million workers were out at one time or another), riots and other disturbances. Alarmed by a war department estimate of some 1,142,000 leftwing extremists in the United States, as well as the discovery of a Moscow-initiated directive to American Communist leaders to form a military commission and to carry out Comintern instructions in the greatest secrecy, the Justice Department moved quickly against aliens who advocated the forceful overthrow of the American government. On the authority of Attorney General Mitchell Palmer, FBI agents rounded up thousands of Americans. The so-called Palmer Raids led to great uncertainty, even hysteria among the public. Contributing to the anti-immigrant atmosphere were writers who echoed Dr. Cubberley's earlier sentiments. A 1922 article by Cornelia James Cannon in The Atlantic Monthly, for example, analyzed the Army test results and concluded that the inferior men included a disproportionate number from Poland, Italy and Russia. That same year The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of Under Man by Lothrop Stoddard made its appearance, suggesting that America's racial stock was being weakened by immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. Other books denouncing the wretched refuse followed. Responding to popular opinion, Congress passed laws in 1921 and 1924 calculating future immigration quotas on the basis of the nationalities living here during the 1890 Census. Since Ukrainians were not an official designation in 1890, there were no official quotas for Ukrainians. Another anti-immigrant alarm surfaced during World War II when Americans of Japanese, German and Italian descent were singled out as possible threats. In 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which forcibly removed Japanese Americans living in the states of Washington, Oregon and California from their homes and placed them in internment camps. The order was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court. In 1948 the United States returned to its huddled masses mode when Congress passed and President Harry Truman signed the Displaced Persons Act, allowing refugees from communism to emigrate freely. Today, it seems the U.S. Congress is striving to make our nation more multicultural. According to an article by Joseph A. Agostino in the October 1 issue of Human Events, Sen. Teddy Kennedy (D-Mass.) introduced the so-called Diversity Immigrant Visa Program in 1990 for just that purpose. Signed into law by President George Bush, the goal of the program is to issue highly prized permanent residence visas to 50,000 foreign nationals from countries that send relatively few immigrants to the United States. Administered by the State Department under Section 203(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, the program went into effect in 1995. Despite the fears of nativists over the years, immigration has always been and remains a benefit to the United States. In his new book The New Americans: How the Melting Pot Can Work Again, political analyst Michael Barone writes that like past immigrants, our new immigrants will be interwoven into the fabric of American life...It can happen even more rapidly if all of us realize that that interweaving is part of the basic character of the country. That means a melting pot predicated on cultural pluralism rather than multiculturalism. Myron Kuropas' e-mail address is: mbkuropas@compuserve.com.","Kuropas, Myron B",Ukrainian Weekly,2001-10-28,1
"Armenia 2001 - Part III of III: Views from Yerevan; Controversial TARC Is a Misnomer When the formation of the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission was announced for the first time in July of this year, with great fanfare, most Armenians became aware of its existence from the pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. Because of the attendant secrecy, and involvement of only a handful of individuals, many people were taken by surprise. At first glance, some Armenian readers got the impression that something important must have happened that these two influential newspapers were printing this announcement, since both newspapers are known for their pro-Turkish bias and usually choose to ignore Armenian-related topics. After the initial bewilderment, activist Armenians realized that TARC was the product of lengthy and secret meetings, which had the active support of the U.S. State Department, Turkish Foreign Ministry and Diplomatic Academy of Vienna. The Armenia government was also aware but was not actively involved. HARD-LINE GENOCIDE DENIERS The Turkish participants are hard-line Armenian Genocide deniers, known for their association with the Turkish Military and Foreign Ministry establishments, and hand-picked by the Turkish government. One would anticipate that the counterparts of these high-ranking and seasoned Turkish diplomats and military intelligence representatives will be Armenian government representatives and Armenian diplomats so as to be on a par with their reconciliation partners, yet the Armenian participants turned out to be an array of unlikely individuals identified and assigned to the commission by the US State Department, which created skepticism and controversy. The Terms of Reference, agreed upon by the TARC members after emphasizing the serious differences between Armenian and Turkish participants, completely failed to address the main issue, the Armenian Genocide, and legal problems related with it. After all, the Armenian Genocide was a political act, premeditated, organized and executed by the Ottoman government to create a homogenous Pan-Turkish state comprised of Muslim Turks and free of foreign -, that is, Armenian - elements, and was not the result of interethnic or religious hatred, inter-communal conflict or civil war, as the Turks prefer to portray it. NEED TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES Therefore, common sense requires that any Turkish Armenian reconciliation process should address the fundamental outstanding unresolved issues separating Turks and Armenians and work for a political solution; namely, to deal with issues involving confiscated lands and properties as well as bank accounts, life insurance and holdings. Without inclusion of reparations, restitution or financial and territorial compensation, one cannot talk about genuine reconciliation. Yet the commission came up with cosmetic recommendations only and so-called confidence-building measures envisioned as joint projects to be carried out in the fields of business, tourism, culture, education, environment, and media, which have already been implemented gradually over the past ten years, long before the creation of TARC. Aside from failing to address the fundamental outstanding unresolved issues separating Turks and Armenians related to the Armenian Genocide, the very composition of the Turkish members of the unofficial commission, and their arguments or statements created the impression that Turkey's Foreign Policy and Military establishment circles and the U.S. State Department had more than historical reconciliation on their minds when they jointly cosponsored TARC. Their objective appears to be skirting of the Armenian Genocide issue, which is perceived to be potentially damaging to Turkey's international standing and its relation with Western European and NATO partner countries. GEOPOLITICAL REASONS FOR TARC Following the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by French, Italian, Belgian, Swedish, Russian, and European Parliaments, and the Papal Office, Turks overreacted with anger, reprisals and threats. As the U.S. Intelligence Services helped to deliver Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan to Turkish National Security Agents, in order to prevent the further destabilization of Turkey, most people suspect that the U.S. State Department acted with similar reasoning when it spearheaded the formation of TARC. Also many suspect that there are geopolitical considerations behind the attempts at Turkish Armenian reconciliation, to neutralize the Russian and Iranian influence in the region, in order to open the energy-rich Caspian Basin and Central Asia to U.S. penetration. Since the recent terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, the region of Central Asia has become more than ever a crucial place; in fact, the U.S. obtained rights to use Uzbekistan airfields as a staging area to conduct antiterrorist operations in Afghanistan. Along with the complex political realignment in the region, TARC is also considered to be a political tool rather than a forum to solve unresolved Turkish-Armenian disputes created by the Armenian Genocide. And the commission so far is reluctant to involve itself with legal, financial, normal and property issues that need to be resolved if true reconciliation is intended or targeted. Alas, after reading the statements that the Turkish members of the commission made after the announcement of TARC, one cannot help but become more skeptical about the intent of the Turkish government dominated by generals. In fact, the presence of retired Air Force General Sadi Etrguvenc is most revealing. He is the Commander of Joint Security and Chief of the Turkish Intelligent Headquarters. He is the most powerful member of the Committee; his expertise includes analyzing data about the strengths and weaknesses of the adversary, to gather information about the intent, activities, plans and agendas of the enemy, to assess their power base and resources, the degree of public support they are receiving, etc. His objectives are to devise methods as to how to circumvent the Genocide-related legal, moral, and material compensation issues and replace them with cosmetic Terms of References, as one can see in TARC's press release. UNEQUAL PARTNERSHIP After reviewing the statements by the other Turkish members of the commission, one gets the impression that the Armenian participants, in fact, were not treated as equal partners in this commission, since they were totally victimized, deceived and placed in compromising situations with the following statements attributed to Turkish members of the commission. Gunduz Aktan, former Turkish Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, is known for his testimony before the Congressional Hearing of the Armenian Genocide in September of 2000, in which he vehemently denied the Armenian Genocide and issued threats against the Congress that recognition of the alleged Genocide may have dire consequences for Turkish-American relations. Later, after the formation of TARC, he called it a matter of concern for jurists and historians. In his recent writing in the Turkish Daily News, he gloated that the British Ambassador to Armenia Timothy Jones labeled the events of the 1915-23 era as terrible historical events without using the word Genocide, and called this Armenian defeat. Ozdem Sanberg, former Deputy Foreign Minister of the Republic of Turkey and currently Executive Director of Istanbul-based think tanks, made it abundantly clear that The basic goal of our commission is to impede the initiatives put forth every year in the US Congress and Parliaments of Western countries for the Genocide issue and aimed at weakening Turkey. Later he elaborated further and stated: The significant matter for us is that the Genocide issue is not discussed by the American Congress any more. Because, as long as we continue the dialogue, the issue won't be brought back to the Congress's agenda, loud and clear. Another Turkish member of the commission, Volkan Vanik, psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, has worked closely with noted Armenian Genocide denier Norman Itzkowitz, and qualifies the Armenian obsession with the Genocide issue as a national psychosis or persecution syndrome, rather than a legitimate human psychological response to Turkish denial. The rest of the Turkish commission members - Ustun Erguder, the former President of the Bogazici University, and Ilter Turkmen, former Foreign Minister of the Republic of Turkey - are all closely linked to the Turkish military establishment that has been at the forefront of Turkey's denial of the Armenian Genocide and anti-Armenian propaganda and misinformation campaign. TURKISH OBJECTIVES After this comprehensive review, one reaches the conclusion that Turkish agenda and strategy target certain objectives with the following unambiguous statements attributed to a Turkish member of the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission: 1) None of the Turkish participants in TARC considered the events of 1915-16 as Genocide. 2) The intention is reducing the effects of the events in history and present day (their intent is to make the Armenian Genocide issue irrelevant, in both political and legal terms.) 3) The matter is principally the concern of jurists and historians (here again, marginalizing, de-politicizing or reducing the magnitude of the crime to the more controversial historical and disputable events.) 4) The intent is not to find what the truth is, but to open new horizons for the future and enhance mutual understanding. (Although they all know the truth, they choose not to face the reality, based on selective amnesia, and they are trying to force the Armenian side to do the same, to reconcile with denial; therefore, the use of terminology of reconciliation with denial would be more appropriate than misusing the word of TARC.) 5) The Armenian Diaspora and Government of Armenia has prompted to influence the foreign parliaments, foreign news media and education systems against us; it is better to engage them to dialogue rather than risking international condemnation and witnessing passage of the Armenian Genocide resolutions by various foreign parliaments. 6) The basic goal of Turkish commission members is to impede the initiatives put forth every year in the US Congress and Parliaments of Western countries for the Genocide issue and aimed weakening Turkey. The Armenian members of the commission have yet to define clearly their objectives other than those stated in the cosmetic Terms of References released jointly with their Turkish counterparts. None of the stated terms directly or indirectly touches on fundamental issues arising from the forced deportations of the Armenian civilian population from their native lands, followed by wholesale organized massacres, confiscation of lands, properties, bank accounts, holdings, insurance policies, and destruction of the Armenian churches, schools and monuments. WHAT CRITICS OF TARC ARE OPPOSED TO Critics of the Commission don't oppose the principles of free dialogue between Turks and Armenians as a method of dissolving outstanding issues but they raise objections against the intent of the Turkish government and the US State Department to circumvent the Genocide issue for political expediency and geo-political gains, and to force the Armenian side not to bring legal and political implications of the Genocide to appropriate forums, and sidetrack Armenian national interests and cause. The intent is to promote Turkish interests under the pretext of maintaining regional stability, bringing Armenia into partnership with Turkey, looking to the future and forgetting the past, one which places a heavy burden on both nations. In conclusion, as long as the Armenian Studies and Research Center, recently established in Ankara, continues to conduct revisionism, distortions and anti-Armenian propaganda and blame the victims for their misfortune in order to vindicate the perpetrators; as long as the Armenian presence and history is denied in the Turkish textbooks, as long as the Turkish members use TARC to circumvent the Armenian Genocide and disclaim an moral, legal, and/or financial responsibility for the Armenian Genocide victims, then what we talking about is not true reconciliation, but reconciliation with denial. Cosmetic gestures by the Turkish side, like the recent Turkish translation and publication of the anthology of Armenian literature, releasing CDs of Armenian songs, or allowing Armenian tourists to visit Akhtamar or the Ani Cathedral, are no substitutes for the assumption of moral, legal and financial responsibilities for the perpetrated Genocide crime.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-10-20,1
"Armenia 2001, Terrorists and Opportunists - Part II of III The U.S. drive for a coalition against terrorism has brought many nations and world leaders together, each motivated by their own reasoning and needs. Some were genuinely outraged and, based on principles, closed ranks with the U.S.; some, which have problems with homegrown terrorist organizations, wanted to take part in the fight against international terrorism to justify their own struggles against separatism and ethnic insurrection; some wanted to gain brownie points with the Bush administration to cover their suppression of their own populace and human rights violations. According to Armenian intellectuals in Yerevan, two nations, Armenia and Israel, might have the most to lose. Already the Turks and the Azeris are trying to take advantage of the situation, opening their air space and facilities to the U.S. and reminding Washington that, at the time of need, they are on the side of the Americans. Therefore they anticipate return favors, conveniently forgetting their past conduct of state-sponsored terrorism against Armenians, Kurds, Greeks and other minority groups. By the same token, Israel is outraged that they are marginalized and frozen out of the coalition and that certain pressure was applied on Tel Aviv to return to Israeli-Palestinian negotiations and compromises in order to keep the anti-Taliban Arab coalition together. During these turbulent times when terrorism is threatening the whole civilization, diehard Russian forces in the West are against cooperating with Moscow out of fear that the Russians may take advantage and wipe out Chechen resistance on the pretext of fighting against terrorism. Even, Armenia's neighbor, Azerbaijan, is coming out with the most outrageous reasoning that the U.S. and West may now tolerate it if the Azeri armed forces, with Ankara's assistance, conduct an art-terrorist campaign against the terrorist Karabagh Armenians and solve the Karabagh issue once and for all. In many regions of the world, there are ethnic and religious conflicts, hunger and starvation, instances of man's inhumanity toward man, wars resulting from simmering border disputes, which are the consequence of arbitrary boundaries created by colonial and imperial forces, and acts of terrorism to change the existing orders, not to mention the human rights violations committed by many homegrown dictators, as well as their suppression of their own peoples. Now the civilized world is facing another dilemma, unprecedented in the history of mankind; terrorists are striking civilian population centers and public buildings in New York, Washington and Moscow and are blackmailing the greater powers into giving in to their political demands. WHAT'S ON MINDS OF ORDINARY PEOPLE The ordinary people in the streets of Yerevan and Tel Aviv, who are either direct or indirect victims of state-sponsored terrorism during the Genocide of 1915-23 and Holocaust of 1940-45, are wondering when the time will come for mankind to learn its lesson, that once dictatorial regimes in the past or present get away with murder, new mass murderers may convince themselves that they can get away with it as well. Osama bin Laden is the product of the ill-conceived opportunistic foreign policy objectives pursued by certain regional leaders and co-sponsored by foreign powers. According to the veterans of the Soviet war against Afghanistan living in Armenia, it is no secret that, for the past fourteen years and with the tacit approval of subsequent US administrations, Pakistani dictators created the radical Afghan Mujaheddin movement as a bulwark of opposition against the ill-fated Soviet intervention in this region. According to those same veterans, the Soviets wanted to stop the Islamic fundamentalist movement in their southern soft belly where Turkic-Islamic population from Kazakhstan to Kyrgyzstan, from Turkmenistan to Uzbekistan, remained vulnerable to Islamic resurgence. After the collapse of the USSR, the pro-Russian regime was toppled in Kabul and, later, the Taliban movement sponsored by the Pakistani Intelligence Services took power from the moderate Islamic rulers. With their extremist Islamic leanings, the Taliban managed to export revolution and, under Osama bin Laden's Qaeda Jihad organization, terrorists were trained and established cells in the Central Asian Turkic republics, Chechnya, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Sudan, Mauritania, Algeria, Yemen, Somalia, Kenya, India, China's Turkic Sinkiang-Uighur Province, Malaysia and the Philippines. Azeri cooperation and relations between the Turkish Grey Wolves and Osama bin Laden is also well known. It is no secret that Aliyev hired Afghan Mujaheddins to fight against the Karabagh Armenians, and the Chechen war against infidel Russians was sponsored and financed by the Saudis and Turks. SERIOUS QUESTIONS POSED Armenia's intellectuals are posing the following questions: Why did the U.S. give this military aid, including sophisticate shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles, to the Afghanis, aid which they may now skillfully use against U.S. targets? Why, in order to please the Turks, did Washington intentionally not overthrow Saddam Hussein during Desert Storm when the US forces were just a striking distance from Baghdad? Was it out of fear that Saddam's departure might create a power vacuum and lead to the creation of an independent Kurdistan which could inflame nationalistic sentiments among Turkey's 15 million Kurds and undermine the stability of Turkey as well? Why did the U.S.-sponsored Bosnian Muslim state in the center of Europe undermine the unity of the Christian Serbians, leading to the disintegration of Yugoslavia, whose territorial integrity was once guaranteed against the expansionist Soviet Union during the Cold War period? Many questions that the people in Yerevan asked visiting Armenian Americans remained unanswered. The people of Yerevan are afraid that Turkey will take advantage of the circumstances to conduct a further anti-Kurdish campaign in the Kurdish region of Turkey and encourage the Azeris to conduct anti-Armenian campaigns in Karabagh. The U.S. is already writing off Turkey's five-billion-dollar military debt, and the Bush administration may lift sanctions against Azerbaijan with the elimination of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. With instructions from Ankara, Azeri propagandists are inflaming the situation in the Caucasus and are falsely accusing Armenia and Karabagh Armenians of conducting terrorism and training terrorists against Azerbaijan, and preparing the ground for military aggression. Turkey's conduct in this matter is deplorable and against the spirit of TARC. BOGUS CLAIMS After receiving red-carpet treatment in Ankara, Azeri Defense Minister General Safar Sabiyev declared that he anticipates Turkish military assistance in the event of re-ignition of the Armenian-Azeri conflict and called Armenia a terrorist state. When officials in Baku and General Sabiyev were calling Armenia a terrorist state, the visiting Chief of the Russian General Headquarters, General Anatoly Kvashnin, suggested to check the mental abilities of the claimers that Armenia is a terrorist country. The people of Yerevan are convinced that the days of Osama bin Laden and his cohorts, collaborators and sympathizers are numbered, be they in Chechnya, Azerbaijan, Central Asia, Middle East, Asia or Africa. The U.S. is determined to eradicate terrorism; little Armenia and the Armenian people genuinely and whole-heartedly support the US-led coalition efforts to bring Osama bin Laden and his collaborators to justice. Contrary to the position of Baku and Ankara, Yerevan is not expecting any favors; Armenians merely will be most appreciative, if common sense prevails in Washington and Section 907 is maintained in order not to reward the perpetrators of pogroms and the war in Karabagh, and authors of the blockade, thus discouraging Azerbaijan from conducting aggression once more against the peace-loving people of Karabagh, which was subject to stale-sponsored terrorism not so long ago, which cost 35,000 lives between 1988 and 1994. As many states and governments are taking part in this anti-terrorist coalition, let's hope that Armenian leaders, both in Armenia and the Diaspora, will take measures to protect Armenia and the Armenian nation against any potential individual or state-sponsored terrorism. Since Armenia is located in the center of a very dangerous world, it is imperative that we all should be informed and involved.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-10-13,1
"The Pope's Visit to Armenia: A View from Inside; Historic Visit is Cause for New Understanding of Armenian Church & Its Place in Christendom, World Civilization & Individual Lives Pope John Paul II's visit to Armenia in the shadow of the magnificent biblical Mount Ararat was not only full of symbolism but has opened a new chapter in the history of the relations between Christian churches. Looking at the jubilant crowds that gathered to welcome the Roman Catholic pontiff in the streets of Yerevan, Armenia's capital, an outside observer would hardly know that John Paul II, who came to participate in the celebrations of the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity in Armenia, was visiting an Orthodox stronghold and not a Catholic country. This was especially remarkable because, in the past, the two churches have clashed on many doctrinal issues. Throughout the Middle Ages, especially during the Crusades, the Armenian Church fought off several attempts at Latinization. At the same time, the Armenian Church in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia played a critical role in facilitating cultural and scientific exchanges between the East and the West. In the 19th century, intensive missionary activity by the Catholic Church in the Armenian communities of Ottoman Turkey created friction between the two churches. During this period, Armenian Catholics grew in number and eventually became an autonomous church affiliated with Roman Catholicism. Yet, by the grace of God, the sister churches have been able to put aside their differences and embrace each other. John Paul II's visit has been seen by many in Armenia as a final recognition by the Roman Catholic Church of the role and contribution of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church to the wider body of Christian churches. It followed by Pope's Apostolic Letter of February 2, 2001, in which John Paul II recognized Armenia as the first Christian nation and praised its contribution to Christendom and world civilization: I would especially like to thank the Armenians for their long history of fidelity to Christ, a fidelity that has known persecution and martyrdom, John Paul II wrote. The children of Christian Armenia shed their blood for the Lord, but through their sacrifice the whole Church grew and was strengthened... If today the West can freely profess its faith, this is also due to those who sacrificed themselves, making their bodies a bulwark for the Christian world to its furthest reaches. Their death was the price of our safety... The Armenian people's heritage of faith and culture has enriched humanity with treasures of art and genius that have now spread throughout the world. Seventeen hundred years of evangelization make this land one of the cradles of Christian civilization, which is revered and admired by all the disciples of the divine Teacher, the Pope acknowledged. The Armenian Church is among the world's most ancient continuously operating institutions, dating back to the apostolic mission of Sts. Thaddeus and Bartholomew in the middle of the first century. In 301 AD Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt. Christianity as a state religion. Armenia was baptized into the Christian faith by King Trdat III, 12 years before the Roman Empire ceased persecuting Christianity, which went on to become the dominant faith in Europe. Along with the Coptic, Ethiopian and Syriac churches, the Armenian Church belongs to the family of Oriental Orthodox churches, which remained true to the original apostolic teachings, refusing to recognize the doctrine of Christ's dual human and divine natures adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. While the Armenian Church has seen many centennial celebrations, the present 1700th-anniversary celebration is particularly significant. For one thing, it coincides with the start of the Third Christian Millennium. It also coincides with the emergence of a renewed Armenian state after 600 years of statelessness, and in the aftermath of the hardships of the 20th century that threatened the very existence of the Armenian Church, state and people. The 1700th-anniversary celebration gives us yet another opportunity for renewal and reflection, for a better understanding of our faith, our church and its place in our lives, in Christendom and in world civilization. Many Armenians believe that the adoption of Christianity saved them in more than one way. The Armenian Church survived as the only national institution after the destruction of Armenian statehood in the Middle Ages. It acted not only as a repository and guardian of the Armenian language and culture, but also united and represented all Armenians scattered throughout the world. The church also became a major driving force behind Armenia's significant cultural achievements. The creation of a distinct Armenian alphabet by St. Mesrob Mashtotz in 406 A.D. led to an unprecedented flourishing of Armenian literature, arts, music, science and engineering. Ironically, the period of European history known as the Dark Ages coincides with the period in Armenian history described as the Golden Age. The celebration of the 1700th anniversary of Armenia's adoption of Christianity is also an occasion to reflect on the role of the Armenian Church in the reconciliation of Christian churches. The possibility of the latter was poignantly demonstrated by His Holiness Pope John Paul II's visit to Armenia. As a church that has established excellent relations with its sister Orthodox, Catholic and Protestant churches, as well as with many Muslim denominations (with which we have co-existed side by side for the last 1,300 years), the Armenian Church has a great deal to offer in inter-church and inter-faith dialogue. One can only pray and hope that the example of the Armenian Church might become a template for the eventual reconciliation of other Christian churches, and for a deeper and more meaningful dialogue with the Muslim world.","Derderian, Hovnan",Armenian Reporter International,2001-10-06,1
"Armenia 2001, Jubilee Year and Year of Terrorism - Part I of III It has been a very special year for Armenians, preceded by a new era of national awakening to reclaim Armenian national rights. Armenia and the Diaspora celebrated the 10th anniversary of the independence of the third Republic and the 1700th anniversary of the proclamation of Christianity as state religion. Festivities in Yerevan and Etchmiadzin signified the resurrection of the Armenian spirit and determination to continue on the path of national liberation from foreign dominance and establishment of a free and united Armenia for all Armenians. The slogan was one nation, one church and one homeland. Many foreign religious and secular dignitaries and visitors from the Diaspora participated in these special events and witnessed the spiritual, physical, and intellectual strength of a nation which has refused to die and is determined to prevail against all man-made obstacles, including invasions, occupations, and physical and cultural genocide. The people of Armenia are strong, determined, spirited, patriotic and well educated. They have a sophisticated philosophy of life and political insight and instinct, and can distinguish good from evil. When the terrorists struck the World Trade Center and Pentagon and tried to undermine the civilized world order, the people of Armenia not only felt deep sorrow, being victims of the state-sponsored terrorism, but they also felt close and genuine affinity to the victims of this carnage. Armenian men and women stood together in silence at the beginning of all religious or non-religious ceremonies, concerts and commemorations, and paid their spontaneous tribute to those innocent victims of terrorism. MOVING EXPERIENCES It was a moving experience to hear the expressions of sorrow and solidarity with the American people during the Sunday church services, the blessing of the Holy Muron at Etchmiadzin, consecration of the St. Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral in Yerevan, and the jubilee-year celebratory festivities in the stadium and sport complex. It was most touching to see the common people on the street, including children and elderly with their own personal and social problems, trying to comfort the visiting Americans and expressing their sorrow and solidarity. It was quite moving, when an American Catholic priest from the U.S., who was visiting Armenia along with a group of Diaspora Armenians, shed tears in front of the Eternal Flame at the Genocide Memorial, when he stated This shouldn't have been, now I truly understand what genocide, is. His voice was choking when he bowed his head to the victims of the Genocide and those who died in the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Terrorism, sponsored by fanatic individuals, groups, organizations or, particularly, by the state, is an evil act from which millions of innocent people have suffered down through the centuries. Man's inhumanity against man has no boundaries. Armenians, having firsthand experience with this, understand well that the source of terrorism has to be eradicated; the cause of terrorism has to be identified, and immediate actions have to be taken to protect mankind and civilization. For this, it is imperative that, for political expediency, the double standards and selectivity that were applied in the past should be abandoned for higher standards, and both present and past perpetrators of inhumanity against man, including the organizers of the Armenian Genocide, have to be condemned and punished. The recent terrorist attacks in New York and Washington show that no one is immune. Strong measures must be taken to set a precedent that the perpetrators of any kind will not go unpunished and they will pay a heavy price for their crimes. ARMENIANS WELL INFORMED The people of Armenia are well aware of the chronology and events of the Wahabis movement, of millionaire terrorist Osama bin Laden's rise to power and his sinister intentions to harm Christians, Jews, Russians, Western countries and the U.S. Osama bin Laden's terrorist network and the participation of the Mujaheddins in the Karabagh war in Abkhasia against the Georgians, the war in Chechnya against the Russians, the terrorist kidnappings in the Caucasus and bombing of apartment buildings in Moscow and other cities in the Russian Federation, which have been going on since 1990. His al Queda Jihad movement was bankrolling Chechens, Islamic fundamentalist volunteers from Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Arabia to conduct Holy Wars against the so-called infidel Russians, Americans, Armenians, and Georgians. Afghan Mujaheddins bankrolled by Baku were fighting against the Armenians in Karabagh from 1992 to 1994. Yosef Bodansky, who was a senior editor of Defense & Foreign Affairs' Strategy Policy (now Director of the US Congressional Task Force on Terrorism & Unconventional Warfare), wrote a very informative article about the situation, entitled The New Azerbaijan Hub in the October 1999 issue. According to Bondansky, the World Assembly of Islamic Youth, The International Organization of Islamic Foundation have established headquarters in Baku, where Islamic fundamentalist terrorists are indoctrinated and trained to conduct terrorist activities and subversion in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Russia proper. The aim was to create Islamic states in territories controlled by Russia, such Chechnya, Daghestan, Ingushetya, Chuvashia, Kabardino Balkaria, Tataristan and Nagorno Karabagh. They were also conducting subversion in the Central Asian republics of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan. According to the author, the team of Islamic Jihad traveled twice to Baku, and to the Azerbaijani-Daghestan and Azerbaijani-Chechen borders, and carefully studied the situation on the ground. TERRORISTS' AIMS Terrorists such as Chechen Shamil Basev, Saudi Osama bin Laden, the Jordanian Khatab, the Turkish citizen Rejeb Yeghid, and many others were conducting organized joint efforts to stage terrorism and subversion to undermine the civilized world order. Their aim was based on many factors, such as serving the cause of Islamic fundamentalism and waging a war of liberation in Muslim regions which they perceive to be under the yoke of infidels or secular government who are the puppets of the U.S., Russia or Armenia (they mean Karabagh - M.A.) It is interesting that Joseph Bodansky, even in 1999, knew what was going on in that part of the world. The connection between Osama bin Laden, Azerbaijan and extremists in Turkey are now becoming the topic of discussion, only after the unfortunate carnage in World Trade Center and Pentagon on September 11, 2001. The Armenians and Russians were not the only targets. Why were three years of precious time wasted to finally realize that these terrorists are after the civilized world order? This was the question the people of Armenia were asking. The people of Armenia are now pleased that finally civilized Russia and the US are determined to work together to eradicate terrorism. OSAMA BIN LADEN'S TURKISH CONNECTION After reading Aristide D. Caratzas's article, the reader becomes aware that Osama bin Laden visited Turkey twice in 1996 and again in 1998, even though he was wanted by Interpol. According to the author, it was certain that Turkish Security Forces were aware, not only of his arrival and contacts with businessmen and leaders of the officially tolerated fascist Grey Wolf organization, but also his involvement in training Muslim terrorists in at least four camps on occupied Cyprus. According to Mr. Caratzas, This information has been gathered in an illuminating and detailed article titled 'Secret Collaboration between bin Laden and the Turks,' published on September 25 in the Athenian newspaper Espresso. Azeri and Turkish collaboration with Osama bin Laden apparently was aimed at undermining the security of the Russian Federation and Armenia, and pro-Russian governments of Central Asia, which refused to bow to Turkish demands to create an anti-Russian coalition. According to Mr. Caratzas, At first glance, it may appear that this information is leaked in order to lessen the impact on the Turkish regime of such revelations. Conceivably it may be argued that bin Laden contacts took place under a group no longer in power. Yet we all know that Osama bin Laden's followers are among Grey Wolf (nationalist Turkish paramilitary organization) followers in Azerbaijan and Turkey as well; they all are looking for the opportunity to strike again against American, Russian and Armenian targets. Walter Pincus, a Washington Post staff writer, writes in the September 30, 2001 issue that Bin Laden seeks instability in the Middle East, and he mentions Recruits for Chechnya followed an established route, starting first in Turkey, where bin Laden operatives maintained a guesthouse, and then moving across the Black Sea to Baku in Azerbaijan to another safe house. The people of Armenia are amazingly well informed and they are hoping that the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission's Armenian members will raise these legitimate issues with the Turks, since terrorism undermines the very foundation of all civilized nations.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-10-06,1
"Pope Paul, in Historic Visit to Armenia, Lauds Armenian Church at Start of Historic Trip Pope John Paul II spoke of a moment of grace and Joy on Tuesday as he embarked on a long-awaited visit to Armenia, becoming the first head of the Roman Catholic Church to set foot on the soil of the first Christian state in the world. Using what Armenian political and religious leaders described as a historic occasion, he paid tribute to the glorious history of Christianity in the Caucasus country at the start of a three-day trip which is expected to cement the Vatican's growing ties with the Armenian Apostolic Church. In greeting you, my esteem and friendship extend not only to the Armenians living here in your homeland, but also to the millions scattered throughout the world who remain faithful to their heritage and identity and today look to their land of origin with renewed pride and gladness, the pontiff said on his arrival at the Yerevan airport. The whole Catholic Church shares your deep joy and the joy of all Armenians on the Seventeen Hundredth Anniversary of the proclamation of Christianity as the official religion of this cherished land. The Pope was greeted on the airport tarmac by President Robert Kocharian and Catholicos Karekin II. The three men then stepped onto a covered podium to address over a hundred government officials, high-ranking clerics and foreign diplomats attending the ceremony. This visit is of a historical nature in terms of expanding and deepening still further the relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Vatican, Kocharian declared. We welcome the strengthening of relations between the Vatican and the Armenian Apostolic Church, enriched as they are by centuries of tradition between sister Churches, he said, adding that the Pope's presence adds a special significance to the ongoing celebrations of the Christian jubilee. His Holiness Karekin II, for his part, noted that the two ancient churches are bound by a Fraternal spirit. He said: Let us pray together, Beloved Brother in Christ, that your pilgrimage may strengthen the relations of our Churches further and may the bonds of love make our cooperation fruitful. John Paul and Karekin met separately at the latter's headquarters in Etchmiadzin. The focal point of the first-ever papal trip to Armenia is the newly consecrated cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator in Yerevan where the two religious heads held an ecumenical service on Wednesday. The pontiff is also scheduled to celebrate a Catholic mass in Etchmiadzin on Thursday for the tiny Armenian Catholic community. For Armenians, most of whom belong to the Apostolic Church, the papal visit is a welcome recognition of their contribution to the Christian faith and an opportunity to attract the international media spotlight to yearlong events marking the 1700th anniversary. The Pope paid special attention to the anniversary in his speech, which he began and finished in Armenian. He said: For ever, the annals of the universal Church will say that the people of Armenia were the first as a whole people to embrace the grace and truth for the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. You zealously guard the memory of your many martyrs: indeed, martyrdom has been the special mark of the Armenian Church and the Armenian people. A rapprochement between the Armenian them began in December 1996 with the signing in the Vatican of a joint statement that put an end to an old theological dispute. The dispute had led the Armenian and other denominations of the so-called oriental family to split from the Universal Church in 451 A.D. - long before the 11th-century Great Schism that gave birth to Roman Catholicism and Greek Orthodoxy. The Armenian Church has since been fully independent and currently maintains good relations with all Christian denominations. In a joint communiqué issued after their meeting in the Vatican last November, John Paul and Karekin II vowed to further deepen the fraternal relations. The statement also referred to the 1915 mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire as a genocide, in what amounted to the Vatican's recognition of the tragedy. The pontiff said on Tuesday that Armenians were subjected to unspeakable terror and suffering in the 20th century but stopped short of calling the slaughter of some 1.5 million Ottoman Armenians a genocide. He laid a wreath on Wednesday at Yerevan's Tsitsernakabert memorial to the victims of the mass killings. The Pope flew in from Kazakhstan on the second leg of a trip which has been dominated by his concerns that the world may slide into war, following the attacks in New York and Washington two weeks ago. In mostly Muslim Kazakhstan, he spoke of the great respect the Catholic Church had for Islam. In Armenia, he is expected to urge reconciliation among Christian denominations. The 81-year-old pontiff maintains a busy travel schedule despite declining health. He was able to walk off the plane in Yerevan unaided. But witnesses said he looked extremely tired after arriving at the main Armenian cathedral in Etchmiadzin to lead a joint prayer service with Karekin II. The Pope faltered and was unable to complete a speech there. A priest finished reading John Paul's prepared text as the pope sat slumped on a throne on the cathedral's altar, according to the Associated Press. Reuters said the Pope later appeared better when he visited the tombs of Armenian church leaders and entered his residence on the complex to rest before his next engagement.","Danielyan, Emil",Armenian Reporter International,2001-09-29,1
"Belfast Muslims Under Attack MEMBERS of Belfast's Muslim community have been suffering increased harassment in the backlash against last week's massacre in the U.S. The city's Muslims arrived for prayers at the Belfast Islamic Center, the North's largest mosque, to find the windows smashed. And many other followers of Islam have complained of being verbally abused as they go about their daily business. Several have reported a build-up of anxiety in their community in the run-up to the predicted American military reaction to the attacks. Jamal Iweid, president of the Islamic Center, said he had noticed a marked difference in the attitude of people following last Tuesday's tragic events in the U.S. Jamal, who discovered the two broken windows in the center at Wellington Park near the city center, said on one recent occasion as he walked in downtown Belfast with his wife and young son, two young women had looked strangely at them and talked loudly of bombing in New York. On another occasion, he said, he was on his way to a television station to give an interview when he was accosted by young men in their early 20s who hurled racist abuse at him. Our activities here in the Belfast Islamic Center have been rather affected. Some people are afraid to come to the mosque because they think the mosque is a target. We had our Sunday school and very few children turned up. We believe that was because many parents are worried about the safety of their children, he says. We should not, as a Muslim community in Belfast, be victimized for something that we have not done and we do not support. We condemn any act against any innocent civilians in the world. We should not be victimized just because some people did something somewhere else in the world. We have nothing to do with that. The harassment of Belfast Muslims, who come mainly from the Indian sub-continent, Africa, the Middle East and Far East, was condemned by SDLP Assembly member Carmel Hanna, whose south Belfast constituency takes in the student bed-sitter land where many overseas visitors live. It think it's disgraceful and I would utterly condemn it. I'm sure I speak for most residents of south Belfast, if not all. The Islamic community is part of our community and is part of the diversity of our community. We don't just tolerate them, we support and encourage that community here, she said. Meanwhile, dozens of remembrance services have been held across the North to pray for the thousands of people who perished in Tuesday's attacks. In Fermanagh, exactly one week after the mass murders in the U.S., representatives of the Catholic, Church of Ireland, Methodist and Presbyterian churches gathered for a special service in the Bill Clinton Peace Center. Poignantly, the naming of the center -- in honor of the former United States president's role in the Irish peace process -- took place in May when Clinton visited Enniskillen, Co. Fermanagh, the scene of the Remembrance Day (Veterans' Day) bombing when 11 people were killed. On Monday night St. Eugene's Cathedral in Derry City was packed for a special Mass dedicated to the victims of the attacks. Bishop Frances Lagan asked the congregation to contrast the evil of those behind the atrocities with the heroic work of the rescue teams. People feel the need to do something to show sympathy and the best way we can show our solidarity and our sympathy for those who have been lost and those who are mourning and grieving is by praying for them, he said. As a limited number of international flights resumed, U.S.-bound passengers who were stranded after their planes were diverted to Canada have been returning home. Among them was hard-line Ulster Unionist anti-Agreement Member of Parliament (MP) Jeffrey Donaldson, who had been part of a delegation intent on briefing U.S. politicians on the arrest of three Irish Republicans in Colombia in August. Back home in Co. Armagh once more, Donaldson said he had been stranded with 10,000 other passengers, many of them Americans, in Gander, Canada. There was a very sad, but yet angry mood amongst those American travelers. They were also very fearful, I think, of the consequences for their country and for them as individuals, he said.","Anderson, Brendan",Irish Voice,2001-09-25,1
"Ireland Cautions Over U.S. Retaliation IRELAND has not given a blank check in its support for the U.S. response to last week's terrorist attacks in New York, Washington, D.C. and Pennsylvania. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern said that the U.S. response must not be merciless or indiscriminate. Ireland is to take over the chair of the UN Security Council in the coming weeks, and in that capacity the government has been cautious about giving unconditional support. In a special session of the Dail (Irish Parliament) this week, the Taoiseach said he hoped that the international community would ensure that they are not sowing the seeds for even greater catastrophes in the future. It is imperative that whatever actions are taken are clearly seen as measured, as targeting terrorism at its source and based on clear evidence, Ahern said. The temptation immediately to lash out with all available military might has been resisted. I am certain that the United States will wish to avoid civilian casualties that might indeed compound an already difficult problem. They understand the importance of ensuring that the response to these horrendous events be proportionate, measured and focused on the pursuit of justice, he added. Labour Party leader Ruairi Quinn said any military response should be done in accordance with international law and on the basis of the greatest degree of international consensus. It is perfectly understandable that, in the United States and elsewhere, there should be a wish to lash out in response to these terrible, terrible acts. Restraint in the face of provocation and assault is a sign not of weakness, but of strength. I believe that the objective should be to bring to justice those responsible and to see the destruction of the organization and apparatus used to organise and carry out these evil deeds. There has been an incredible outpouring of grief and support in the wake of last Tuesday's attack. President Mary McAleese summed up the feelings of the nation when she said the attacks were a crime against the very foundations of all our humanity and our hearts. In a very emotional interview outside the presidential residence within hours of the attack, she said, I am like every human being with any scrap of human decency and any scrap of human compassion. I'm watching pictures and it's absolutely unbearable. Our response to that is, and has to be, to stand shoulder to shoulder with our American brothers and sisters. Thousands of people are in mourning after their friends and family members were killed in the attack. On Friday almost every business in the country closed its doors as a mark of respect to the dead and their families. Tens of thousands flocked to the American Embassy in Dublin to express their sympathy. But the national day of mourning was not welcomed by everyone. One large employer wrote to the Taoiseach to complain that the government had played into the hands of terrorists by declaring a national day of mourning. Your decision which is not echoed in any state so far, is loading further cost on to businesses in Ireland and has only added to the havoc which these irresponsible terrorists wanted to inflict, Klaus Nolke, the director of one of the largest businesses in Kerry, Liebherr Container Cranes, complained. There is major concern at the impact the attacks will have on the Irish economy. Aer Lingus announced that it was to cut 25% of its routes in a bid to stave off bankruptcy at the national airline. The number of Americans coming to Europe is expected to drop by as much as 50% in the coming year. Ireland had already been suffering from the slowdown in the U.S. economy. In recent months there had been many job losses in hi-tech companies as plants closed or scaled back operations. That situation is expected to get worse. The political implications of the terrorist attack are also massive. The U.S. interest in the peace process will automatically wane, and Sinn Fein will come under particular pressure as the new world order refuses to tolerate terrorism of any shade. The arrest of the three suspected IRA men in Colombia will also be closely scrutinized. Singer Christy Moore launched a campaign to bring the three home, earlier this week. A concert was held in Dublin and attended by among others the Green party Member of European Parliament Patricia McKenna and Independent Dail member Tony Gregory to highlight their case. But they can expect little support given what has happened in the last week. The effect of the attacks has also had a huge impact on Ireland's growing Muslim community, many of whom have been subject to racist taunts in the past week. Media reports linking Osama bin laden to Muslims living in Ireland have been dismissed as absolutely irresponsible and appalling by a government spokesman.","Carey, Mairead",Irish Voice,2001-09-25,1
"Faces and Places: I believe in Ukraine Ukraine lives! The nation-state established by the people of Ukraine has survived for 10 years - longer than at any time in history. This is truly a time to rejoice, to celebrate, to dance for joy, to sing and shout. The dreams of thousands of diaspora Ukrainians were finally realized in August of 1991 when well over 90 percent of the people of Ukraine voted for independence. How delighted we all were to know that Ukraine finally had a government that was beholden to no foreign power - not Moscow, not Warsaw, not anyone. The first few years of Ukrainian independence were exhilarating. The Communist Party was outlawed and it was as if the gates of hell were thrown open and heaven was around the corner. Ukrainians could travel freely. They could say what they wished, write what they wanted and read what they pleased. They could build churches and worship where and however their convictions dictated. The elixir of freedom was intoxicating, and we all had our fill after a long, long dry spell. Our joy was not to last. Slowly and almost imperceptibly, things began to change. Thanks to pressure from the West, the Communist Party was legalized. Ukrainians were informed that democracies should tolerate all political parties. Legalization allowed the same Communist thugs who oppressed the Ukrainian people during Soviet times to make a comeback. They allied themselves with criminals and charlatans. Soon the Communists were the major power in the Verkhovna Rada. Some elections were rigged. Some government officials proved to be swindlers, pirates, corrupt to the core. Honest presidential candidates met with unfortunate accidents and died. Some journalists critical of the government were either murdered or simply disappeared. As crooked government officials and oligarchs built obscene new houses and dachas with stolen money, doctors, teachers, engineers and skilled workers weren't paid for months. Old people were swindled out of their apartments to make room for Ukraine's new criminal class. Confiscatory taxes were leveled against honest businessmen. Monies were siphoned out of the economy and stashed in foreign bank accounts. Unemployment soared. Anyone who could, fled, and the population of Ukraine declined, along with the average life span. We in the diaspora watched Ukraine's degradation with growing dismay. This couldn't be happening, we told ourselves. The people of Ukraine are like us. They're good people, religious people, hard-working people. Independence wasn't supposed to be like this. How naive we were. We didn't realize that our vision of an independent Ukraine was different from the vision of Ukraine's bosses. We couldn't understand that their values, their aspirations, were different from ours. We yearned for freedom, justice and civility. They were driven by a lust for power. Our disillusionment was soon followed by anger. We yearned to know what went wrong while fearing the worst. Things will get better, we rationalized. Ukraine cannot change overnight. Slowly and reluctantly, however, we began to confront reality. Gradually and ever so hesitantly we became openly critical of our beloved Ukraine, the same Ukraine we waited all of our lives to see independent. Give us time, replied officials in Ukraine. We held back again, fearful lest our condemnations hurt Ukraine's chances for Western assistance. But when life in Ukraine continued to decline, when the situation went from bad to worse, we became even more vocal. And this really angered certain officials over there. How dare you? What right do you have to judge us? We don't need your advice, they responded. The fact of the matter is that we in the diaspora not only have the right but the obligation to call attention to the outrages currently being perpetrated against the people of Ukraine. Think about it. While many of Ukraine's present leaders were happily singing The International, we in the diaspora were passionately proclaiming Sche Ne Vmerla Ukraina. While they enthusiastically exhibited their hammer and sickle medals and banners, we proudly displayed the trident. They spoke Russian. We spoke Ukrainian. They destroyed churches. We built them. They waved the red-and-blue flag of Soviet Ukraine. We marched with blue-and-yellow flags. They celebrated the October Revolution. We commemorated the declarations of 1918 and 1941. They fought for a Marxist-Leninist world. We sent our sons and daughters to fight Communists in Korea and Vietnam. I ask you: Who has more of a moral right to speak out, Ukraine's present nomenklatura or us? Complaining is not enough, however. We must continue to help Ukraine find its way. And we must maintain our faith, the same faith that sustained us in the past. We need to believe in Ukraine's future greatness. I believe that someday Ukraine will be a nation of laws, not of oligarchs and petty bureaucrats more interested in their own personal aggrandizement than in the welfare of the people of Ukraine. I believe that someday Ukraine will have a president who will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, especially those provisions that call for freedom of speech and the press. I believe that someday Ukraine will have a justice system that will provide equal protection for all, not just the rich and powerful. I believe that Ukraine will one day establish an economic system predicated on natural and human resource development, free markets and honorable individual initiative. I believe that the people of Ukraine will finally come to grips with their Soviet past, identify the most egregious crimes of the Soviet horror and punish the perpetrators. I believe that the Orthodox people of Ukraine will forget their personal differences and ambitions and unite into one powerful Ukrainian Orthodox Church. I also believe that all Ukrainians of faith - Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Jew and Muslim alike - will come to respect each other and realize that there is but one God. I believe all this because it's true. Ukraine has a long history of survival against the greatest of odds. And things are better in Ukraine today than they were 10 years ago. They really are. I am convinced that the people of Ukraine will weather the present crisis and live to experience a glorious and fulfilling future. Slava Ukraini!","Kuropas, Myron B",Ukrainian Weekly,2001-09-02,0
"Misinformation and Public Relations One of the most important branches of any government in the world is the National Security Council, which directly deals with external and internal security matters. Representatives of military and foreign policy services, intelligence and counterintelligence agencies, national security and foreign policy advisors make up the National Security Council. The Council's main function is to integrate domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to national security. In totalitarian regimes, Council members are appointed by the ruler (director) and have unlimited arbitrary powers. In democratic countries, although the Council remains powerful, its selected member candidates are subjected to approval by the country's legislators. After close scrutiny and questioning by congressional commissions, their final assignment requires approval through the vote of legislators. In the US, NSC (National Security Council) and NSA (National Security Agency) membership includes the President, Vice President, Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, Later, the CIS (Central Intelligence Agency), under the NSC, was also created through the National Security Act. The task of the intelligence services is to collect data and information in foreign countries dealing with political, economic, scientific and military matters, and espionage. In political matters, they try to analyze the political stability of the given country, the popularity of politicians and their political orientation and friendliness or enmity toward a given country. They also try to influence political processes or outcomes favourable to the national interests of that given country. Economic intelligence is the most crucial one, since economic factors are critical to the nation's military strength, its political development and conduct of its foreign policy. In order to influence the recipient country's economic system and political orientation, the donor country, International Monetary Fund and World Bank use their financial muscles and demand hidden concessions, economic as well as political. In military matters, combat readiness and military potential of a given country are studied and tactical operational counter measures are taken along the national security of a given country. Espionage activities reflect the darker side of any government, which, at least, are conducted in move civilized ways by Western nations, whereas in totalitarian regimes they include political assassinations, fomenting ethnic unrest, separatism and inter-communal clashes. SPREADING MISINFORMATION & MISLEADING OPINION One of the tasks of intelligence and counterintelligence services is to spread political, social, economic, cultural, military and historical misinformation, or to mislead domestic and international public opinion to undermine the credibility and status of a competitive or adversary government or nation, in order to promote their own national security and interests. Issues, like individual liberty, human rights, national liberation, anti-totalitarianism, promotion of democratic values, self-determination and territorial integrity, are used or promoted under different variations and versions and have different meanings depending on the geopolitics and nations or geographical regions involved. Policy differences are determined according to the region's geopolitical value and are based on the given countries' economic and military potential and their leadership's political orientation and disposition. If they are friendly and willing to be included within the sphere of influence of a given powerful country, their social and democratic shortcomings are usually ignored, like the human rights violations occurring in Turkey and Azerbaijan. If the leadership of a given country is considered to be unfriendly, then their social and democratic shortcomings will be over-exaggerated and will be used against it, to undermine their public standing, like Fidel Castro of Cuba, Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus. These are the realities of today's world, where powerful states like the U.S. and Russia are trying to extend their sphere of influence and establish geopolitical control over the regions which are considered to be geostrategically important, rich in energy sources and have great economic potential with political and military implications. PLIGHT OF SMALLER STATES Smaller states, like Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Central Asian States, Israel, Greece and the Arab states, have mostly regional problems, many unresolved issues which have historical root, complicated by border disputes or occupied lands and human factors. However, they are still part of global politics. The human factors stem from past historical injustices, like deportation, massacres and genocide of ethnic groups in their native land. Land disputes stem from colonial and imperial past, when lands of natives were confiscated, occupied or annexed through force and acts of genocide. The U.S. in terms of its national security and national interests, is not interested in border disputes, national grievances, historical injustices or past atrocities, whether who is right or wrong. The U.S. is looking for regional stability in order to utilize the Caspian region's energy resources and economic potential and to neutralize the influence of other regional powers, namely Russia and Iran, while promoting Turkey's regional role. Russia, China and Iran are weary of the expanding U.S. influence, and are using regional border disputes, occupied land issues and human factors in order to prevent stability and to extend their sphere of influence by capitalizing on differences and disputes among conflicting small states. ATTEMPTS TO INFLUENCE U.S., WORLD PUBLIC OPINION In order to promote their national interests and to resolve outstanding border and other national disputes in their bilateral or multilateral relations, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Central Asian States, Israel, Greece and Arab states are using their own geopolitical position and natural resource assets to have the U.S. or Russia on their side to counterbalance the other. In order to influence the U.S. Russia and world public opinion, these smaller states are emphasizing that they were victimized by aggression, occupation, atrocities, genocide, ethnic discrimination, and historical injustices. Meanwhile, the aggressors are denying any responsibility and calling the charges historically inaccurate. By capitalizing on and monopolizing the genocide factor, the Jews were successful in gaining Western and American sympathy and secure financial compensation from the perpetrators. Although being the first victim of genocide, the Armenians were unsuccessful in securing the same kind of financial compensation, and their attempts to gain legislative recognition by the U.S. were blocked by successive American administrations for political expediency. After reviewing these basic facts, it is useful to study the misinformation and public relations campaign by MIT (Turkish Intelligence Agency), MGK (Turkish Security Council), and Azerbaijani Intelligence Services that are so skillfully used against Armenians to undermine Western and American support for Armenia, through distortion of facts and historical realities. The Azeris and Turks are mirror imaging Armenian accusations and are incriminating Armenians with the following charges: CHARGES AGAINST ARMENIANS The Armenians, between 1896 and the present, committed atrocities, massacres, and terrorism against Turks and Azeris, misused Turkish Azeri hospitality and conspired against Ottoman and Azeri authorities. The Armenian uprising in Anatolia caused countless deaths among the Turkish-Muslim population. The massacres in Hodjali are one of the perfect examples of Armenian terrorism against Azeri-Turks. The Armenians, since 1918, are occupying Azeri-Turkish lands and constantly expanding their territory at the expense of Azeri-Turks. The former Azeri districts of Erivan (Yerevan), Zankezur-Meghri, were given to Armenians by Soviets and currently Armenian aggressors invaded twenty percent of Azeri territory, including Karabagh. Armenian Genocide claims have no historical validity, it is pure Armenian fabrication to hide their hideous crimes against Azeri and Turkish people. Armenian allegations that they are native indigenous people of Anatolia and Karabagh are false; they are the newcomers and invaders of the Turkish lands and they have no historical rights to these lands. Armenians are destroying historical Azeri and Islamic monuments in Armenia and Karabagh. Ironically even Turks are accusing Armenians of conducting marble mine explosions on the borders and causing destruction in Ani, ancient capital of medieval Armenia. Armenians are involved in international terrorism and are training and harboring PKK-Kurdish terrorists in Armenia and Karabagh. Armenians are involved in drug trafficking in the Caucasus. Armenians are dumping nuclear waste in Armenian-occupied Azeri territory. Armenians have pro-Russian orientation, they are stooges of Moscow and they are anti-Western. Though joint Turkish-Azeri efforts, signatures are being collected in the European Parliament, recommending recognition of the so-called genocide of Azeris committed by the Armenians in 1918 and 1988-1994. During a Pan-Islamic conference in Mali, Africa, Turks and Azeris spearheaded condemnation of Armenia as aggressor and occupant of twenty percent of Azeri national territory (excluding Karabagh proper, seven percent of Azeri territory is held by Armenians as a security zone.) ANTI-ARMENIAN PROPAGANDA CONTINUES Following the establishment of the government-controlled Armenian Studies Center in Ankara, Turks are now publishing anti-Armenian propaganda materials and books along the aforementioned lines to discredit Armenian charges against them. The publications are devoid of any academic and historical value and standards. Obviously, Ankara's intention is not academic research or to conduct dialogue or reconciliation; rather, it is justification and rationalization of their past conduct as legitimate self-defensive measures against alleged Armenian terrorism and atrocities committed on Turkish and Islamic populace. One wonders if the upcoming second Chicago conference among Armenian and Turkish historians will be able to deal with the historical accounts in the right perspective, or if the visiting Turkish academicians will continue to repeat the same lines of the forger of history Ahmet Esat Uras and anti-Armenian publications of the so-called Armenian Center in Ankara. Unlike previous gathering, credible professors Vahakn Dadrian and Richard Hovannisian are also going to take part in this conference. We will wait for the publication of the proceedings, which was promised but has not materialized after the conclusion of the first conference. In the past Armenians had to deal with revisionism and denial; now they have to learn to cope with misinformation and slanders.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-08-25,0
"The Great War and the Tragedy of Anatolia: Turks and Armenians in the Maelstrom of Major Powers The following review was published in Middle Eastern studies; London; January 2001, Volume 37, Issue l, pp. 237-240. Frank Cass & Co. Ltd., January 2001. The subject of this book is what was formerly knows as the Armenian Question and which is usually denominated nowadays by Armenian historians as the Armenian Genocide. According to an Armenian account of events, the Ottoman government set about the deliberate repression and eventual extermination of its Armenian population, culminating in the deportations and massacres of 1915. This book, however, presents a Turkish view of the matter in which the problem is seen as one of civil war between Muslims and Armenians in Anatolia, in which the Armenians were encouraged by the Great Powers, which had their own purposes, mainly economic advantage. In this civil war, which was itself part of a long Christian-Muslim struggle in the larger region of the Crimea, the Caucasus, Transcaucasia and the Ottoman lands in Europe and Asia, a conflict which lasted from the late eighteenth century until the 1920s, both sides suffered grievously, the Muslims more than the Christians. Millions were expelled from their traditional homes and very many died of violence, disease or famine. These vast demographic upheavals have been charted by Justin McCarthy in a series of books and articles and, in the present book, Professor Salahi Sonyel draws heavily on McCarthy's work. Sonyel begins with a brief sketch of Armenian history from the early eighteenth century, in which the endeavors to show that the Armenians consistently collaborated with, or spied for, the Russians against the Ottomans and Iran. So much, one would think, for the theory of the loyal Armenian millet. But then Sonyel remarks that, during the Crimean War, the majority of the Ottoman Armenians remained loyal to the Ottoman empire (p.8). The apparent contradiction highlights a general problem with this book, and that is the author's failure to distinguish regularly and consistently between different groups of Armenians. Sometimes, it is true, we read of particular groups or parties with different aims, but then the distinctions are lost and all Armenians seem to become the same. Of course, this is precisely what the Armenian terrorist bands hoped would be the result of their actions and it is also the error into which the Ottomans fell, but it is a confusion which one would have hoped that historians would avoid with more skill than is shown here. Sonyel traces the worsening situation after 1878 and especially after the formation of the Armenian revolutionary parties at the end of the 1880s. The object of the revolutionary parties was to manufacture incidents, provoke retaliation, broadcast atrocity stories and appeal for Great Power intervention. All this, of course, was and is the stock in trade of the Balkan revolutionary, from the Greek struggle for independence to the KLA, and has been copied by other revolutionaries around the world. Sonyel writes of the natural reaction of Turks but glosses over the nature of their reprisals and suggests that claims about Turkish violence are grossly exaggerated. He also indicates that the Armenian revolutionaries were not the sole source of trouble and admits that Armenians were subjected to attacks by Kurds in some rural areas, but argues that, in this, they were no different from their Muslim neighbors, who also suffered from Kurdish depredations. In 1908, the Young Turk revolution brought some hopes of Muslim-Armenian rapprochement but in 1909 the Adana incident again saw Muslims and Armenians pitted against one another. Sonyel devotes some detailed attention to the Adana affair; using Ottoman documents and British consular reports, these two sources provide the book with its greatest originality - and discusses which side started the trouble. Most blame, he considers, attaches to the Armenian revolutionaries, but he concedes a serious failure by the local Ottoman authorities to check the fighting at the outset. Sonyel also offers some useful remarks on the commission of in inquiry into the disturbances. It is hardly necessary to say that Armenian accounts of the Adana affair differ markedly from that by Sonyel. It is right that historians should look closely at the details of tragedies such as that at Adana but it is disappointing that the consideration is still dominated by questions of blame. What is needed is closer investigation of the local situation over a longer time period with a view to setting out what factors were peculiar to that region and contributed to the clashes which took place, and also the marrying of local events with national or even international events which impinged Especially on the region. A series of detailed local studies might take consideration of the historical Armenian question beyond the state achieved by broad-brush treatments, and lick the national question with the social and economic changes which were taking place in Anatolia at the time. In particular, one would like to see a study of the city and province of Van which was the center of the most active Armenian radical politics. In chapter 4, Sonyel considers the effect of the Balkan Wars of 1912-13 on the Armenian situation and the efforts of the Great Powers to persuade or oblige the Ottoman government to introduce a scheme of reforms for the six or seven (including Trabzon) eastern vilayets in which the Armenians chiefly lived. Much of the correspondence relating to the reform proposals is, of course, published in the British and German diplomatic documents, which make it clear that the Russia which make it clear that the pressure of reform came from Russian which wanted a unified eastern province, seen by the Ottomans and also the Germans as a prelude to Russian annexation desired by many Armenians. Although the eventual scheme forced on the Ottomans in February 1914 broke the proposed eastern provinces into two, it still went far towards meeting the Russian demands and imposed on the region an equality between Muslims and Christians quite unwarranted by the population figures. According to Ottoman statistics, Armenians comprised less than 20 per cent of the population of the vilayets in question; and even the Armenian Catholics claimed only 30 per cent and, for that reason, preferred annexation to Russia to autonomy. It was impossible for the Ottomans to view the scheme as other than a move towards the eventual detachment of a region principally inhabited by Muslims from the empire and it is not surprising that they dragged their heels over the implementation of plan until it was rendered irrelevant by the outbreak of war. On this chapter one would make a similar criticism to that made above about Sonyel's use of the term Armenians: it is necessary to discriminate more than he does between Great Power policies, and he would be wise to discard his attachment to a theory of the pursuit of economic advantage. When war began, the Armenians supported the Allied powers, claims Sonyel, and some Ottoman Armenians went to Russia and joined anti-Ottoman Armenian organizations. Various incidents persuaded the Ottoman 3rd Army to realize that the Armenians were plotting a rebellion (p.96). There was, alleges Sonyel, a widespread Armenian plot to rebel. Armenians deserted the Ottoman forces and took up arms as guerrillas. Accordingly, the Ottomans disarmed Armenian soldiers and put them in labor battalions. There followed Armenian atrocities against Muslim villages, revolts acts of sabotage, which tied down Ottoman forces. In Van a major Armenian uprising took place when Russian forces advanced towards that city. After the Russians took Van, the Muslim population was forced out and murderous Armenian bands ranged through the surrounding area. It was necessary for the Ottomans to do something about Armenian treachery and on 24 April 1915 it was decided to deport Armenians from strategic areas. This decision did not precede, but was the result of Armenian rebellions and guerrilla activities which threatened the very existence of the Ottoman state, Sonyel remarks. (p. 113). The Provincial Law of Reallocations was passed on 27 May and approved by the Council of Ministers on 30 May. Over the following months 700,000 were deported, of whom over half lost their lives as a result of violence, sickness, etc. Such are Sonyel's estimates: Armenians claim far larger losses. In Sonyel's version, therefore, the Armenians brought their misfortunes upon themselves. Their conduct made the deportations inevitable; the suffering which ensued was the regrettable consequence of wartime exigencies compounded by disobedient local Ottoman officials and uncontrollable Kurdish tribes themselves thirsting for vengeance upon the Armenians who had destroyed their villages. This interpretation of the Armenian massacres is, of course, quite at odds with that which circulated at the time and is put forward by Armenians and adopted by many historians. According to the more common view, the Armenians were innocent victims; in the city of Van, for example, the Armenians co-operated with the Ottoman authorities until Ottomans attacked them when they were obliged to take up arms in their own defense. In chapter 6 Sonyel looks at some of the sources of this latter view, namely the 1916 Bryce/Toynbee report on the Armenian atrocities, the diary of the US ambassador, Henry Morgenthau, and the writings of the German Protestant missionary, Dr. Lepsius. After an interesting examination, he concludes that all are tainted because they rely directly or indirectly on Armenian evidence and, in the case of the first two, they are essentially wartime propaganda. Sonyel is right to argue for a larger perspective in which the struggle between Armenians and Muslims should be placed, and right to emphasize the sufferings of Muslims. With regard to the more detailed allegations, the evidence does not allow us to pronounce with any assurance. Perhaps, eventually, evidence may emerge from Ottoman or Russian sources, which will shed further light on the events of 1914 and 1915. In the meantime one must enter a caveat about Sonyel's cavalier way with evidence which runs counter to this case. The doctrine that the testimony of a victim about crimes committed against himself or herself cannot be relied upon and should be dismissed is one which is an abhorrent as it is revolutionary. And it is hardly enough to claim that all American Protestant missionaries were so biased in favor of the Armenians that their evidence is also unreliable. They may have had much more sympathy for the Armenians than they had for the Muslims or the Ottoman authorities and they may have been misled by some Armenian reports of distant events, but some of their evidence concerns matters which they witnessed with their own eyes.

"From Northern Ireland to Yugoslavia By Laoise Mac Reamoinn LAST week in Srebenica, a village in what was once Yugoslavia, a group of 8,000 Muslim women, heavily policed by Serb troops, returned to what had been their hometown. They were there to honor and mourn their men and boys, massacred five years ago. Slobodan Milosevic is now standing trial in The Hague for this and many other war crimes perpetrated in Bosnia and Kosovo, during his tenure as president of Serbia. And as Macedonia teeters on the brink of civil war, television and newspapers once again are filled with the harrowing images of a kind of warfare we had sworn would never happen again. Inspired and haunted by what she saw and heard while visiting the war-torn region in 1993, Irish artist Michelle Rogers set to work on a series of paintings. The result is A Dark Heart, an exhibition of oil paintings, drawings, and watercolors, of staggering beauty and power, whose rich elegiac stillness resonate with history, offering silent testimony to the hollow, all-too familiar legacy of war. Rogers' show opened July 17 in Manhattan's Caelum Gallery in Chelsea, and runs through July 28. It received widespread attention and lavish praise on its recent first outing in Dublin. It is work of the highest order. I've always painted about conflict, Dundalk-born Rogers explains. Dundalk is a heavy Republican area, and even though I grew up in a non-Republican family, we always looked to the North, rather than Dublin. We were up in the North every week, up to Newry to buy magazines and sweets, and every week there were buildings that had just disappeared. It was unbelievable. The army was everywhere. This was the early 70s. I was born in `66, and I remember when I was young I had this big thing about toy guns, and the family was going to Scotland once on a trip, and we were crossing from Larne, in County Antrim. It was the day internment was introduced, and the army found my toy gun in the car, and they took the car apart. Rogers' first show, about the Gulf War, was called The Road to Basra. It started with a photograph I saw, which was of what was really the last act of the Gulf War, where - and this doesn't show America in the best light - they bombed the hell out of a convoy of retreating Iraqi soldiers. And I just saw these images, and it just struck me, and shook me. Death, the cold reality of this kind of warfare. Like computer game warfare. Rarely in the entire history of warfare have a retreating army been bombed like that. The power of Rogers' work is that she expresses her outrage without fuss or noise. There are no cheap tricks, garish images designed to shock, nor is her work violent and bloody. Instead, there is dark grandeur to these paintings. Funeral Sarajevo, has a dark and sad universality, and Library Sarajevo shows the great books reduced to a pile of ash in the center of an imposing, once noble building. But something magic is at work here too. Using a range of colors that are saturated in warmth - blues, purples, golden yellows - Rogers lets the other colors, the relentless grays and blacks, stand in all their aching despair. But they do not dominate. A Dark Heart is an unforgettable exhibition. A Dark Heart: Paintings by Michelle Rogers, is at Caelum Gallery, 526 West 26th St. Suite 315, from July 17-28.

"Pilgrimage in Anatolia and Armenia The pilgrimage in Anatolia and Armenia is the outcome of the process initiated by the Turkish Armenia Business Development Council (TABDC) and the Diocese of the Armenian Church of America two years ago. We are all happier because this historical trip takes place in 201. 150 US. Armenian pilgrims arrived in Istanbul on June 5. The pilgrims traveled in the footsteps of Saint Gregory, across southeastern and eastern Anatolia before going to Yerevan. June 7: Morning The plane carrying the 150 pilgrims from Istanbul to Kayseri has just landed TABDC has planned to travel with the 4th group. We are about 80 people and we will travel in two buses. The first stop is Malatya; the next stops are Arapkir, Elazig, Mush, Diyarbakyr, Bitlis, Van, Dogubeyazyt, Igdyr and Kars. We will leave our friends at the Turkish-Armenian border. My purpose is to share our feelings with you. I will do my best to avoid any comment and just try to bring to you the very moments full of emotions. I invite all of you to cross Anatolia from Kayseri to Kars with our Armenian pilgrim friends. June 7: Arrival in Kayseri, visit to Cappadocia A full-day visit to Cappadocia. Saint Gregory started his long journey from Caesarea. The national and regional media are waiting for us: TABDC was convinced that such an important event as our pilgrimage in Anatolia has to be given media coverage. Nevertheless we didn't expect the media to pay such great attention to us. This attention by the media makes every one feel even more responsible: it has become impossible for us to act as tourists even in such a place as Cappadocia: We are very well aware of our mission from the very beginning of the trip. The TV journalists have joined us in our visit to Cappadocia. Armen, Lusine and Father Vertanes Kalayjian are very much at ease when speaking in front of the TV cameras. The journalists can't hide their surprise when they hear some of our friends expressing themselves in Turkish. 97-year-old Lusine tells us about her life story: She lives in Philadelphia. Her family left Gaziantep and went to Aleppo when she was 9 months old. The reason she took part in this trip? My mother, father and I were born in Antep. I have never been to Antep yet. I would like to go and see, if I go to Antep I can see if any Armenians still live there. She adds that arguing about the past won't bring anything to either Turks or Armenians. Father Kalayjian's family comes from Kilis, he spent his childhood in Hatay. Father Kalayjian feels very sorry that his Turkish is so poor: I know that my Turkish is not that polite!. Armen tells about the importance of this trip: We have been separated from our roots. Turkey has been forbidden land for all of us for a very long time. Today, the political changes open new windows of opportunity. To come and see the country, to meet the people of the country...when you go back, you are a different person. It becomes quite impossible to hate a person that you know and to whom you feel that much close. Some of us are from a small village called Tomarza. Being in Kayseri and being so close to the village where their parents came from and not going there is not possible! The governor of Tomarza welcomes the group and allows them to hold a religious service in the old church. June 8: Morning in Kayseri It is 8:30 a.m. and we have to leave early to be on time at the religious services in the Armenian church of Kayseri. Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of the Armenian Church of America, who arrived in Istanbul the day before, is going to lead the ceremony. The Patriarch of Istanbul is also in Kayseri to take part in the services. The warm welcoming messages of the governor and mayor of Kayseri open the services. Some Armenians from Istanbul have decided to come to Kayseri on this special day. I can't take my eyes off the man standing next to me: he seems very much touched by the ceremony and he is not into our group. I go up to him and ask where he is from. He says he lives in Istanbul and that his family was from Marash and adds that he has never been to Anatolia before: If only you could understand what this ceremony means to me! He is right, I wouldn't have imagined that it could have been so exceptional for someone living in Istanbul to come and pray in a church in Kayseri. A family, which is apparently Muslim, has been listening to the religious services in Armenian, suddenly looks at me and says: How great it would be to speak several languages! The service is about to end. In the garden, two young women have come with the same request: they are also waiting for the priest to bless them. Two of our group, speaking fluent Turkish, take them by the hand and introduce them to the priest. I go up to three men standing next to the entrance and ask them if they live in Kayseri. Yes, they are from Kayseri: I haven't been in this church for a very long time, it has changed a lot. It's so beautiful. There is usually no religious service in this church. We heard that some visitors were coming and we wanted to see them, one of them explains to me. I start giving them some information about our trip. A man who has kept silent wants to know if anyone of us speaks German: I speak German very well, he adds and goes on welcoming us in German. Two Armenians from Istanbul and one from California, standing next to me, get into conversation with us. They say that their parents were born in Kayseri. I take a step back and listen to them carefully: Do you know our Hagop? is the way the conversation starts. In a few minutes, they come up with a long list of mutual friends. As the three men are about to level, one of them turns to me and whispers: What you are doing is very important, please go on and bring us more guests! I have no time to answer while watching him leave. I look around and see Nita and her husband: Do you speak German? I ask them. I am so touched. Nita holds my hand: You will always be with me and you will be my translator. My father was born in Kayseri, she bursts into tears. I am sorry, don't worry, I am all right. The buses leave Kayseri, the next stop is Malatya. June 8: On the way to Malatya Malatya is 220 miles from Kayseri. One of the travelers wants to know if someone will have any objection if we go to Van via Diyarbakyr instead of Mush. A 70-year-old lady stands up and tries to speak as loudly as she can with a trembling voice: No, it's impossible! My father was from Mush, it's the only reason while I decided to come. I will go on foot to Mush, if I have to! Exclamations! An Armenian church on the left side...but unfortunately not enough time to stop... The lahmajun shopkeepers and the apricot sellers can't believe their ears as they hear our friends speaking Turkish with a regional accent: They are not tourist! they exclaim. We are in Malatya. Two young boys working in the reception area of the hotel are talking with a 60-year-old woman who lives in Boston. Teyze sen nerelisin? (Where do you come from, aunt?) They learn that she was born in Marash. Is there anyone from Malatya in the group?' they ask and the conversation goes on. The president of the Industrialists and Businessmen Association of Malatya welcomes us at the restaurant where are to have dinner. Those who are from Malatya want to take a picture with the president. Before leaving, the president repeats that he wants all of us to come again to Malatya and stay longer. Tomorrow, we will leave at 8:00 a.m. The next stop is Arapkir. June 9: Morning We will leave Malatya after the religious service. The church was built in the 18th century. Someone raises the issue of renovation and makes a call to the Diaspora: We have to take the first step, let's collect some money among us. The services start. I am wondering when the last time was that so many people have gathered in this church, and the last time Gregorian chants have resonated. Everything is suddenly so intense that it becomes even difficult to breathe. I am wondering why I am so upset and I realize that many are about to burst into tears and others cannot even wait for the end of the services, the pain has just become unbearable. I realize that I have begun to share the pain: no need to understand, feelings seem enough...The children of the district are listening to the services carefully. We want to buy some refreshments. The shopkeeper, an old lady, says: My grandmother also belonged to them [Armenians]. There is a monastery on the road to Arapkir. After a 10-minute walk we reach the monastery, that we can hardly contemplate the nature. The monastery is falling into ruins. We are trying to pull pieces of the wreck from the front of the monastery, and to pick up the stones obstructing the entrance. OK, one last piece and we will have finished the restoration, one of us says. The bus makes a last stop near a hotel. The regional press is here. They are very much interested and they do their best to be helpful. We are told that there is an Armenian church and an old cemetery in the surroundings. June 9: Afternoon: Arapkir Our arrival is a real event in the daily life of the village. Lunch gives us a good opportunity to converse with the villagers. They seem very much interested in those of us fluent in Turkish. I realize that there are more and more people speaking Turkish in the group. The villagers would like to know if there is anyone from Arapkir. When we answer yes, there is, the elder ones seem very much moved. An old man remembers his youth, the time when the population of the village was half-Turkish and half-Armenian. He has tears in his eyes. A past, which is still alive. We wonder if anyone knows Abp. Khajag Barsamian, who was born in Arapkir in 1951. Everyone tries to identify the Barsamian family. Two Armenian families are still living in Arapkir, but there is no doubt that the most famous Armenian of Arapkir is Sarkis. Sarkis is 90 years old; he lives in a beautiful house. Sarkis and his friend Hovsep are so happy and excited when they see us! This excitement doesn't make him forget the basic rules of hospitality. He wants us to have lunch. No, Sarkis, we've just come to meet you, and, don't worry, no host could have entertained 80 guests, especially in case of a surprise visit! We are all in the garden. No barriers separate the past from the present anymore. Sarkis' neighbors come to meet us. I hear one of the three policemen in civilian clothes saying to Sarkis: It must be a happy day for you, Sarkis; look, you have so many guests! Raffi and I start talking with the neighbors. I realize for the first time how good Raffi's Turkish is. I am also from Arapkir. The last time I came here I was 17, it was for my sister's wedding, says Raffi. A few questions are enough to refresh the neighborhood relations...Everything proves to be so easy... Sarkis is singing with the group. Emotions keep growing and it becomes so hard to fight against tears. What is happening is really incredible! I agree with my friend. We say goodbye to Sarkis. I have the feeling that the whole population of Arapkir is waiting for us near the buses. You want all of you to come back, and stay longer. I am doing my best to answer the questions of the regional press and the children of the village, but the bus is leaving, I promise them that I will come again with the whole group, and I start running to catch the bus. June 9: Evening: Harput We are in Harput. There is nothing left from either the famous Protestant school of Harput, or from the old Armenian district. One of the two women we have been talking with says: I used to live in Elazig in an Armenian house; if you wish, we can go and see it. An old lady sitting in front of a house is crying. She explains in Turkish that she was born in Harput, her family left Harput and went to Aleppo when she was 10. She remembers every detail, the house which is behind us, the steep street on the left. The government said that the border was open, we left everything behind us, we didn't even take a dress, she adds. A 40-year-old man is picking up some soil. His father was from Harput, so he would like to put the soil on his father's grave. He reminds me of a man who was traveling with his godfather's ashes, to take them to Tokat, his godfather's birthplace. June 9: Evening: Elazig An academic from Fyrat University and the members of the Young Businessmen Association of Elazig are attending our dinner. The group starts singing Armenian songs. I am listening to the academic from Fyrat University speaking with the one who certainly knows Anatolia the best in our group. They are making a list of words with an Armenian etymology and that are used in the region. Tomorrow, we will be divided into two groups. One bus will go to Van via Mush and the other one via Diyarbakyr. There are people from Diyarbakyr and from Mush. TABDC will be with those going to Mush. June 10: Morning: Palu Upon the insistence of a few persons from Palu, the bus stops here for half an hour. There is a woman among us who is looking for her aunt. When her mother was 10, she became separated from her sister who remained in Palu. The villagers are very helpful. They take us to the place of an old lady. Unfortunately, she can't help us; she's just told us that her mother was Armenian, had been found in a garden and adopted by a Turkish family. We thank her and the bus leaves Palu. June 10: On the road to Mush A small group of 20 persons wants to go and see the old monastery located in a small village near Mush. Our minibus is surrounded by the children of the village. They are surprised when I tell them that I am Turkish. The monastery that they were expecting to see was one of the holiest places after Etchmiadzin, but there is nearly nothing left of it except a few remnants. We notice that a few stones from the monastery have been incorporated in some houses of the village, as building blocks. The beauty of the road between Bitlis and Van helps us forget our bitterness June 11: Van - Akdamar (Aghtamar) We plan to go to the island of Akdamar just after lunch. Three small boats are waiting for us. The weather is sunny, we are getting closer to the island. We are waiting impatiently for the moment when the Akdamar church will be visible. Finally! The captain of the boat tells us not to stand up to take pictures...It is the most impressive Armenian monument that I have ever seen. I am with the first group entering the church. Impossible to stay put! After the first shock, a long silence...Difficult to find the right words, too many emotions, impossible to utter the slightest words. I move slowly at a corner and watch those who are following us. No one can hide emotions, even the priest seems strained before the office. Candles are being lit by trembling hands. The religious service is over. No one wants to hurry up. Some people go for a walk around the island; others prefer to carefully examine every detail of the church. It's time to go back to the boat. On the way, many come to me and speak in a low voice, as if they would like to tell me some secret. I pick up the same words and expressions: I can't believe that I am here! I never thought I could come here one day! After having seen it for such a long time on posters, finally! I have studied Armenian history at school. I have been dreaming of Akdamar. I never thought I could have the opportunity to see it one day. We are living a miracle! It's part of our identity, that's why there are so many emotions, it's such a special day for us!... June 12: Morning: On the road to Kars We are about to leave Van to go to Kars via Dogubeyazyt and Igdyr. The hotel is on the Van lakeside. I see a woman with a bottle walking toward the lake. Barbara is a playwright. She has written a play about Lake Van, it is the first time she saw the lake, she will bring the bottle to her studio. Barbara didn't want to come to Turkey because she was totally indifferent to Turkey, the country just didn't exist for her. Her brother wanted her to come with him. The bus is leaving. We are getting closer to Dogubeyazyt. I know that Mt. Ararat is not very far away. It is sunny and we can easily see both of the peaks! Finally the buses stop and then a big rush...We are in a meadow. I have never been so close to Ararat before. I realize that some in the group are seeing Ararat for the first time; others are seeing it for the first time from this side. Those who live in Armenia are convinced that the side of the mountain that we are contemplating isn't that impressive. We cannot make up our minds and do not want to choose between the two sides. We are having lunch in a restaurant with a view of Ararat. We are just happy, eating and singing. There are songs that we usually sing at the table, explains a friend sitting next to me. For sure, the setting is just perfect! We are driving north. Armenia is a few miles away. We can see Yerevan. We are near Digor. Arpachay River separates us from Armenian villages. June 12: Evening: Kars A very special welcome at Kars! The mayor of Kars joins us for dinner. The regional and national media is also waiting for us at the hotel. The mayor has invited the Caucasus folk dancers of Kars. We realize that it's very hard to find any differences between Turkish and Armenian folk dancing. The mayor proposes to go and plant trees for brotherhood on the way to Ani. The proposal is immediately accepted. June 13: Morning: Ani The last day in Turkey. We have special permission: for the first time there will be an Armenian Airlines flight connection between Kars and Yerevan. Flying time 15-20 minutes! Arrival at Ani brings a huge disappointment! We won't be allowed to take any pictures and the religious service is also forbidden, because Ani is on the border in the military zone. TABDC tries to negotiate; communication with Ankara is very bad. And finally the long-awaited answer: we will be allowed to take a group picture and to hold church services in the cathedral! These services have become very meaningful even to me. They give life to old monuments, a kind of a new revival and every special moment and the emotions that we share that bind us. And the local population usually pays much attention to these services. After the ceremony, there is a gathering in front of the cathedral for a group picture. The picture is to be published in the daily newspaper, Milliyet, on the 14th of June. Back to the buses and last destination: Kars airport. June 13: Kars Airport The mayor of Kars and high representatives from the security department are at the airport. The four groups, after travelling around Anatolia, meet at the airport; it is a historical day for the small airport of Kars. Unfortunately TABDC won't go to Armenia with the group. We are on the take-off strip, near the plane. Difficult to keep cool. This event was definitely not a tourist trip, nor a traditional pilgrimage. We are all very well aware that the event has far-reaching implications: we have all been actors and missionaries. It took a certain amount of courage for all of us: our success is the result of this joint endeavor. We would like to show our gratitude especially to the Diocese of the Armenian Church. Our aim is, by contributing to the development of both Anatolia and Armenia, to raise awareness of the diversity of Anatolia, to help to acknowledge the existence of an Armenian past in Anatolia, and to send positive messages to Armenia, Turkey and to the Diaspora. We will encounter many hindrances. However, I will always remember the very last words of a friend, who had never accepted to talk with a Turk before this pilgrimage tour. He kisses me, says goodbye and adds: Only you, you can do something. We, we are too emotional!","Gultekin, Burcu",Armenian Reporter International,2001-07-14,0
"Jerusalem Journal: Au Revoir, Tristesse Departing From the Holy Land I left Jerusalem at the end of May and said goodbye to a land that enchanted me with its cities and villages, its stony upland soil and its fertile valleys, its hills and tels [ancient mounds], its living and dead seas. All of it has been written on scrolls for us to read and know and understand, and there is hardly any place too small to be mentioned in the massive history comprised of the books that make up the Hebrew Bible. These places have been destroyed and rebuilt so many times that an archeological dig will often find five or six layers from different eras, the last building on the rubble of the former and life beginning once again. There is a certain comfort in the fact that Jerusalem has risen from the ashes so many times after exile, after pillage and burning, after destruction by Persians, Greeks, Assyrians, Romans, Crusaders, Mamelukes and Ottomans - and now, its present inhabitants who are hell-bent on ruining one another. This is the land that, according to Christian belief, has seen the Incarnation - a bit of eternity which broke into time - so that the saving events of the life, passion, death, and resurrection of Jesus, called the Christ - would free us from affliction and from the power of death. His life was one of great moral beauty; his crucifixion was a revelation of God's judgment on sin. His resurrection and sending of the Spirit formed what he wanted us to be: a royal people, a priestly people, persons of infinite dignity, brothers and sisters in a close bond of love. He gave his body and his blood to be our nourishment so that we could live up to the inner dignity that he bought so dearly for us, his Church. Something strange happens to people when they come here, reflected by Oliver Goldsmith's line the fools who came to scoff, remained to pray. Many feel they have to return again. Some return to live and die here. I am one who would like to come back to revisit all the places I have seen: the City of Jerusalem now divided into Christian, Armenian, Muslim and Jewish quarters, each quarter marked by its own sounds, sights, and exotic smells from the souks (bazarres) that snake underneath the city, with shopkeepers begging for people to visit their wares. I would like to see again the wide-open, welcoming Galilee of the Nations, with its sea now called Kinneret, a Hebrew name from the Aramaic name it once had in the time of the Gospels. I like to think that Jesus and his companions from Galilee had the same openness to people that the landscape has for the sky. There is enough desert left for the soul in Judea, and there are still enough deserted places in the Galilee where one can be alone with God - where nothing distracts. One has to ask why the single holiest sites for Jews and Christians are only a few meters from each other. And why is the third most important site for the Muslims of the world sitting atop the holiest site of the Jews - with only one wall left to give voice to their bereavement of the Jewish people? Is Jerusalem the place where God allows people to make pieces of Him, as they did of the prophets and his Anointed One? Is it all this blood that makes it holy? I feel for the friends I've left behind in Jerusalem, some living with fear on the streets every day and others grinding out a living - afflicted people for whom even God must have great pity. And all I could think of was, Au Revoir, Tristesse.","MacPhaidin, Bartley",The Boston Irish Reporter,2001-06-30,0
"Prof. Bert Vaux of Harvard Speaks on Dialect of Muslim Armenians at NAASR The Armenian dialect of the Hamshen, a mostly Muslim and little-known group of Armenian origin living along the Black Sea in Turkey and Abkhazia in Georgia, was the topic of a lecture by Harvard University professor of linguistics Bert Vaux on June 7 at the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research Center here. Few people are aware of these people, who, in all, number several hundred thousand worldwide. The Armenian community is largely unaware of this group to whom they are related ethnically and whose language, called Homshetsma by its speakers, is closely related to standard Western Armenian. In his talk, Prof. Vaux focused on the Muslim or Eastern Hamshen or (Hemshinli) of Northeast Turkey. Vaux has done extensively fieldwork with Hamshen living in the United States, including the Boston area. ORIGINALLY FROM AYRARAT DISTRICT OF ARMENIA Explaining that the Hamshen derive their name from a village of the same name in Northeastern Turkey, near Rize, which seems to have been itself derived from an Armenian prince, Haman Amatuni, who came there with migrants from the Ayrarat district in the eighth century A.D., Vaux then proceeded to detail the striking similarities and noteworthy differences between the language Homshetsma and standard Armenian. Vaux, with Hagop Hachikian of Belmont, has developed a means of writing Homshetsma, using Turkish orthography (as opposed to the Armenian alphabet, which is unknown to the Muslim Hamshen). Drawing on the audience's knowledge of Armenian, he presented a number of Hamshen words, phrases, and eventually an Armenian folktale in Homshetsma. Audience members were able to identify certain words based on their similarity to their familiar Armenian or, in some cases, Turkish forms. PUZZLING RIDDLES AND UNFAMILIAR NAMES One of the more entertaining examples of Homshetsma language which Vaux presented was a series of perplexing riddles, which not only gave a sense of the language but also provided something of a window into the culture. The riddles, the answers to which seemed to bear only a passing relationship to the questions, are in fact, he explained, characteristic of the sometimes impenetrable (to the outsider) world of traditional Armenian riddle culture. One of the riddles, translated, goes I put a sieve full of egg on the roof. The answer is Star. Another window into the forces shaping the culture is provided by Hamshen personal names, which are mostly unfamiliar to Armenians. Their names do not generally have Armenian roots but rather are generally related to Turkish or Georgian names (which are languages unrelated to Armenian). Indeed, there is a strong South Caucasian Turkish aspect to Hamshen language and culture, which is a hardly surprising given their geographical location. CONVERSION TO ISLAM BUT SOME CHRISTIAN ELEMENTS REMAIN Vaux explained that while there were forced conversions of the Hamshen to Islam from the 16th century down to the 1915 Genocide, the language preserves the memory of the people's Christian past to an extent; for the most part, though, Christian elements noticeably have been purged. Yet, although the language has been mostly de-Christianized, the Hamshen still observe the Armenian Christian New Year (celebrated on the day of Epiphany), the Armenian Christian feast of Vartivar, and the language retains the Armenian Christian word for God, Asdvadz. In addition, down to the 20th century, it was reported that some Hamshen still performed baptisms. Vaux played an audiotape of one of his field research subjects telling a folktale called Temel's Head' in the Homshetsma dialect. Although the audience had difficulty following the spoken language, due to changes in pronunciation, the written version proved more recognizable. The story is actually a variant of a well-known satirical Armenian folktale called The Priest's Head - only stripped of its Christian elements. The folktale, then, stands in miniature for the larger relationship between Homshetsma and standard Armenian. QUESTION OF IDENTITY Vaux concluded by posing a question to the audience, which prompted a good deal of discussion: Are the Hamshen Armenians? Opinions from the audience varies; but this was perhaps to be expected, given that opinions vary even among Hamshen themselves. Some of them privately acknowledge their Armenian identity or roots, but publicly few will do so. Others consider themselves to be Turks or Laz. There are, it was pointed out, important political factors at play in Turkey which would discourage the Hamshen from openly professing their Armenian origins. One aspect of their identity which singles them out from other Armenians who have lived in Turkey is the fact that they were left largely unaffected by the Genocide. SCHOLAR OF ARMENIAN DIALECTS Prof. Vaux has done extensive research on the Armenian language, especially documentation, preservation, and analysis of nonstandard dialects, including that of the Hemshinli. He is the author of The Phonology of Armenian, a major study of Armenian linguistics published by Oxford University Press. In addition to articles on Armenian linguistics an dialectology, he is the author of the forthcoming The Armenian Dialect of New Julfa and forthcoming textbooks of Eastern and Western Armenian. He also is the author of a chapter on the Hamshen language in the forthcoming book. The Hemshinli, edited by Hovnan Simonian, as well as a lengthy article on the subject in the forthcoming issue of NAASR's Journal of Armenian Studies.

"Anjar Armenians in Uneasy Conditions Over Land Dispute with Other Locals Anjar is an all-Armenian village in the Bekka Valley of Lebanon. It was established toward the end of the 1930's, by Armenians who were evacuated from the Alexandretta region of Hatay province when it was ceded to Turkey by the French, who held the mandate over Syria. The villagers built homes for themselves and subsequently developed the village into a prosperous area. At the present there is a rift over territorial ownership among Armenians and Lebanese Arabs who live around the village. This article explains the reasons for that rift. On a Saturday night last month, an unidentified gang stole into the orchards of the all-Armenian municipality of Anjar and cut down 350 fruit trees. The Internal Security Forces hastily rounded up an unidentified number of suspects, accusations were hurled against the neighboring town's mukhtar (village leader), and all suspects were eventually released for lack of evidence. According to the locals, the incident is the fourth or fifth to take place in recent years, and has fueled the complicated land dispute between local Armenian and Sunni communities. In the weeks that followed the incident, both communities resorted to political jockeying, vying for influence and a quick, extra-judicial solution. Both the deputy speaker and the education minister pledged support for the Bekaa Awqaf office's claim to over 5 million of Anjar's 18 million square meters. The Armenians, meanwhile, went straight to the prime minister and grand mufti, pleading for a quick and painless settlement. A schoolteacher from the neighboring town of Majdal Anjar, who identified himself only as one of those suspected, furiously pointed at his suit when asked about the vandalism and cited his degree in Arabic literature. Does it look like I would go into someone's backyard and cut their trees down? Me! Do you really think I'd do that? He then went on to recite a litany of grievances against the Armenians, including a tale of an Armenian who married a Muslim girl, and was later murdered or disappeared. They're terrible neighbors and don't let anyone live with them, he said. But most others (on both sides) were much more circumspect, denying any friction between the communities. We have never had any problems with our neighbors, said Sebouh Sekayan, Anjar's mayor. Our valley has been a model of peaceful coexistence for over 60 years. The whole issue is not that sensitive for us. There's no friction. We're afraid the issue will keep tourists away. Giragos Kiledjian, one of the 15 municipal council members, pointed to an old map in a gold-painted frame, hanging on the wall in Sekayan's office. People say that when you look at the town of Anjar from the mountain, it has the shape of an eagle, he beamed. And it is true. Any way you look at the town and its surrounding fields, especially from above, there is no denying that it is remarkable to look at. Houses are located equidistant along the gridded streets, and in the middle a two-lane avenue is crowned by a great, white church. No other town in the country looks like it, Kiledjian stated proudly (and indeed, there are few towns in the country that were designed and built from scratch by order of the French government). The story of Anjar (at least, as told by Sekayan and Kiledjian) is a tale of a victimized and heroic people, displaced from land that the French were handing to the Turks. The French government, the story goes, set them up on desert-like land ironically, the name Anjar derives from the word for water source where there was nothing but weeds, insects and malarial mosquitoes. We made this and planted every single tree, Kiledjian said, wincing as if at the memory of the wild land of his youth. In 1939, the mandate government paid 410,000 French Francs to purchase two estates from a man named Rashid Beyk; then in 1947, well over half of the town's population returned to Armenia to help obtain statehood under the Soviet system. In 1963, the government here redistributed the lands of those who had left to the remaining residents. However, Sekayan and Kiledjian maintained that the deeds proving exclusive Armenian property rights are in a real estate office in Zahle, and that only 240 individuals failed to produce deeds for their lands, meaning that only around 500,000 square meters could be disputed. Responding to the rhetoric of the Muslim community, most notably recent public statements by the mufti of Mount Lebanon, Mohammed Ali Jouzou, Kiledjian complained: We've lived here peacefully for 60 years. We Armenians are not guests, as they are calling us, we're citizens. This, of course, is the Armenian version of events. If you drive to the neighboring, mostly Sunni town of Majdal Anjar on the foothills of the Anti-Lebanon range and look back at Anjar, one thing is striking: the municipality of Anjar is greener than the land around it. This may be, in part, the result of an active and organized community spread neatly over divided land, making an effort to cultivate fields and plant trees. Another reason may be that the municipality sits on two springs: Ain Anjar and Shamsin. Sekayan and Kiledjian did not deny that Majdal Anjar and the surrounding villages (nearly all of which are populated by Sunnis) have no water sources of their own. Half of the water of Shamsin goes to the state, feeding around 50 villages, all the way to Rashaya, Kiledjian said. Sheikh Mohammed Abdel-Rahman and Sheikh Assem Jarrah, president and secretary respectively of the Bekaa Awqaf office, claim that everything about the establishment of Anjar's founding is illegal. Abdel-Rahman said that, according to an agreement signed at Lausanne by the League of Nations, the French Mandate did not have the authority to buy, sell or transfer land. Abdel-Rahman and Jarrah argue that the land could not be bought or sold in the first place, as it is the site of an ancient religious endowment, or waqf. Proof of the endowment, they said, could be found at the Zahiriyya Library and the Center for Historical Documents in Damascus, as well as the archive center in Istanbul. It has been a waqf for 400 years. It was cultivated, and the boundaries were defined, Abdel-Rahman said, alleging further that Rashid Beyk was not the rightful owner of the lands, but merely an administrator. He said Rashid Beyk tried to take advantage of the chaotic state of affairs in the aftermath of the 1925 Arab revolt and register the land in his name. However, according to Abdel-Rahman, a judge in Zahle refused to certify the transaction. Show us the contract and the deeds and we will believe them, he challenged. Abdel-Rahman and Jarrah also countered that what the Armenians refer to as a decree redistributing government-owned land to the remaining residents was never actually passed. The government stated its desire to issue the decree, but never went through with it. The two men dispute the 1947 date, claiming that most of the Armenians who arrived in 1939 left before spending five years as tenants on the land. According to land laws, they said, this would mean the property should automatically revert back to the state. We have the registry book showing that no one has ever paid rent for using that land, Abdel-Rahman said of the state-owned land within Anjar. Indeed, right in the middle of Anjar lies the historical monument for which the town is famous: the eighth-century city founded by the Umayyad Caliph Walid I. From the ruins you can see a small mound, or tel, also within the municipality. On the top sits a maqam, or shrine to the pre-Islamic prophet, Uzair. Local Muslims say they have performed an annual religious ritual at the shrine for hundreds of years, a custom, they said, only interrupted during the war. Most people in both communities say the friction between the two communities began some four or five years ago, with the beginning of renovations of the shrine. Jarrah said that every step of the renovation has been contested by the municipality, which often called in the police to stop works. If we want to plant so much as a flower, the police show up, said Jarrah, complaining that they are called by the municipality or the (Tashnag) party. Abdel-Rahman and Jarrah repeatedly stated that they had no problem with the Armenian community in Anjar. Our problem is with the state. Moreover, authorities in both camps say they'd will abide by whatever the state decides, which may explain why MPs and religious authorities for each side have recently rallied to mobilize support, in the hope, perhaps, or avoiding a court case. But brotherly love only goes so far. The Bekaa Awqaf disavowed any responsibility for vandalizing the orchards last month, proffering that the Armenians had cut down their own trees in order to blame their neighbors. Abdel-Rahman and Jarrah also said the Tashnag Party played a major role in Anjar, administrating land, making revenues off water, and being the biggest instigator of problems, as Abdel-Rahman put it. He said the springs provided the municipality and the party with upward of LL3 billion in annual water fees. A Tashnag party spokesman however, roundly denied the accusations. Last year people were saying that we were taking money from the families of Anjar to buy weapons in order to fund a war against Muslims in the Caucasus, he chuckled. Simply not true.","Gomez, Rivas",Armenian Reporter International,2001-06-09,0
"Jerusalem Journal: The Harsh and Holy Land On Palm Sunday, I was among the small community of expatriates, Arab Christians and visiting pilgrims, who followed the path from Bethphage to Jerusalem, celebrating the event that began the final week in the life of Jesus. It was not a happy event on this Palm Sunday and neither was it for Jesus on the first Palm Sunday. Maybe it is good for us to know this. Before Jesus began the same journey, he sent two disciples into the nearest village and asked them to bring a colt of a donkey they would find tethered in the street. It was unbroken, never having been ridden by anyone. When the disciples returned with the foal, the people gathered there put their cloaks on the colt's back and made the Master mount. Then began the procession into Jerusalem. The people pulled olive branches from the trees, as well as tufts of grass from the fields, placing them in front of the donkey's feet. They sang songs of triumph that they already knew from the Temple liturgies. The children took up the chant of Hoshi - anna, which means Save now, and waved branches as they began the journey down the slope of the Mount of Olives. When Jesus came in sight of the City, tears welled up in his eyes. He said, If only you had known this day, the way that leads to peace. But no; it is hidden from your sight - Mk. 20:4 It was a mock-regal and prophetic entrance into Jerusalem, indicating the kind of Kingdom of justice and peace that He would bring into the world. Those who welcomed him to the City as the Son of David (read Messiah) did not understand that in the least, nor could they imagine the price that would have to be, and has to be, paid for a society of justice and peace - not to mention love. Jesus could not quite explain it to the crowds, because after three years his disciples did not even understand it. Even after the Resurrection, they were still entertaining the thought that he would restore the earthly kingdom of David. Only the coming of the Spirit made it clear to them that the Messiah was the Suffering Servant spoken of in the Hebrew (Old) Testament, and not a triumphant King. Yesterday was Passover Day and Palm Sunday. Next Sunday is Easter. As we pass from the colorful and poignant scene from the Gospel, we have to face the hard and painful realities of the present day in Jerusalem. There is no panacea, no instant solution, no happy ending in sight. As we trudged in the footsteps of Jesus on Palm Sunday, it would have been easy to imagine the same scene, the same tears, the same words, If only this day, you recognized the way that leads to peace. But no; it is hidden from your sight. It would be as true today as it was then - even truer, because peace this time around will be infinitely more complex, and all who love this Holy Land are involved in its fate. But the hour of its visitation is here again, and again the way to peace seems to be hidden. Fighting, rioting, bombs and bullets have been followed by death and by inevitably emotional and painful burials. Every time an innocent dies, we hear the same laments. In our cities and towns, the Palestinians say, we are hemmed in like prisoners. There are checkpoints everywhere and we are not allowed to pass, not even to visit our relatives in the adjacent villages. The economy is in ruins, and thousands have no work. If the troops humiliate them, how can we prevent our young from throwing stones and firebombs. In the violence, you must notice that the majority of the dead are Palestinians. The Israelis respond: We want to live in security, but how can we when your snipers shoot from innocent-looking houses in the suburbs, your bus drivers mow people down in the street, your terrorists carry explosives strapped to their bodies and immolate themselves in crowded malls or bus stations, so as to destroy as many Israeli lives as possible. Our people in the settlements want to live in peace, but when their fury is aroused, it is we, the Israeli army, that have to protect you from them. We have heard the arguments before. Both Israelis and Palestinians want peace. Their leaders, however, have drawn lines in the sand and wait for friendly nations to broker new talks. For the present, there are no takers, and there is an omnipresent sense of powerlessness. So we have experienced an uneasy Passover, much like the first Passover in Egypt. An Easter of dismay and disappointment, much like the first Easter followed. The Muslim penitential month of Ramadan reduced the tension and violence. Passover week has been fairly peaceful. The shooting began again on Easter Sunday evening. But more is needed than religious truces. They are only inspired lulls in the conflict. What is needed is Justice, a hard task-mistress to satisfy. At then end of our journey, walking up to the city through Stephen's Gate, we gathered in a courtyard off the Via Dolorosa, in the ample and lovely courtyard of St. Anne's. Michel Sabbah, The Patriarch of the Latins, as the Bishop of Jerusalem is called, gave a brief address, and it included the following blunt words: Justice should prevail, rights should be recognized. And no one should dominate the others. All of us should be equal contributing to the creation of a new society. There is no escape and no way out from the right way. Still many will die, many will be wounded, many will be humiliated. But in the long run, there is no escape from the right and just solution. At the end of his talk, the Patriarch talked of his hope for peace, as well he should. But he did not jump to that topic. Instead, the hard message came first. He knows as well as we do that, even as we read, the young Arabs at the check-points are piling up stones and gathering Coke bottles for Molotov cocktails for after the feast days. The last week has been as fierce as anything we have seen. We can see the artillery and missiles, red in the dark, as they cross the valley in front of the Ecumenical Institute, where I live. The point in all of this is stalemate and no hope in sight. The international community has a huge religious, cultural, and economic investment in these areas. There are individuals with creative ideas, but it will take a long time if these are to be funded and nurtured. End of story. It is not a happy story, and I would delude my readers if I even indicated that it was. For many, it is what Simone Weil called a pulverized existence. Pray for the peace of Jerusalem, also a symbol in our faith for heavenly Home.","MacPhaidin, Bartley",The Boston Irish Reporter,2001-05-31,0
"JOHN PAUL II CONTINUES ORTHODOX OVERTURE. Pope John Paul II received assurances from the Greek Orthodox Church's Holy Synod that it will not oppose the pope's long-desired visit to sites connected with St. Paul's mission. The pope will visit Greece in early May during his trip to Malta and Syria, other Pauline pilgrimage sites. Some Greek priests and monks plan to protest the visit citing what they consider the long history of Vaticansponsored aggression and violence against Orthodox Christians. The pope hopes that his visit will be a first step toward healing the Great Schism which split Christianity between Roman Catholic and Orthodox branches nearly 1,000 years ago. During his trip to Syria, the pope will also visit a mosque which houses the tomb of John the Baptist. John the Baptist is revered by Muslims as a great prophet. The pope is expected to meet Muslim religious leaders, but they will not pray with him in the mosque. Pope John Paul II has discussed the return of the miraculous icon of Our Lady of Kazan, which is currently housed in the Vatican apartments. It appeared mysteriously in Kazan in the Russian Federation's Republic of Tatarstan in 1597 but was stolen from the Kazan cathedral in 1904. The pope assured local public officials that he has no objection to the return of the icon but said the exchange could take place only between religious leaders, since it is a religious treasure and religion is a question of piety and not politics. Thus it would have to be received by Patriarch Aleksei II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church, who has opposed papal hopes for a visit to Russia.","Fiore, Benjamin","Polish American Journal, National ed.",2001-05-31,0
"Reading Between the Lines The OSCE Minsk Group Co-chairs are an unusual match, in particular the US and Russia. On the surface, both are giving the impression of cooperation but, in essence, they both are pursuing different goals and objectives. When they declare that the conflict resolution depends on the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, they both have a different understanding thereof. Russia's aim is the prolongation of the conflict while, for the U.S., the objective is a rapid conclusion of the peace treaty, which serves their national interests well. Since both Moscow and Washington have different leverages and the ability to influence the outcome of many international disputes, claiming that the final peace agreement in the Karabagh conflict is up to the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan may not reflect the reality. Due to their precarious economic and weak political situation, these small countries depend on Russia and the U.S. for economic assistance and political support. MANY FACTORS INVOLVED Needless to say, the geopolitics, trade and commercial interests and, most important of all, the exploitation of black oil and natural gas resources and the desire to control energy and oil pipeline transportation routes, are playing major roles in the resolution of the Karabagh conflict, which will be determined based on the relations among the US, Russia and, to a lesser degree and indirectly, among Turkey, Iran, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and the Central Asian countries of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. One may detect differing degrees of motivation, intention, policy goals and objectives from the statements of the mediators, the head of the negotiation teams, highest officials of each of the interested parties. By doing so, one may gain the impression that the resolution of the Karabagh conflict is far from finalization, and there is a long way to go yet to achieve permanent peace. The issue is complex, pinning two internationally accepted norms and concepts - self-determination versus territorial integrity - against one other. Furthermore, as mentioned above, various national and global interests are in a conflict over geopolitical dominance and are competing to control energy resources, and oil and natural gas transportation routes. Taking into consideration historical trends and the prevailing mutual suspicions among the various states in the region, as well as the historical rivalry between the U.S. and Russia, the situation becomes even more complex. In particular, weak Russia feels threatened by its large Muslim Turkic populace within its boundary. War in Chechnya and the presence of other potential conflict regions in the Russian Caucasus and along the belt of Muslim Turkic-inhabited regions dotting Russia's soft southern belly are making Moscow very nervous, considering it is already suspicious of the intentions of Ankara and Washington. Threatened by a resurgence of Islam and nationalist upsurge within the boundaries of the Russian Federation, losing all of its military bases in Georgia and Azerbaijan (except the Garbala early radar warning base in Azerbaijan), and being engaged in a protracted war in Chechnya financed by the Saudis and Turks, Moscow cannot afford to lose its last Caucasian bases in Armenia. Russia believes that, with the final conclusion of the Karabagh conflict, its leverage on both Armenia and Azerbaijan will be drastically reduced. ARMENIA PLAYS PIVOTAL ROLE In the same context, Washington realizes that once Armenian reconciles with neighboring Azerbaijan and Turkey, Moscow's presence in the Caucasus will become irrelevant. A high-profile Armenia investors forum meeting was held in New York recently, which was encouraged by the U.S. and sponsored by the World Bank, International Finance Corp., the U.S. Trade and Development Agencies. Russian press coverage of Armenian issues and frequent Russian official visits to Yerevan reveal that Armenia plays a pivotal role in regional affairs, and is courted by both Washington and Moscow, thanks to its geopolitical location. After this brief introduction, it is imperative to review the recent statements by various officials in Washington, Moscow, Ankara, Yerevan, Tbilisi, Baku, Tehran, an the Central Asian capitals. Carey Cavanaugh, the US special mediator, stated: The headway reached during the Paris and Florida talks allowed them to intensify their work. He continued: Serious concessions should be made and brave moves taken for reaching peace in the region. This means that more concessions are needed from the conflicting parties in order to achieve permanent peace, which means that there are numerous serious unresolved issues preventing a final agreement. Russian co-chair Nikolai Gribkov was more blunt when he recommended not to get lost in illusions that the problem will find its solution soon. The Russian mediator continued: Karabagh is a major independent factor; no stable or real settlement can be achieved without taking its interests into account or, worse still, disregarding these interests. He also stated: Karabagh is a serious party in the conflict. This means that Russia is not yet convinced that reaching an agreement now will serve well Moscow's interests. Highlighting the thorny issue of Karabagh's direct participation in the peace process, he is reminding the other interested parties not to be unduly enthusiastic yet. Mr. Gribkov further stated: The problem's radical solution depends on the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia. ALIYEV'S POSITION The shrewd Azeri President Aliyev's answer was revealing; You always say the problem's solution depends on the two presidents. I have no objections to that, but the problem would have found its solution if it depended on us solely. This means that he geopolitics and national interests of Russia and the U.S. are the main factors that are preventing finalization of the agreement, since the power plays of both Moscow and Washington are marginalizing the national interests of Armenian and Azerbaijan. Aliyev, being a seasoned politician, realizes that without finding a common language between Washington and Moscow, the Azeris and Armenians can not conclude a peace agreement alone, since both the Azeri and Armenian presidents are getting conflicting messages and even instructions from the superpowers, and are therefore unable to come to a final agreement. One of the most striking statements came from the Commander in Chief of the Russian Air Force, General Anatoly Komukov, when he was answering questions asked by Azerbaijani TV station ANS on May 14. He stated: This conflict should be settled only in a peaceful way, because up to now war has caused only troubles. When he was asked whether the Karabagh air defense units were included in the recent Armenian-Russian war games in Armenia, his answer was: These were just regular exercises. This decision was made just to maintained equipment in a normal state, because military equipment works better if it is used. This means that the integration of Karabagh into the Russian-Armenian defense structure is normal to maintain regional stability. DEFENSE MINISTERS DIFFER On May 14, Ambassador Carey Cavanaugh, while crossing the Azeri-Karabagh border, stated: Our hope is that as peace approaches, these roads will be opened for international assistance, it is important we've got both countries ready for peace. This means that if you want economic prosperity, which will require U.S. investment, the parties to the conflict have to come to terms with the idea that you are not going to prosper if you persist in your version of the peace agreement. On May 18, during the CIS Defense Ministers Council meeting, when Azeri Defense Minister General Safar Abiyev requested that Armenia, being a terrorist state, be excluded from the Defense Council, his Russian counterpart, Defense Minister Sergei Ivanov, shrugged off the suggestion and dismissed the idea as not being a very serious option. Russian Security Council Secretary Vladimir Rushaylo was more elaborate in his answer when he stated: I consider it expedient to treat the events in Nagorno Karabagh as international terrorism. According to Russian policymakers, Turkey will benefit the most if Armenia is forced to yield in the Meghri issue and grant Azeris access to Nakhichevan. The Russians are convinced this will open the doors to Turkey, and Ankara will utilize this access, which will give Turkey a strategic advantage and ability to penetrate the Central Asian Turkic regions. This is why the Russians are using delay tactics to prolong the peace negotiations until the Turkish factor is eliminated. It is striking that Russian Defense Ministry official, General Leonid Ivashov, stated that NATO and, in particular the U.S. embassy in Yerevan, are trying to drive a wedge between Armenia and Russia and attempting to destroy military cooperation between the two countries. Tehran is also unequivocally against the Meghri project and declared it to be in Iran's interests to develop the Meghri district economically. It also made it clear that Iran is against changing international boundaries. Iran, being the home of 20 million Azeri-speaking inhabitants, is traditionally and historically wary of Pan-Turkism, and so is supporting Armenia and Karabagh in their quest to maintain their territorial integrity and independence. Turkey's State Minister Abdullah Cay, during his speech at the American Turkish Assembly Convention in New York this past weekend, said it all when he Stressed: The Baku-Ceyhan pipeline is a political rather than an economic one, for the sake of the economic independence of the regional countries. Pan-Turkist Cay lamented: Turkey had not seen the support expected from the Central Asian countries on the Cyprus and Nagorno-Karabagh disputes. He elaborated further, saying: The Central Asian countries are leaving us alone on these two issues in order to stay unbiased.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-05-26,0
"An Awe-Inspiring Pilgrimage to Turkey This past April, fifteen of us undertook a pilgrimage to holy Armenian sites in Turkey. Our parents described their towns and homes in Historic Armenia and elsewhere in Turkey with great nostalgia. We wanted a piece of their dreams. We wanted a piece of their dreams. We wanted to see, touch and feel. We were eager to visit their birthplaces and find out what is left. They told us about fear, suffering and escape. We wanted to visualize their predicament and retrace some of their steps. They described where they were baptized, where they prayed for divine comfort, where they went to school. We wanted to prayed on any vestige of their churches. They told us about the Ottomans, about injustice, cruelty, persecution and genocide. We know about post-Ottoman violations of Armenian rights, falsifications of history, and efforts to eradicate all traces of past Armenian life in Turkey. We were curious: why was Turkey as of late letting Armenians visit their historical lands? Was this a turnabout? Was this a trend to encourage? Our parents told us also about Turks and Kurds who saved Armenian lives. We wanted to reach out to the inherent goodness in the citizens of Turkey. We wanted to take the pulse of everyday individuals not connected to anti-Armenian, anti-genocide government propaganda. We wanted to gauge reactions to our reappearance in Turkey, eighty-five years after. We wondered, how would we react towards them? Many have Armenian grandparents in Turkey - mostly grandmothers. Would any come forward? What does Armenian ancestry mean for a Turk or a Kurd? We wanted to meditate and pray for a better future for mankind. GREAT GUIDANCE, SAFE TRIP Our guide was Armen Aroyan. His encyclopedic knowledge of the region and its history is fueled by 30 journeys deep into Anatolia. He has a compass-like flair for interesting details, which he highlights a most unassuming manner. His team is perfect, always rising to challenges - and there are challenges. Driver Jamal Kokmen is an ace at the wheel, and his superb people skills make him endearing to everybody. Official government-approved guide Aghavni (Annie) Tashjian knows all the ropes, and she wiggles out of bureaucratic and police/military hassles adroitly. She is extremely pleasant, and she goes to all lengths to accommodate. THINGS TO FEEL SAD ABOUT Our experience was a mixture of discovery, sadness, awe, joy, and hope. It was absolutely meaningful. The absence of any Armenian life in Anatolia is striking, especially in towns where Armenians used to be the majority. We found no Armenians in Van. In other places, there are just a few, here and there. For Easter service in the only operational (Syriac) church of Kharpert, there were two handfuls of Armenians. Some of them had come from neighboring cities. The old city of Van is completely outlines. The new Van, where the Aikestan of the Vanetsis was located, is a modern city. In other towns, most Armenian homes are gone or reduced to rubble. One beautiful Armenian home in Yozgat is restored into a museum (not related to Armenian life). Making it even harder to detect any previous Armenian presence, names of localities have been systematically changed - to break ties with the past. Kharpert is Elazig; Antep is Gaziantep; Antioch is Hatay. Armenian treasures are never presented as Armenian. Bagradounis and Artsrounis are presented as if they came from another planet. Ani is officially spelled without the dot on the i. In Turkish, it is pronounced Aneh - which means memory. Most churches are empty shells in ruins, often without a roof. In remote areas they are used as stables. Some are preserved, and a few are renovated for tourism. A precious few are still functional. (According to Turkish law, there must be at least 14 members living around the church before the church is allowed to function). Some churches are now mosques, their origin systematically blurred with defacement. It is, of course, not possible to efface style, and inscriptions often survive because they look like decoration to the untrained eye. Many churches are in total ruin, and the majority have vanished - they only tell-tale evidence being khatchkars and inscribed stones incorporated into surrounding structures. One bridge in Marash is constructed with stones from one of the six Apostolic churches of the city. Before you get too upset, make note of the fact that the stones of the cathedral in Aghtamar previously belonged to an Arab castle 100 km away. Some sites conjure haunting images. Hazar Gölü is a pretty peaceful lake today, but in 1915, thousands were drowned in the middle of the lake. Igdir was a station on the escape route from Van where terrible massacres took place. A little west of Ani, there is a memorial for the Turkish victims of Armenian massacres. We stood aghast, scratched our heads and wondered. PEOPLE TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT Everywhere, we met fine human beings who received us in a friendly manner. In remote places, villagers watched us as we wept and prayed among ruined, vestigial churches. They helped us find what we were looking for. They knew we were Armenian, and they never displayed any animosity. Once of twice, local officials did not know how to relate to us, but they quickly came to the fold after a few phone calls. Clearly, instructions from higher-ups were to make everything easy for us. We even had police escort and an ambulance when we went to remote Kurdish villages judged potentially troublesome. Nevertheless, we never witnessed trouble anywhere. One group member's relative popped up in Antep. She had studied in America and spoke fluent English. Her Armenian maternal grandmother eloped with her Turkish grandfather in 1907. The grandmother's family completely ostracized her, even threatening to harm her - so the grandmother stayed in hiding for many years. The family tried to make up as they were fleeing in 1915, but her heart was irremediably broken. The grandmother was a quiet, devout Muslim and she died 35 years ago. Said the relative: When I was an exchange student in America, my dear Armenian friend often told me I had the facial features of an Armenian. We used to laugh. Imaging my surprise when I returned home and found out that I was really part-Armenian. I was seventeen then, and my grandmother had already passed away. She invited us to her home and had us meet her family. They seemed fascinated by their Armenian ancestry. Very, very nice people, with longstanding credentials in the community. We looked at pictures and explored feelings. We did not know what to feel, and we are still in the process of digesting the find. PLACES THAT MOVE YOUR SPIRIT We went to Istanbul, Kars, Ani, Kaghizman, Igdir, Dogubayazit, Van, Aghtamar, Nareg, Bitlis, Mush, Diyarbakir, Arapkir, Kharpert, Malatya, Gurun, Kayseri, Yozgat, Marash, Antep, Antioch, Vakif and Dort Yol. We saw the awesome fortress of Ani and her extraordinary churches. We saw the Urartian fortress of Van. We went to Surp Khatch Cathedral on Aghtamar. We saw the remains of Varagavank by Mount Varag near Van, and Surp Garabed by Mush. We visited the site where St. Gregory baptized King Dertad - on the Aradzani River, by Diyadin. In Palu, we saw the very fortress where St. Mesrob Mashdots created the Armenian alphabet, according to tradition. We visited former American missionary institutions in Antep and Marash. We went to Hromgla, near Cilicia, where ten catholicoi - including Nerses the Gracious - occupied the seat of the Armenian Church for close to 140 years. Across from Musa Lehr (the mountain of Musa Dagh), we had prayers in a fully functional church, with the only Armenian priest outside of Istanbul, in the only (almost) fully Armenian town of Vakf. We saw King Levon's castle in Cilicia - and much more. THE ARMENIANS OF BOLIS (ISTANBUL) Almost all the 60,000 Armenians of Turkey are in or around Istanbul - an extraordinary city by its own right. There is active Armenian life, but Armenians have to be low-key. Many churches are functional, most are renovated or in the process of restoration. They are beautiful. We attended bits of Badarak in different churches over two Sundays. We went to a choral concert with a symphony orchestra made up of...non-Armenian, Turkish citizens. We heard songs that said: My Hayastan, My Ararat, My Artsakh and other nationalistic themes - all government-approved. We visited the extraordinary Surp Pergich Hospital and old people's home. We even went by infamous Bank Ottoman! We met the Patriarch of Bolis on Palm Sunday and saw him in action for the door-opening ritual. He met with us for an evening snack. He is charismatic and brilliant, and he has tons of fortitude. We were charmed, and he gave a lot of information. DON'T MISS THE PILGRIMAGE SPONSORED BY THE DIOCESE! We are in awe. We are fascinated. History is much easier to grasp in the proper geographic context. The beauty of the landscape makes the whole thing even more worthwhile. We come back to our homes and friends enriched, invigorated and cautiously hopeful for the future. The diatribes of anti-genocide propaganda are not immediately palpable, and it is possible to relate to the citizens of Turkey at a personal level, in a rewarding way, and without fear. We felt safe, remembering that we felt safe, remembering that we are not second-class citizens of any Ottoman state and that no one can really harm us. You should sign up for the June 4-18 pilgrimage to the Armenian sites or Turkey organized by the Eastern Diocese. You will cross into the Republic of Armenia, all the way to Yerevan and Etchmiadzin. If the pilgrimage to Jerusalem last year is any measure, this is likely to be a class act. Don't miss the golden opportunity. Get in touch with 2,500 years of continuous Armenian history in Anatolia and modern Turkey. Your act of presence may be the only effective way to assure the survival - let alone perpetuate the significance - of your heritage. You still have time.

"The Rev. Rousas John Rushdoony; Advocated Rule by Biblical Law The Rev. Rousas John Rushdoony, often called theologian to the religious right and an outspoken advocate of a nation ruled by biblical law, has died, He was 84. Rushdoony, a native of New York City and the son of Armenian immigrants, died Feb. 8 of prostate cancer in Vallecito, CA. A prolific author, Rushdoony's works included The Institutes of Biblical Law, a compilation of five years of his sermons from 1968 to 1972 that became the theological framework that his followers said underscored much of the Christian right's political activism. Rushdoony's writings are the source of many of the core ideas of the New-Christian Right, said his son-in-law, Gary North, a conservative political activist. Rushdoony believed in a return to a Christian civilization. He championed Christian home schooling. Indeed, supporters called him the father of the Christian home schools movement that began to take hold in the 1970s. As an unabashed Christian Reconstructionist, Rushdoony called for replacing civil law with biblical law - and an unalloyed Christian version at that. He believed that, because Christianity fully embodied God's law, it rightly should be the final arbiter of right and wrong. He thought biblical law should apply worldwide. Political action could help bring that about, he said. He believed that all faith results in actions and social consequences, his son, the Rev. Mark R. Rushdoony, said in an interview this week. We have a humanistic culture because humanists have been acting in terms of their beliefs. He believed, if Christians acted in terms of their beliefs. He believed, if Christians acted in terms of their beliefs, we would have a different culture. But a number of political conservatives disassociated themselves from Rushdoony's views, among them Ed Dobson and Ed Hindson of Liberty University, the fundamentalist Christian college in Lynchburg, VA, founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell. Writing in the conservative Heritage Foundation's Policy Review in 1986, Dobson and Hindson said Rushdoony wanted Christians to prepare to take over the world's government and its courts. Rushdoony distrusts democracy, they said. They noted that some of his followers called for laws mandating the death penalty for homosexuals and alcoholics. SOME DISTORT HIS VISION No doubt this is a frightening prospect for many secularists and members of the Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist faiths. But they are not alone, Dobson and Hindson wrote. It is a scary vision for he majority of evangelicals and fundamentalists as well, the two of us included. Rushdoony was approvingly quoted by racist fringe groups, according to Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, which tracks anti-Semitism worldwide. But, Cooper said, Rushdoony also disavowed such groups. In a 1986 interview with The Times, Rushdoony said the end of the nation-state was at hand. We are in the last days of humanistic statism, he said. Now people regard politicians, the state, lawyers - everyone associated with the state apparatus - with the same cynicism that people in 1500 regarded the Catholic Church (before the Protestant reformation). But Rushdoony insisted that he never sought to impose God's law by force. The change, he said, had to take place in the hearts of individuals. Heaving seen the light, he said they would prove their fidelity to God's law in all their actions. But his son said his father did not believe in a statist approach. He was not writing a political plan of action for a modern government. He believed in looking at the Bible first of all as God's requirement for us as individuals, he said. Rushdoony's single-minded appeal to God's Law meant there would be consequences for those who violated it. His critics said that if God's law were enforced as Rushdoony saw it, the death penalty would be imposed on offenses ranging from blasphemy and witchcraft to propagating false doctrine, adultery and homosexuality. That was not his intent, Mark Rushdoony said. He did not favor the killing of homosexuals by the modern state. He said we should understand (homosexuality) as being against God's law. Rushdoony graduated from UC Berkeley and the Pacific School of Religion, and was an ordained Presbyterian minister. Early in his life, he was a missionary to Shoshone and Paiute Indians on the Duck Valley Indian Reservation in northeastern Nevada before serving two churches in Santa Cruz, Calif. Besides his son, Mark, Rushdoony is survived by his brother, Haigh Rushdoony of Danville, Calif.; wife Dorothy Rushdoony; and four other children: Rebecca Rouse and Joanna Manesajian of Angels Camp, Calif., Martha Cole of Downey, Calif.., and Sharon North of Winslow, Ark. He also had 18 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Photo (Rev. Rushdoony, in 1996.)","Stammer, Larry B",Armenian Reporter International,2001-05-12,0
"86th Anniversary of April 24, 1915: A forger of history and one of the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide, the so-called Turkish historian Ahmet Esat Uras and his follower Justin McCarthy Ahmet Esat Uras is one of the founders and tacticians of the Armenian Genocide denial school. He is the author of the revisionist and fraudulent history book titled Armenian Question and Armenians in History (Tarihte Ermeniler ve Ermeni Meselesi), which was first published in Ankara in 1950, three years after Soviets put claims on Kars and Ardahan. Being one of the organizers and participants of the Armenian Genocide, he intentionally fabricated the mythical Armenian uprising and Muslim-Armenian inter-communal civil war theory. In order to back up his allegations - 1) He tries to discredit the sources and evidence of the Armenian Genocide eyewitness accounts, documents, and publications, labeling relevant testimony and materials as anti-Turkish ploys or fabrications. 2) He withholds, falsifies or forges materials and evidence implicating the highest echelons of the Ottoman government. He presents false documents stating that Talat Pasha gave directives to secure the safety and security of the Armenian deportees, and hypocritically claims that those guilty of committing excesses against the Armenians were punished. 3) Shifting the blame on the victims in order to vindicate the perpetrators, he invents the Armenian uprising story and crafts the so-called Muslim-Armenian interethnic and inter-communal warfare theory in order to explain Armenian Causalities and deaths. 4) In order to give credibility to his fraudulent accounts and story, he displays in his book pictures of the Armenians possessing guns and ammunition. Uras knowingly uses these deceitful pictures, even though he is aware that the Ottoman Interior Ministry Propaganda Department officers had orders, prior to sending Armenian deportees to the killing fields, to take their pictures in front of the government's own arms and ammunitions stockpiles, in order to use these pictures as evidence in the future to frame the Armenians with arms possession. 5) In order to minimize the total number of the Armenian civilian deaths, he intentionally reduces the total number of the Armenian population living in the Ottoman Empire prior 1915 from 3.5 to 1.2 million. In order to over-inflate the number of Turkish death, which occurred in four different war theaters as the result of direct combat action against the Entente Powers during WWI, he attempts to link the Muslim causalities to a fictitious civil war, intentionally uses the term Muslim deaths and counted casualties among the Arabs, Kurds, Circassians, Laz, Bosnians, and Albanians as Turkish losses, which had also occurred in war theaters. He fraudulently attributes Muslim casualties to have been the direct result of interethnic and inter-communal confrontation between Armenians and Muslims, which is pure fabrication. 6) In order to shift the blame, he accuses the foreign powers, namely Imperial Russia, Britain, and France, of meddling in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire and using the Armenian factor to promote their imperialistic ambitions vis-à-vis the Ottoman Turkish Empire. In order to distract critics from pointing to the Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist ideology as the cause of the demise of the Armenians in 1915-1923, he falsely blames the Armenians for intending to establish a Greater Armenia with foreign help. MINIMIZES ARMENIAN HISTORY In his book, Uras, in order to minimize Armenian history and presence, denies any link between Hays and Armenia. He believes Armenia is a geographical term used by the Greeks and Persians, later adopted by the Romans to describe the mountainous region of Eastern Anatolia, and that the name has nothing to do with Armenians, since they call themselves Hays. Uras believes that the newcomer Hays who inhabited this geographical region adopted the name of the region, and foreigners also began to call them Armenians. Later, in order to preempt Armenian demands, he asserts that Armenians never had statehood; therefore Armenians cannot lay legal claims on Eastern Anatolia since they were always subject to the Persians, Romans, Byzantines, and Arabs. In a final argument, he emphasizes that Seljuk Turks seized Anatolia from the Byzantines, not from the Armenians, conveniently forgetting that at the gates of Ani, citizens of Armenia were put up fierce resistance against the invading Seljuk Turks. It is striking that contemporary Azeri historians are also having identical arguments. Since Uras's book first appeared in 1950, every Turkish historian, including foreign Turkish apologist historians like Justin McCarthy and Andrew Mango, have quoted this forger, word by word, sentence by sentenced and paragraph by paragraph. All Armenian-related publications in Turkey written by members of the Turkish Historical Society repeat, like parrots, the above-mentioned Uras's reasoning, rationalization and justification of the Armenian deportations and casualties. Ahmet Esat Uras was born in Amasya in 1882 and died in Ankara on January 11, 1957. He was a graduate of the Political Science Faculty (Mektebi Mulkiyei Sahane). He was multilingual and fluently spoke French, English, Arabic, Persian, Greek and Armenian. According to the distinguished Genocide scholar Professor Vahakn Dadrian (See Holocaust and Genocide Studies; Vol. 7, No. 2, Fall 1993, pp 173-201), Ahmet Esat was the wartime head of the Ottoman Interior Ministry's Department II, Intelligence, which was under the jurisdiction of the office of Public Security (Emniyeti Umumiye). Prof. Dadrian states that Esat Uras had, in his possession, documents in his own handwriting - The Ten Commandments, as Dadrian calls them, revealing the roles of the Ottoman military, the gendarmeries, and the calculated incitement of the masses on religious and nationalistic grounds which were central to the planning and implementation of the genocide. URAS'S TEN COMMANDMENTS According to Prof. Dadrian, The Ten Commandments included: 1) Close all Armenian societies, and arrest all who worked against the government at any time among them and send them into the provinces such as Baghdad or Mosul, and wipe them out either on the road or there. 2) Collect arms. 3) Excite Moslem opinion by suitable and special means, in such places as Van. Erzurum, Adana, where, as a point of fact, the Armenians have already won the hatred of the Moslems; provoke organized Massacres, as the Russians did at Baku. 4) Leave all executive to the people in provinces such as Erzurum, Van, Mamuret ul Aziz, and Bitlis, and use military disciplinary forces ostensibly to stop massacres, while on the contrary, in places like Adana, Sivas, Bursa, Izmit and Izmir actively help the Moslems with military force. 5) Apply measures to exterminate all males under 50, priests and teachers, leave girls and children to be Islamized. 6) Carry away the families of all who succeed in escaping and apply measures to cut them off from all connections with their native places. 7) On the grounds that Armenian officials may be spies, expel and drive them out absolutely from every government department or post. 8) Kill off in an appropriate manner all Armenians in the Army - this to be left to the military to do. 9) All actions to begin everywhere simultaneously, and thus leave no time for preparation of defensive measures. 10) Pay attention to the strictly confidential nature of these instructions, which may not go beyond two or three persons. SAGA OF ESAT URAS According to Prof. Dadrian, there were five participants when The Ten Commandments draft agreement plan to dislocate, deport and destroy the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire was adapted: Talat, Dr. Nazim, Behaeddin Sakir, Ismail Canbolat and Colonel Seyfi. Among those perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide, what was the official status of Ahmet Esat Uras and what was his culpability in the Armenian Genocide? Again, according to Prof. Dadrian, Esat Uras was a deputy to Ismail Canbolat, one of the actual organizers of the mass murders and head of the Public Security in the Interior Ministry. Esat Uras was called as the Chief of Department II of the Interior Ministry at the time when German journalist Von Tyszka interviewed him with the permission of Ismail Canbolat (See Dadrian in Holocaust and Genocide Studies: Vol. 7, No. 2, Fall 1993 p 176.) After the conclusion of World War I and the ensuing Turkish War of Independence in 1920 (Turk-Istiklal Harbi), Esat Uras, one of the organizers and participants of the Armenian Genocide, was called to duty by the Nationalist Provisional Government in Ankara and was assigned to the position of Security Directorate (Emniyet Muduru). After the conclusion of the Independence War, he took part in the Lausanne peace conference. After the establishment of the Turkish Republic, he was elected to the Turkish Medjilis as representative from Amasya. This is the saga of Ahmet Esat Uras, who later authored many books, two of which dealt with Armenian history and the Armenians. Thus, this erstwhile murderer become the chronicler of his victims; in order to exonerate himself from the judgment of history, he forged, falsified, and lied through his teeth. URAS'S PARROT FOLLOWER: JUSTIN MC CARTHY When one reads Justin McCarthy's article, Let historians decide on the so-called genocide, published in the Turkish Daily News on April 10, 2001, one cannot help but feel pity for this man who keeps repeating the same lines from Uras's fraudulent accounts, denials, falsifications and justifications. There is nothing original about Mr. McCarthy's version of history published in TDN; he repeats exactly what Esat Uras wanted the entire Turkish nation and world to believe that there were no premeditated, perplexed Ottoman government orders for the deportation and killing of the Armenians. It was a wartime response of a dying empire, for self-defense purposes, against internal enemies, Armenians, who were agitated by the foreign powers. Yet Justin McCarthy goes even further than Uras. 1) He believes that the famous Ottoman Court-Martial against the so-called perpetrators of the Armenian deportation and atrocities was a ploy by Ferit Pasha (Damat Ferit Pasha was the husband of Sultan Abdulmecit I's daughter. He was a professional diplomat, member of the Chamber of Notables and Grand Vezir - M.A.). According to McCarthy, Ferit Pasha, who created the courts to curry favor with the Allies. McCarthy continues: The courts returned verdicts of guilty for all sorts of improbable offenses, of which killing of Armenians was only one. He adds: The courts chose anything, true or false, that could cast aspersion on *** enemies. The accused could not represent themselves. Can the verdicts of such courts be trusted? McCarthy fails to mention that the Ottoman Court Martial only sentenced to death those who could implicate the higher echelons of the Ottoman government, but the main perpetrators Talat, Enver, and Djemal Pashas were allowed to escape. He also fails to mention that Mustafa Kemal Ataturk blamed those Ittihadists for having Armenian blood on their hands. 2) He invokes that the British didn't have sufficient evidence against those Ottoman high officials exiled to Malta and therefore the British couldn't have indicted or sentenced them. He again conveniently forgets that the British, in order to obtain the release of their prisoners of war from Turkish jails, cut their own deal with the Nationalist Turks in Ankara and released the Ottoman detainees. 3) He asserts that the eyewitness accounts and testimonies of foreign missionaries are not credible and accuses them of lying. 4) He tries to discredit Ambassador Henry Morgenthau by invoking Admiral Bristol's statement, but he misquotes Admiral intentionally and conveniently forgets that Allen Dulles (brother of late CIA director John Foster Dulles), a young State Department employee who not only targeted a secret war against the Jews but also was trying to cover up the Armenian Genocide, actually worked for an extreme bigot, Mark Bristol, who wished to advance American interests in the Mosul oil fields in Iraq, which were then controlled by the Ottomans. Bristol described the Armenians as a race like Jews - they have little or no national spirit and poor moral character. (See pp 201-202 in The Secret War Against the Jews, co-authored by John Loftus and Mark Aarons.) Justin McCarthy, quoting Admiral Mark Bristol, expresses his bigotry and hatred against Armenians. 5) Mr. McCarthy also attacks the British for releasing the Blue Book written by Viscount James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee and calls British accounts of Armenian atrocities wartime propaganda. He accuses British as well as American missionaries of publishing a number of scurrilous works in which Ottoman officials were falsely quoted as ordering hideous deeds. Apparently Mr. McCarthy is more impressed with the accounts of forger and murderer Ahmet Esat Uras when he repeats, like a parrot, the latter's lies and fabrications before his death in 1957. 6) Justin McCarthy castigates those for quoting Hitler's remark, Who, after all, still speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians? He believes Hitler never said such words, his reference is another Turkish apologist Health Lowry. It appears that Justin McCarthy never bothered to visit the Holocaust Museum in Washington, DC even once; otherwise he wouldn't dare question the integrity of the Holocaust Museum founders who had ample evidence to confirm the authenticity of Hitler's statement, which is imprinted on marble, occupying one of the walls of the Holocaust Museum, even though they were shamefully forced to deny space for the Armenian Genocide victims under Turkish pressure. 7) Mr. McCarthy defends other revisionist historians, like Heath Lowry, Bernard Lewis and Stanford J. Shaw, without uttering a single word about the 126 Holocaust Scholars' Affirmation last year, regarding the incontestable fact of the Armenian Genocide. Obviously it is not easy to convince the bigots, apologists, ignorant and falsifiers but the times are changing rapidly. Turkish human-rights activists Dr. Bulent Peker and Akin Birdel, Prof. Halil Berktay, Prof. Mete Tuncay, Koray Caliskan, Yunus Tencel, Taner Akcam and many others have already broken the silence; for them, the Armenian genocide issue is no longer a taboo but a reality that the Turkish people have to learn to deal with. Those deniers, forgers, and falsifiers of history are the only remaining obstacles on the road toward reconciliation.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-04-21,0
"The Minor and Major Issues Concerning the Assessment of Emerging Larger State of Affairs - What can we expect from the Key West summit Under the shadow of the recent cooling of relations between the US and Russia, and the US-Chinese spy incident, some progress was reported at the end of last weekend's summit in Key West between Presidents Robert Kocharian of Armenia and Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan. The White House had announced that US President George W. Bush would meet in Washington with the Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan. A new comprehensive proposal to resolve the conflict will now be elaborated by the mediators ahead of another meeting between the two sides scheduled for June in Geneva. After Azerbaijan's rejection of the Package Solution and Common State proposals and Armenia's rejection of the Step-by-Step approach, the mediators have now introduced the Proximity Talks variant to break the impasse. According to recent information, in Geneva, the conflicting parties will stay in different rooms before the meeting, and the mediators will conduct shuttle diplomacy with each President until the gap is further narrowed prior to a final face-to-face meeting. There is also a new concept: Iran will be also informed about the proceedings, which makes one wonder if the issue of the corridor between Armenia and Azerbaijan, through the southern district of Meghri, is still on the agenda. RECENT CHILL NOT A FACTOR It was feared that the recent chill between Washington and Moscow, created by the tit-for-tat spy explosions, the largest since the Cold War, might have its repercussions in sunny Florida but apparently this chill didn't prevent American-Russian cooperation. In Key West not only the national interests of the two Caucasian states but the national security and economic interest of the US and Russia and other states (Turkey and Iran) also played a role, as manifested by the suggestion that Iran also will be informed about the proceedings. Logic stipulates that major power involvement goes beyond mediation and peacekeeping desires; it is solely determined by commercial incentives to exploit the Caspian oil and natural gas deposits, and geopolitics to control the oil pipeline routes. On the surface, they are all talking about a need for mutual compromise and regional peace and stability but, in essence, the US and Russia, in particular, are trying to influence the talks in terms of their national interests and objectives. Although mediators in public are stating that they are not applying any pressure and leaving it to the conflicting parties to reach a mutually agreeable compromise, yet, in reality, they are pressuring them to accommodate. The US aims to gain control over energy resources and transportation routes, while denying Russia and Iran direct control over this important geopolitical area. The US is also trying to secure most favorable commercial conditions for the oil companies. On the other hand, Russia is complicating matters further by manipulating Armenia and Azerbaijan during bilateral talks and misleading them, using doublespeak, like stating that Russia is for territorial integrity of all states and also for the security of the disputed territory's population. With conflicting statements, Russia is trying to prolong the Karabagh dispute to justify their presence in the Caucasus. CONFLICTING PARTIES' AGENDAS The conflict in parties themselves are also conducting their own agendas, while talking to mediators privately; they are also trying to use Turkish, Russian, American, NATO and Iranian cards in order to influence the negotiations. Yet there are unbridgeable differences between the conflicting parties over the interpretation or definition of the principles of self-determination and rights for independence versus territorial integrity, or to grant the disputed territory autonomy or variant form of political status within the concept of a common state, which blends the principles of de facto independence and inviolability of borders together. We all know that similar political solutions in the Balkans and former Yugoslav Federation created more permanent instability and enmity than reconciliation. This is why there is need to convene another meeting, now under the variant of Proximity Talk, as mentioned above. The Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan also need time to prepare their respective constituents and public opinion for the compromises that they agreed to make in Key West. It would be useful to analyze the positions of the participating mediators, conflicting parties and non-participating other regional powers, like Turkey and Iran. The interests of the host country, the US, favor de facto independence for Karabagh under Azerbaijani sovereignty. The US wants to resolve this conflict as soon as possible in order to go ahead with the Trans-Caspian and Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline projects, which will integrate the economies of the Caspian and Caucasian states with Turkey and indirectly with West, and will neutralize Russian and Iranian influence in the region, creating more favorable geopolitical and commercial circumstances for the U.S. Washington is promising multibillions of dollars of investments as a carrot but also warning that any failure to compromise may have dire consequence for the region; namely, if the conflicting parties undermine the US position, they will pay an unspecified price, like withholding financial aid or investments. PROLONGED CONFLICT IN RUSSIA'S INTEREST Russia wants the conflict to continue for the time being until Moscow can consolidate its geopolitical presence in the region. Russia is aware that once peace is concluded, Moscow will lose its leverage over both Yerevan and Baku yet, on the other hand, if the conflict drags on, both Armenia and Azerbaijan will continue to court Russia for favor and will force them to give concessions to Moscow to keep Russian bases in the Caucasus (Gumri base in Armenia and Gabala radar station in Azerbaijan). Some Armenian opposition groups are criticizing President Robert Kocharian for conducting a complementary foreign policy rather than pursuing a pro-Moscow line, thus alienating Russia and pushing it to court Azerbaijan. Ilkam Aliyev, son of Azeri strongman President Aliyev, in turn, is suggesting that final negotiations should be staged in Moscow, since Russia has the most crucial leverages to bring parties to a final peaceful agreement. While supplying military hardware and nuclear fuel to Yerevan and concluding multilevel interstate agreements, Moscow made it clear that they are in Armenia to protect CIS borders against Turkey and Iran, not against other CIS member states, namely Azerbaijan. During his state visit to Azerbaijan. During his state visit to Azerbaijan, Russian President Putin declared that the Russian Federation is for territorial integrity of every state but also is against the resolution of conflicts through military means, and advocates a continuation of the negotiations. Russia is determined to oppose any pipeline projects that will bypass its territory. Russia wants to maintain its commercial and political influence in Central Asia and the Caucasus; it is transferring its sophisticated arsenal to Iran, regional rival state to Turkey, and is helping Iran to develop its nuclear energy and strong defense. Moscow is trying to create a strong Iran against the rising Turkish power and influence, which Russia perceives to be a threat to its national interests. RECENT TURKISH MOVIES Recent Turkish moves in Georgia, such as the modernization of the airport in Azeri-inhabited Marneuli district and obtaining rights from Tbilisi to use the airport for refueling its military and civilian planes, are significant; they are steps toward permitting Turkey to have his airbase in Caucasus, which is a direct challenge to Russia and a danger to Armenia. Azeri Minister of Defense General Safar Abiyev is also calling for the creation of Turkish or NATO bases on Azeri territory, creating fear in Moscow that Turks and NATO forces are penetrating what is perceived to be their sphere of influence, exposing Russia's soft underbelly in the Muslim-inhabited frontier extending from Chechnya, Karachai Cherkessia to Bashkortostan and Tataristan. Amid all these conflicting national interests, Azerbaijani and Armenian positions on most of the crucial issues still remain non-reconcilable. Azerbaijan wants to reinstate its full sovereignty over Karabagh and only reluctantly agrees to grant an autonomy (similar to under the Soviet rule, when the Nagorno Karabagh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic - NKASSR - was an autonomous entity within Azerbaijan). Furthermore, Azeris should return to Shushi, and Karabagh should remain an enclave within Azerbaijan. In order to implement this, Baku is also demanding that Armenian forces should withdraw from Kelbajar and Latchin. Azerbaijan still considers the Karabagh Armenians as Azeri citizens subject to Azeri law (recent charges of terrorism against writer and activist Zori Balayan and placing him on Interpol's wanted list reveal how Azerbaijanis would like to exercise their rights over Karabagh). Azeri militarists in Baku are encouraged by the recent visit of Turkish Army Chief of Staff and Turkish Defense minister, who is now calling for a military solution to the Karabagh conflict, and is indicating that they will not accept or honor any agreement that fails to mention Azeri sovereignty over Karabagh. Furthermore, Azeri nationalists are now claiming that Armenia's southern district of Zankezur and even Yerevan were once inhabited by Azeris and should be returned to Azerbaijan. This kind of absurd Azeri-Turkish mentality prevents the Armenian side from taking a risk and signing any agreement with the Aliyev regime, which seems to lack the support of mainstream Azeri opposition forces. MALICIOUS AZERI CLAIMS The Azerbaijani leadership, just prior to the Key West talks, was also disseminating malicious propaganda that Armenian committed genocide against Azerbaijanis and forcibly deported more than two million of them from their native lands between 1915 and the present. In order to relieve their Turkish cousins from Armenian Genocide charges, the Azeris were also fabricating imaginary Armenian atrocities against Azerbaijanis and trying to poison the atmosphere of goodwill prior to the Key West summit. Yerevan's understanding of the peace settlement is just the opposite of Baku's interpretation, Armenia rules out any subordination of Karabagh to Azerbaijan Armenia rejects the enclave status for Karabagh, wants to maintain the Latchin corridor connection with Armenia proper and rejects the return of Shushi to exclusive Azeri control. Armenia believes that the people of Karabagh have the right to self-determination and eventual independence or unification with Armenia. Armenia believes that the introduction of the Meghri corridor issue in the Karabagh negotiations is not relevant and that one Armenian territory cannot be considered an arbitrator or mediator during negotiations since Turkey is forging a military alliance with Azerbaijan and maintaining a hostile disposition against Armenia by staging a blockade, and not establishing diplomatic relations unless certain preconditions are met, which include the rejection of genocide, financial compensation and territorial claims against Turkey or Azerbaijan. Armenia is not only looking for international guarantees if an agreement is signed, it also wants to be sure that, in the post-Aliyev era, Azerbaijani governments or future leadership will honor a signed agreement. Taking into consideration the participants' conflicting interests, one may conclude: 1) The US has vast interests in developing new oil and gas resources and has diversified its supply sources due to strategic considerations. The prospects for the Caspian Basin becoming a new source of energy in the coming decades are making Washington determined to prevent new conflicts in the Caucasus and resolve old ones. The US also wants to contain the influence of Russia and Iran in the region; in order to realize this agenda, Washington wants to integrate the economies and eventually the political alignments of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan with the other regional power Turkey (yet Turkey's power is in decline because of the recent severe financial crisis and collapse of its economy). In order for these objectives to be accomplished, the elimination of the thorny Karabagh and Armenian Genocide issues is considered to be a necessity. In order to implement this plan, Washington has promised to invest billions to rescue the ailing economies of the three Caucasian states. For this, Washington stipulates that the conclusion of the Karabagh peace agreement shouldn't be delayed. 2) Russia has its own manifest desire to see that the Key West talks will not finalize a peace agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan at this moment. Moscow wants to be the final stage for the conclusion of any peace agreement yet had to settle for the next meeting to be held in Geneva. However, for this, they want to be sure that Russia will play the role of guarantor and will send its peace-makers to the region. Prior to formalizing any agreement, Moscow also wants to be sure that Baku will grant political, economic and military concessions to Russia. Moscow is concerned that once an agreement is signed, Russia will lose all of its leverages in the Caucasus. CONSIDERATIONS FOR KOCHARIAN 3) Although an ardent supporter of the cause of his native land, Karabagh, President Robert Kocharian was under tremendous pressure in Key West to wrap up an agreement. If he makes dangerous concessions, and if he repeats the same mistakes of his predecessor Levon Ter-Petrossian by implicitly agreeing to de facto Karabagh independence within Azerbaijan and recognizing Azeri sovereignty over the disputed territory, he will be facing opposition in Armenia and the Diaspora as well. Yerkrapahs, ARF constituents, Ramgavars, the former ANM movement followers, and even Communists, as well as Diasporan supporters of the Karabagh movement, all will turn against Kocharian if he gives up at the negotiating table the rights and liberty of the Karabaghis which were gained by blood and sweat on the fields of fierce battles. He has to prove to his nation that he got a far superior deal than LTP; otherwise, people will question his motivation when he aligned himself with the late Vazgen Sarkisian to overthrow President Ter-Petrossian in the velvet revolution, which later also claimed the lives of Vazgen Sarkisian and Karen Demirchian with foreign complicity, which needs to be proven yet. If president Kocharian signs any deceitful agreements that will be against the national interests of Karabagh's Armenians, Stepanakert will certainly reject these faulty agreement. 4) President Heydar Aliyev is frail and ill. He was reportedly asking for Russia's help and US understanding to install his son Ilkam Aliyev as Azerbaijan's next president. It is not coincidental that young Ilkam Aliyev, in his last interview, suggested that Russia should be the arbitrator for Armenian-Azeri peace agreements, acknowledging what he calls Russia's legitimate interests in the region. Father and son, Aliyevs, know well that Moscow may have many puppets willing to serve Russia's interests in the post-Aliyev era. Aliyev also knows that any direct confrontation between Ankara and Moscow will create more complications for Azerbaijan. The Azeri opposition is already blaming Aliyev for selling out, in return, it is promising not to abide by any peace agreements, if Armenia doesn't recognize Azeri sovereignty over Karabagh. In conclusion, it can be assumed that, unless some magic happens at the next Geneva meeting, peace will be not be finalized since the differences among he conflicting parties over how to implement self-determination, territorial integrity or Common State proposals simultaneously, remain at the core of the dispute. Armenians worldwide should show their opposition to any bad agreement that may burden the incoming generation, thus creating a milieu for future conflicts. The final agreement should include self-determination rights and de-facto independence for Karabagh within its national secure borders or attached to Armenia proper with an internationally guaranteed connection, determined by newly created facts on the ground, namely the retention of the swatch of land between Kelbajar and Latchin. Karabagh should retain its armed forces, select its own parliament and President, and should be able to maintain its foreign relations and representations. Karabagh's future relations with Azerbaijan should be determined by direct negotiations between Karabagh and Azerbaijan, as equal partners, and any form of implicit subordination or consideration of political status within Azerbaijan should be rejected. President Kocharian should realize that he would not have what is mandated if he violates those principles. He blundered when he gave his interview to Turkish CNN correspondent Ali Birand, and his erroneous statements are still vivid in our memory, compelling us to remind him that he cannot afford to repeat the same mistakes and make sweeping concessions in Geneva (if he didn't already do so in Key West). In the Karabagh issue there is unity among Armenians that Armenian lands are not subject to negotiations ever.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-04-14,0
"Catholicos Aram I, Patriarchs Shenouda III and Zakka I Meet in Cairo A two-day meeting was held March 15-17 among Patriarch Shenouda III, the religious leader of the Coptic Church, Patriarch Zakka I, the religious leader of the Assyrian Church and His Holiness Aram I, Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, in the Patriarchate of the Coptic Church in Cairo. The current meeting is the forth one between the three spiritual heads. In 1996, through the initiative of His Holiness Aram I, the bases of an ecumenical structure among the Coptic, the Assyrian, and the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia were laid. The aim of this structure was to establish cooperation on the different issues and aspects related to the life and the mission of the church. The three spiritual heads had already met in Antelias in 1996, in Cairo in 1998, in Damascus in 1999 and again in Antelias in 2000. In order to give an organized and permanent structure to the ecumenical cooperation, they appointed a permanent committee that consists of two representatives of each church. Bishop Sebouh Sarkissian and the V. Rev. Fr. Nareg Alemezian are the representatives of the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia. The full committee had a two-day meeting in Cairo, which was followed by the meeting of the three spiritual heads. Following the meeting, they held a joint press conference, during which, after reestablishing their previous decisions and directives, the three leaders acknowledged with joy the 1700 anniversary of the proclamation of Christianity as the official religion of Armenia, by declaring that Patriarch Shenouda and Patriarch Zakka will participate personally in the celebration taking place at the end of May in Antelias. In the context of the theological dialogues with other churches, the spiritual heads welcomed the declaration of Archbishop Canterbury, to give official status to the dialogue that has existed for years between the Anglican Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches. They also verified the participation of their representatives in that dialogue. V. Rev. Fr. Nareg Alemezian was chosen the representative of the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia. Concerning the theological dialogue with the Catholic Church, in spite of their agreement in principle, the spiritual leaders decided to spend more time in reflection. The three heads also accepted with pleasure the suggestion of the Patriarch of the Russian Church to establish ecumenical cooperation between the latter and the Assyrian Church, the Coptic Church, and the Armenian Church through the Catholicate of the Great House of Cilicia. On this occasion, one of the subjects of discussion was the dialogue that has begun among all of the Orthodox Churches and the World Council of Churches, whose aim is to encourage greater participation of the Orthodox Churches in the life and the activity of World council of Churches. Also, a series of issues related to Middle Eastern churches was broadly discussed. The spiritual heads formed three subcommittees related to theological seminaries, youth, and publications, and chose the executive officers for these subcommittees. The officers assigned for the issues related to the youth are V. Rev. Fr. Nareg Alemezian and Rev. Fr. Mashdotz Chobanian. The three spiritual heads underscored the present situation of the Middle East in their joint press conference. In this light, they stressed the permanent and constant necessity of peace based on justice in the region. They condemned the injustices committed against the people of Palestine, and they stressed their right to a free homeland with Jerusalem as its capital. The spiritual heads also made an appeal to the concerned parties to stop the punishment of Iraq and to start humanitarian aid to its people. By emphasizing the fact that the Middle East is the birthplace of Christianity, the spiritual heads beseeched Christians to stay in the region, and to bring their full and active participation in the progress of their respective countries. They also stressed the need to further develop Christian-Muslim dialogue. At the end of the joint press conference, the three spiritual heads reaffirmed their willingness to continue their cooperation toward the continued strengthening of the Christian presence in the Middle East. During his short visit to Cairo, His Holiness Aram I visited the Armenian Embassy and had a meeting with the Ambassador, in the presence of the Prelate of Egypt, Archbishop Zaven Chinchinian. Bishop Sebouh Sarkissian accompanied His Holiness to this meeting. Afterwards, His Holiness participated in a banquet organized by His Grace the Prelate and national authorities.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2001-03-31,0
"PERSPECTIVES: Destruction in Afghanistan; turmoil in Ukraine Like many others, I've been preoccupied by the political turmoil in Ukraine sparked by the murder of journalist Heorhii Gongadze, but I've also been following another story: the Taliban's destruction of two immense Buddha statues carved into a cliff in Afghanistan. One of them was 175 feet tall and believed to be the tallest in the world. The other, at 120 feet, was almost as imposing. Carved more than 1,500 years ago, these two monuments were considered among the world's greatest religious and cultural treasures. The Taliban, though, viewed them as un-Islamic idols and ordered their demolition. People throughout the world, including many Muslims, were outraged. These are not idols, one Muslim intellectual said, but statues from the third century. Despite appeals from all corners of the world, the Taliban went ahead and with dynamite, tanks, rockets and picks, smashed the two statues. This isn't the first time, of course, that fanatics of one kind or another destroyed an irreplaceable cultural monument. Spanish Conquistadors tore down Aztec and Mayan temples and used the stones to build churches. Chinese Communist leader Mao Tse-Tung sanctioned the destruction of more than 6,000 Tibetan monasteries and, as recently as 1991, Serbian gunboats shelled Dubrovnik, a lovely Croatian city on the Adriatic known mainly for its libraries, monasteries and oceanside cafes. Learning of the destruction of the Buddhist statues, I couldn't help but think of similar vandalism in Ukraine. An utterly heartbreaking book, The Lost Architecture of Kiev by Titus D. Hewryk, lists nearly 50 churches, monasteries, fountains and cemeteries that were demolished during Stalin's rule in the 1930s. Tragically, this was a common practice in Soviet Union. Churches in nearly every community were destroyed. So were libraries: in 1964 under Khrushchev, a Communist Party activist burned down the Ukrainian Section of the State Library of the Academy of Sciences, including the archives of the Ukrainian Central Rada from 1918. The damage this kind of barbarism causes is incalculable. A 1989 poster from Kyiv depicts a stone wall: each stone is inscribed with the image of one of Ukraine's historic churches, but the wall has several gaps. Each is labeled with the name of a church the Soviets destroyed. A caption reads, Losing the Past, you lose the Future. Take away enough stones, the poster implies, and the wall collapses. The Soviets attacked Ukrainian history and culture as bourgeois nationalist. Hence the wholesale destruction of visible images that linked people with their past. Stalin was motivated by Taliban-like fanaticism; his successors by the inertia of evil and the compulsion to stay in power. In many ways, the struggle of the dissidents in the 1960s and 1970s involved the right to maintain Memory, to speak the Truth - both capitalized. One of the principal rallying points for the struggle was Oles Honchar's 1968 novel The Cathedral, where a student in a gritty steel town leads a successful fight against Communist bureaucrats to save an ancient church. The book was banned and its author denounced, but the message resounded. Honchar's cathedral symbolized something valuable that transcended the arbitrary power of the party and the state. Today, thousands of people in Ukraine - a high proportion of them youth - are demonstrating against Leonid Kuchma. President Kuchma, to be sure, is no Stalin or Khrushchev. He's not even a Boris Yeltsin or Vladimir Putin. He never ordered tanks to fire on his parliamentary enemies like Boris Yeltsin did in 1994 and he hasn't obliterated a provincial capital like Vladimir Putin did in Chechnya. Still, people are in the streets. Why? For three generations the Soviet state owned all the property and controlled every aspect of society. It had the power to destroy whatever it wanted, even thousand-year-old churches. Truth was whatever the Communist Party said it was. Anyone who thought otherwise was punished, even killed. Not surprisingly, many Ukrainians lost their moral compass and any sense of initiative. And, having lost a good part of their past, they lost the sense of where they were going as a nation. Nothing lasts forever, though, including evil, and if they didn't know where they were going in 1991, Ukrainians at least knew where they didn't want to be - and that was in the Soviet Union. Offered the choice, more than 90 percent of Ukrainians voted for independence. The elite that assumed power, however, consisted almost entirely of Communists who had shed their party label but continued to conduct business as if nothing much had changed. Instead of taking the nation in a new direction, they kept the old bureaucratic structures. Far too often, they solicited privileges and bribes, and helped themselves to the country's resources. Voices demanding government reform, openness and honesty were routinely ignored. And, ultimately, those who exposed corruption and wrongdoing were killed. At least that's what happened to Mr. Gongadze. His murder last year was the event that broke the dam. Now, 10 years after independence, anger is boiling over. President Kuchma's opponents have been playing audio-tapes that appear to implicate him in the crime. Mr. Kuchma claims the tapes are phony, part of a conspiracy to destabilize the country. For many, though, that no longer matters. Mr. Kuchma was in charge, and, instead of seeing a leader who lined up with those who long for progress and change, they see someone who protected special interests that look to maintain the past. The destruction of the Buddha statues in Afghanistan is a reminder of where Ukraine was just a couple of generations ago. That era, when the government could destroy religious monuments and people's lives with impunity, left a trauma that is taking Ukrainians decades to overcome. Its vestiges still poison Ukrainian society. The present turmoil is distressing, but ultimately it will turn out to be but a symptom of a more profound historical process. Government force will not resolve the issues. Instead, far deeper forces than the power of vested things will be decisive. With the all the pain and effort we associate with birth, a new political mentality is emerging, one that holds a few things sacred: 1,000 year-old churches, a journalist's right to report the truth, the people's right to assemble, a politician's oath of office. Weep for Afghanistan's loss. Have faith in Ukraine's recovery.","Fedynsky, Andrew",Ukrainian Weekly,2001-03-25,0
"What Armenia and Karabagh Can Expect from the Globalization Policy of the US and Its Allies Nowadays, everyone openly talks about the globalization of the economy and its impact on the nations throughout the world. Armenia and Karabagh, being two of the globalized republics, have become affected by its inflicting presence. The shocking fact is that the influence of globalization is not only limited to the economy, which is already being controlled de facto by the Big Brothers (USA, Europe and Japan) through their hand-out loans, but its domination is much broader and, alarmingly, succeeding in controlling the mentality and morality of these financially dependent nations. None of these countries, without exception, could escape from this dreadful influence. The infrastructure of these nations is in a state of rapid change. A survey of the current public mentality of the people in Armenia, who once were proud of their national heritage, and who were ready to fight and die for their country, shows that they are now becoming indifferent toward their national interests. Even the leaders of this country, by their daily actions, seem, first and foremost, more interested in their own well being than in caring for the people who entrusted them with great expectations. YOUNGER GENERATION DEMORALIZED It is amazing to see how globalization of the economy has succeeded by indirectly demoralizing Armenia's younger generation. This new generation is disillusioned by their country's failing economy, with no work and no foreseeable future. They are gradually losing-faith in their leaders, country and nation. Today, their meaning of life seems to life in dreams of leaving their Motherland, leaving behind all that once was the inspiring reason to enjoy the life of their national heritage. In order to avoid their military obligation, the young people, with the help of their parents, are bribing the military authorities in most cases, escaping from the country or enrolling in the university. The feeling of national patriotism is disappearing among the old and new generations. On our annual visits to Armenia and Karabagh, my wife and I have witnessed the gradual decline of the younger generation's interest in their national literature, art and entertainment by replacing them with movies of modern Tarzans, like Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Indiana Jones and others. They have fully switched to the American and British rap music, even though most of them do not even understand words of the songs. One can find such dreadful movies even in the remote villages of Armenia and Karabagh. Anyone who walks the streets of Yerevan, passes by outdoor cafes, or goes to restaurants, can see that foreign songs and music are dominant: Disco clubs are increasing. Casinos with foreign tastes and entertainment are mushrooming. The demand for foreign music and songs is growing rapidly, while the demand for Armenian entertainment is declining. Discs and tapes of Armenian music and songs are purchased mostly by Armenian tourists longing for the tradition Armenian entertainment. The dominance of the growing American and British entertainment over the Armenian national entertainment is a painful fact that affects the younger generation's mentality, causing the lessening of ties to their Armenian cultural heritage and love for their Motherland. LIFE-SAVING AID Because of the blockade of Armenia by Azerbaijan and Turkey (which we believe is supported by the U.S. and Europe, since it has not been condemned by them), there is lack of work in Armenia. The government, under the rule of democracy, cannot stop its people from making a mass exodus, searching for work in other countries to support their families back home. In spite of the present government's effort to seek financial support to rebuild the country's run-down industry, it received discouraging signals from the financially controlling countries, Instead, these countries are still continuing to flood Armenia with life-saving food aid. The US has always considered Armenia as belonging to an unfriendly Russian camp, and therefore would rather see Armenia under Turkish control. The US is least interested in Armenia's prosperity, in spite of its financial aid, since its aim in this region is to weaken this tiny Christian country by deliberately fostering conditions causing the people's exodus and its moral instability, and deterring this country's national unity. For the US-Turkey alliance, establishing a grip on, and control of, the Caucasus, Armenia and Karabagh are considered an eyesore. The United States' main ambitious plan, with the help of Turkey, after conquering the Caucasus, is to extend their control further to the Muslim countries of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, by extending their influence as far as the Chinese border, thus threatening Iran, Afghanistan and even China and preventing Russia from having any access to Central Asia. Taking advantage of Armenia's difficult economic conditions, the US is attracting the young Armenian scientists to these shore. For Armenia, this is another genocide, a bloodless form of brain genocide. The successful encouragement of Armenia's brain drain by the United States has now dangerously weakened Armenia's once-famous scientific community. The American University of Armenia directly participates in this exodus. Its contribution, if any, to help the country's welfare is insignificant compared to the harm it is causing Armenia. WEAKENING OF NATIONAL RELIGIOUS SENTIMENT The penetration of the international religions into the former Soviet republics is also in the interests of the Big Powers, since it aims to weaken the influence of powerful national religious sentiment in these countries. They tried to do the same with Azerbaijan and other Muslim countries but failed. For the same reason, it is in their interest to see that the Armenian Apostolic Church, the beacon of the Armenian nation, is weakened. International religious missionaries continue to flood into Armenia and Karabagh to convert these Christian people to their form of Christian belief. For these missionaries, their religion comes first and the nation second, thus weakening the national patriotism and unity of the Armenian people. Horrified by and fearing the weakening of their national religion, the Russian, Armenian, and other national religious leaders continue to express their outrage against indirect intrusion in their religious affairs. This is unethical, and a despicable move by the international religious powers to take advantage of these countries' difficult economic conditions. Growing neglect of the national religion, nation literature, arts, and entertainment is the means of destroying the national cultural heritage, a threat to its very existence. It is painful to see how the Big Brothers are trying to demoralize and destroy other countries' national unity and heritage while vigorously protecting and guarding their own national integrity and interests. As a constant reminder, to the people to express their patriotism, it has become compulsory at every big or small event taking place in the US for the people to stand up and pledge allegiance to the American flag by singing the national anthem and by displaying vast numbers of flags at gas stations, fast-food stores, schools, shopping centers, banks, clubs, corporate buildings, etc. You name it, they have flags on the premises. INDEPENDENCE MYTH All the newly independent republicans including Armenia and Karabagh, under the umbrella of democracy proudly declare that their country is free and independent. This is a dangerous deception and is far from the truth. They may be free but free of what? We may leave that question to international judicial interpretation. However, there is not a drop of truth in being independent. It is falsely indoctrinated by the Big Brothers and blindly accepted by the world community since it sounds good for their country's prestige. In reality, no nation in this world, especially under globalization, is independent. How could they be independent if the primary and most crucial national resources are controlled or owned by foreign powers? They are forever financially indebted to the Big Brothers. These independent countries cannot make any crucial decision in their countries' favor without being closely watched and controlled by the World Powers. As an inseparable part of the United States' globalization strategy, it is appropriate to bring to the reader's attention the explanation on Karabagh and the peace process, given by Carey Cavanaugh, Minsk Group US Co-Chair during his interview with Salpi Harutunian Ghazarian, published of AIM magazine (August/September, 2000). Mr. Cavanaugh, the USA courier diplomat, who previously was involved and failed in resolving the conflict between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus, as he declared, is now responsible for all the conflicts in the territory of the former Soviet Union except Chechnya. Speaking about the Armenian Genocide of 1915, he said, There were the tragic events of 1915; then, just a few years after that, the border was sealed and Armenia was incorporated no contact with Turkey until the 1990's. By tragic events, he meant the suffering caused by both sides, the Armenians and the Turks. Here, he is carefully avoiding the true events, the premeditated and carefully planned holocaust of a million and a half Armenians by the Turkish government, in which practically half of the Armenian population in Turkey was massacred. By trying not to offered Turkey, he is faithfully pursuing the US policy on this issue. So you (Armenians) have almost a century where there is no normal contact he continued. Today, when people in Armenia talk about Turkey, they are talking about the Ottoman Empire, - I think that Turkey of today is different-. WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT TODAY'S TURKS? Why should the Armenians think differently about Turkey? Are the Turks any different today when it comes to Armenia and the Armenians? If so, then why are they still denying the 1915 Holocaust of the Armenians so adamantly? Is it because, if they admit to the Holocaust, the Armenians will follow with land claims and demands for restitution, as the Jews have rightfully done? Being an expert in dealing with Armenian affairs, Mr. Cavanaugh should have known that the Armenian Holocaust did not end in 1915 but continued till 1923. This time it was under the direct order of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the father of the Republic of Turkey, and much celebrated and praised by Europe and the US for his modern stand. When the victorious allies called upon the surviving Armenians to return to their homeland, and assured them of a safe return to rebuild a new life, the Armenians naively believed them and returned, only to be massacred by the Turkish army and Turkish-Kurdish hordes. The allies betrayed the Armenians and abandoned them for their own greed in the overwhelming financial, military and economic interests in Turkey. How can the Armenians trust Turkey and believe that they have changed after the massacres of the Armenians in Sumgait and other province of Azerbaijan, which took place in 1988? Turkey never did acknowledge this massacre and even some Turkish papers applauded the Azeris' bloody act. Even the American press, in solidarity with their ally Turkey, were quiet and mum about this unbelievable massacre, in which the live bodies of women and children were burned, raping and killing occurred. When the Armenians in Karabagh retaliated, the American media rushed to call the Armenians murderers of the Azeri women and children, which in reality did not happen. In Shushi, Agdam and other towns, the advancing Armenian forces left an open passage for the Azeri population to leave. That's why the Azeris inherited so many of their refugees. But one may ask, Why didn't the Azeri government resettle them in the areas where, 300,000 Armenians once lived? Instead they intentionally kept these refugees in miserable living conditions for the world to react in their favor. How can the Armenians trust Turkey when Turkey today continues the genocide against their own Muslim Kurdish population? Turkey's threat to retaliate against any country's interests in Turkey and their citizens living in Turkey, should these countries adopt the resolution on the Armenian Genocide, clearly reveals Turkey's uncivilized behavior. It proves once again that today's modern Turkey is not different than the former Ottoman Turkey. Turkey till behaving as a low-ranking tribe among the civilized world. They tried for centuries to purify their race by forcibly converting and assimilating the Jews, Greeks and Armenians under their domination, but it seems with not much success. As far as the president of Turkey, Mr. Demirel, is concerned, the Armenians are most likely to trust the devil than him. There is no secret as to why the US government and its faithful agent, Mr. Cavanaugh, express their faith in modern Turkey, which Mr. Cheney, former Secretary of Defense, called our best friend. Since this is the undisputed truth, how can the US be an unbiased and honest and just broker in the Karabagh resolution process? AIMS OF US-TURKEY ALLIANCE We know Mr. Cavanaugh is in the Caucasus to fulfill the US-Turkey alliance against Russian, Iranian and Chinese interests, and to ensure the United States' military and economic interests, not only in the Caucasus, but with the help of Turkish/Turkic ancestral ties, by stretching its control from the Caucasus down to the Chinese border. Then they create NATO military bases on this stretch, forever isolating Russia from Central Asia. That is why the United States is vigorously assisting Turkey to build up its military strength by pouring billions of dollars' worth of modern military hardware into Turkey and, in the meantime, pressing other nations to reduce their armed forces: When Armenia receives a few planes ands tanks from Russia for its defense, the U.S. State Department does not waste any time in protesting the build-up of Armenia's armed forces, by complaining that it will jeopardize the ongoing peace process between Armenia and Azerbaijan, disregarding the act that Azerbaijan is receiving military supplies from Turkey, the Ukraine and even from Russia. Although the United States now denies its interest in establishing NATO bases in Azerbaijan and Georgia, it openly supports the military alliance between Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which, at a proper time, will become a suitable base for NATO. To fulfill this goal, the first important task for Mr. Cavanaugh is to persuade the Armenian government to hand over the Meghri district to the Azeris, which is the southeastern region of Armenia and borders on Iran (in exchange for international recognition of the sovereignty to Karabagh). This, of course, will open the doors to their well-planned adventure. If realized, this strategic NATO military barrier against Russia and Iran not only could be very critical for these countries' defense, but it would also be suicidal for Armenia and Karabagh. This could be the end of Armenia and the Armenian nation. Paraphrasing the words of the Armenian writer Leon Surmelian in I Ask You, Ladies and Gentlemen: After knowing all these facts, would you trust the agent, Mr. Cavanaugh, as a fair and impartial broker in the solution of the Karabagh conflict, when he has already taken a partisan position? Can Armenia and Karabagh survive as a nation under the globalization plan of the Big Brothers? Will Armenia and Karabagh survive as a nation under such unbearable and inhumane pressures imposed by the surrounding unfriendly neighbors and by the Western Big Powers, whose interests, unfortunately, coincide with those of the unfriendly nations? This worrisome question is on the mind of every-Armenian throughout the world. TENTS OF ARMENIAN SURVIVAL There is still a possibility and hope of over-coming this imposed national crisis. If, and only if, the governments of Armenia and Karabagh work closely, devoting themselves to their country's interest and looking after the people's welfare and their rights, and not become entrapped by the outside financial powers. If the people of Armenia and Karabagh continue to be strong and patient enough to withstand these inhumane conditions brought upon them by the Azeris and the Turkish blockade, and the demoralizing pressures by the Big Powers. If the Armenian government realizes that giving away Karabagh or Meghri is equally suicidal for Armenia and the Armenian people! And if it can assure their nation that Karabagh and Meghri are not for sale. If the national cultural heritage (art, music, literature, etc.) is taught and encouraged at all educational and social levels, as a bulwark against cultural genocide. If the Armenian and Karabagh military forces keeps their posts strong and alert, and military service becomes a source of national pride for the young servicemen, and not a suffering hell in the hands of their superior officers. If law and justice would apply to all citizens equally, regardless of their position and wealth. If corruption in the country, at any level of the public and private sectors, would cease. If the police would faithfully serve its people, protecting law and order, and not being an illegal money-sucking organization. If the hierarchy of the Armenian Apostolic Churches would come in their senses and unite, and vigorously fight the outside religious intruders. If the church hierarchy would recognize that the welfare of the people is a priority over the welfare of the churches. If the exodus and brain drain of the people from Armenia and Karabagh would cease. If the Diasporan Armenians' moral and financial support for Armenia and Karabagh will continue. The Diasporan Armenians' support is critical for the survival of Armenia and Karabagh. If some of the wealthy Diasporans would stop sponsoring the building of churches in Armenia and divert their money, as other well-to-do diasporans and charity organizations are doing, to building key highways, rebuilding rundown industries, schools, comfortable rest areas and motels at historical sites where tourists can be comfortable with their stay. Financially helping institutions of higher learning and Academy of Sciences, famous observatory at Byurakan, improving water supply lines, generating high-tech research facilities, helping farmers to become self-supporting, renovating the old historical churches, etc. If Armenia's nouveau riche would pay their share of taxes and develop a sense of relief for the unfortunates. If industry and business, will grow large enough to solve the country's unemployment problems and generate buying power among the population. If Russia is militarily strong and wise enough not to lose its control over the Caucasus to the USA-Turkey alliance. The survival of Armenia and Karabagh has always depended on Russia's military protection. Then, and only then, even under the darkest outside pressures, will Armenia and Karabagh survive as a nation.","Safarian, Sargis S",Armenian Reporter International,2001-03-17,0
"Karabagh Is Already an Independent State President Robert Kocharian of Armenia and Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan had their last - fifteenth - meeting in Paris on March 4 and 5. Mediator President Jacques Chirac of France made an upbeat statement after the conclusion of the meeting, hinting progress, Robert Kocharian was mute, while Heydar Aliyev was more vocal, blaming his Armenian counterpart for asking not less than independence for Karabagh. Although it was for public consumption back home that Aliyev squarely placed the blame on Armenia for not reaching an agreement in the Karabagh peace talks, most observers believe that the negotiations were not a total failure either, at least there was an agreement on certain principles which may serve as a basis for further talks. Aliyev is a seasoned politician who learned, during his long career as a Communist Party functionary, KGB officer, then General, and one-time Communist Party Secretary and Politburo member, how to survive, conspire, manipulate, connive and keep mute or attack, and to discard his opponents at the opportune time. Just taking a look at his political metamorphosis well tell a lot about this man and his character. From being a one-time Moscow stooge, devoted Communist and internationalist, he suddenly became anti-Russian, an ardent nationalist and devoted Muslim, who even made a trip to Mecca to become a hajji (pilgrim). No matter whose interests he served in the past, during the Soviet era, or whose interests he is serving now with the proposed Caspian oil pipeline projects, one thing is sure: he became a very wealthy man. Now that he has became old and frail, he wants his political dynasty to continue under Ilkham, his son. In order to achieve his objectives Aliyev recently said many things that only people who know him could understand; otherwise, ordinary people may never get it right as to what he is up to now. PREPARING FOR REALITIES During his long speech in the Azeri Milli Medjlis (Parliament) on February 23 and 25 of this year, he disclosed certain facts to the Azeri public in order to prepare them to face certain realities: Namely, Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh, for the past thirteen years, have been one country and Armenians already have achieved what they always wanted - independence and unification with Armenia. He even used the Armenian word miasnutyun (unity). In the three different published proposals presented by the OSCE Minsk Group Co-Chairs, recommendations according to Aliyev favored the Armenians and gave de-facto independence to Karabagh; only symbolically was Karabagh's loose association with Azerbaijan mentioned. According to Aliyev, none of the Co-Chairs ever called Armenia an aggressor even once. In order to recover the lost Azeri territories and Karabagh, proper Azeri military action is the only alternative, but war will be costly and a military solution will be opposed by others (European powers, the US, Russia and Iran). According to Aliyev, the Azeri opposition, which is controlled by people who once ran away during the early phases of the Karabagh war and profited from shoddy dealings, recently became an ardent advocate of a military solution and annexation of the Karabagh by force, has yet to come forward with its own proposals as to how to resolve this conflict. While demeaning the opposition and revealing their ineptness and impotence, Aliyev is also telling the Azeri people that Azerbaijan were to attack Armenia today, all the European nations would blame it for slaughtering the Armenians again. Master politician Aliyev has multidimensional approaches when he discusses available political options in the Karabagh peace negotiations. By whipping up war hysteria in Azerbaijan, he is bringing the realities of war into the home, saying that there would be enormous casualties and devastation likewise, and is hinting that those who are advocating war are not the ones who will likely carry the burdens of war but only the noise makers of cheap talk. Aliyev knows that if he stages a war he may end up with more lost territories, and Azerbaijan may face disintegration as Russian observers believe or hope for. Aliyev also knows that his only reliable ally, Turkey, will not risk a confrontation with Russia for the sake of Turkic solidarity and brotherhood. He made it clear when he said that others (Europe, the US, Russia and Iran) would oppose any military action. The only option I have, Aliyev said, is that we have to talk to the Armenians, as suggested by US, France, Russia and visiting European and NATO officials. NO CHOICE BUT TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATIONS Aliyev is alerting his countrymen that currently he has no choice but to continue negotiations and that Armenians in Karabagh are not going to settle for less than independence. He is reminding the Azeris that Armenians already had an autonomous status under the USSR but they were not satisfied with it. The implication is, what would make the Azeris believe that they (Armenians) will settle for a return to the old status that was rejected once. Aliyev then challenges his vocal militaristic opposition to come up with alternative solutions of their own, when it is clear that there are none. He is also successfully presenting his opposition as a group of immature adventurers incapable of coming up with constructive ideas to establish a dialogue with adversaries, and thus presenting himself to his constituents and the world public opinion as the only peacemaker and leader capable of making peace, and is asking for domestic and international help. Aliyev is also skillfully reminding his domestic enemies and political opponents that if they present themselves as the only guardians of Azeri territorial integrity and, for this purpose are advocating a military solution to the Karabagh conflict, then they should be ready for personal sacrifices as proof of their commitment. Shrewd Aliyev also warned his opponents with a veiled threat that we have to close opposition parties, newspapers, and place the entire economy in a war footing before waging a war to liberate the lost territories. Knowing the character of his people. Aliyev is trying to remind those warmongers that talk is cheap and questioning if they are really ready to meet the challenges and bear the consequences, like scaring those foreign financiers who invested multibillion of dollars in the Azeri economy and oil pipeline projects and who may withdraw their capital in case of war. PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THE NEGOTIATIONS What are the principles that the mediators are offering to the conflicting parties as a basis for negotiation? Here are the highlights, with a few delegations. Nagorno Karabagh and Nakhichevan have the right to free and unimpeded transport and communication with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia, due to understandable reasons, is objecting to this wording since it sees no linkage between the Karabagh issue and Nakhichevan. On the other hand, Azerbaijan is rejecting the following proposals which Armenia is agreeing to with certain reservations: Nagorno Karabagh's administrative borders are defined in accordance with the borders of the former NKASSR. Autonomous Karabagh Soviet Socialist Republic(which includes Azeri-occupied Shahumyan district as well). NKR forms its legislative, executive and judicial authority independently. Nagorno Karabagh has the right to establish direct ties with foreign states in the economic, scientific, cultural, sports and humanitarian spheres, and to have appropriate representatives abroad charged with implementing these ties. Nagorno Karabagh political parties have the right to establish ties with political parties in other countries. NKR is recognized as a free trading zone with a free circulation of currencies. NKR has a national guard and police force. NKR citizens have the right to do their military service on the territory of Nagorno Karabagh. The NKR budget consists of income generated on account of its own resources. Azerbaijan's army, security and police forces have no right to enter the territory of NKR, except when permission from the NKR authorities has been obtained (this is merely a symbolic gesture to the Azeris since no one anticipates that Armenians will ever need their presence). Nagorno Karabagh's citizens have Azerbaijani passports issued by only NKR authorities and will carry on the name of NKR. Karabagh citizens are not considered foreigners in Armenia and, according to the law of the Republic of Armenia; they can migrate to Armenia and gain citizenship in the Republic of Armenia. Finally, NKR borders will be determined as a result of negotiations on the points of agreement. Nagorno Karabagh has its own flag, coat of arms and anthem. The population of NKR has the right of dual citizenship, Armenian and Azerbaijani. NKR's citizens are to do their military service in the territory of Karabagh. The budget of NKR is independent. The official language of NKR is Armenian. The natural resources and riches on the territory of NKR belong to the people of Karabagh. The UN Security Council, represented by its permanent members USA, Russia and France, is the guarantor of the implementation of agreement mutually agreed by all conflicting parties. AZERIS BEATING WAR DRUMS In this letter of principles, there is no mentioned of Azeri territorial integrity or Azeri sovereignty over Karabagh. Azeri opposition is vehemently objecting to those principles and threatening to go to war to prevent its implementation. This Azeri behavior certainly explains why President Robert Kocharian didn't have to respond to Aliyev's charges when Azeri strongmen placed the blame on Armenians for not signing an agreement in Paris. Naturally, the President of Armenia couldn't give his affirmative nodding at the time when the Azeri opposition was beating war drums and thus proving that the Armenian side is correct for asking for independence and international guarantees when warmongers in Azerbaijan are blatantly threatening Karabaghis with invasion and deportation, like their Anatolian cousins did in 1915-23. The genocide experience taught a good lesson to the Armenians, that you cannot trust Turkish nationalists and extremists; while they pretend to negotiate with you, when the occasion presents itself, they won't hesitate to violate their promises and exterminate you. The battle cries of the Azeri nationalists are more than enough reason not to depend on the word of one man, Aliyev, who is 77 years old, ill and frail. One cannot tie the nation's fate with one mortal man's word when the entire Azeri opposition and would-be leaders made it plain on every occasion that they are not prepared to accept those principles proposed by the OSCE Minsk group Co-Chairs, which guarantee the Karabaghis the right to exist and control their political destiny. It is most amazing that the former President of Armenia and his supporters are falsely proclaiming that they negotiated better deals than the current one, when everyone agrees that present proposals are far more favorable for the Karabagh Armenians than the one that was negotiated by the team of Levon Ter-Petrossian and Gerard Libaridian. Azeri threats against the Karabagh Armenian population prove beyond a reasonable doubt that empty proposals are not a substitute to concrete agreements guaranteeing the well being and independence of Karabagh Armenians backed by the UN Security Council and its representatives, USA, Russia and France, as delineated in the co-chairmen's proposals.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-03-17,0
"Unappreciated Turkey? I have previously written about the probability that there would not be a Turkey as the world knows it today if the Western alliance of NATO did not keep the USSR from making Istanbul a port of entry to Russia. So there is no need to repeat that approach in detail. This week's piece will discuss the justification for the reasons why the Turks feel unappreciated. When one reads the news that flows from Turkey, with quotes from various Turkish officials, it causes one to wonder in what world they are living. It does not take a mental giant to understand that the Turkish officials and many of the reporters for the papers feel that there is a tremendous lack of gratitude on the part of Europe and most of the West for what Turkey has contributed to the West. As an example, Kamran Inan, chairman of the Turkish Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, replayed the old worn-out tune that the world has heard ad nauseam that Turkey was an indispensable ally to Western Europe and the US during the Cold War; Turkey joined NATO at its founding in 1949. We [Turkey] carried a disproportionate burden when Stalinism threatened the West, for we maintained the second-largest army in NATO, second only to the United States. NATO MEMBERSHIP NO FAVOR TO THE WEST It is interesting how the Turkish officials have a habit of taking a portion of the truth to contort the actual reality out of recognition. Yes, Turkey did join NATO, but not because it was doing the West the favor. They joined NATO because Stalin was causing sleepless nights in Ankara. They wondered if and when Joe Stalin would actually nullify the treaty that gave the territory, which was Western Armenia to Turkey. The fictionally disproportionate share that Turkey carried as their part of NATO was not any more than the minimum they figured was necessary to keep the Soviet hordes out of their back yard. Looked at in a different light, Joe Stalin was a good friend of Turkey. It was Moscow's threats that caused the West to send tons of money and huge caches of arms and ammunition into Turkey. It was Joe Stalin and his heirs that allowed Turkey to use communism's threat to continue to receive economic and military aid from the West. Without Stalin and his followers in power, Turkey would not have been placed upon the pedestal that they used to become the most powerful conventional military force in the region. So this alleged disproportionate share about which Mr. Inan complained is a figment of his imagination. Haluk Ilicak, head of the European Union Department at Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, argued that Muslim Turkey backed Western policies by refusing to arm its Muslim co-religionists during the conflicts in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Chechnya. What the head of the Turkish EU Department omits to point out is that, had Turkey armed its Muslim co-religionists, they would have violated NATO's bidding and could have faced stern (not military) measures from NATO, most of whose members belong to the EU. Had Turkey worked against NATO, the chances of Turkey becoming a member of the EU would have been reduced to zero. WHY TURKEY DIDN'T ARM CHECHENS Had it occurred, and if it were proven, that Turkey armed the Chechens against Russia, Moscow could have retaliated in a member of ways. The most likely would have been to rearm Ocalan and the PKK. Russia could have supplied the PKK with some of the most modern implements of warfare, which may have made the war the Soviets fought in Afghanistan seem like a picnic. Had that occurred, even Istanbul and Ankara would have been within range of the rockets that Russia could have supplied Ocalan and the PKK. Imagine a PKK that could have been trained in Russia to use ground-to-air missiles that can raise havoc with jets and helicopters. No one should forget that it was the US shoulder-fired stinger missiles that turned the war fought by the Soviets in Afghanistan. Feredun Sinirliogulu, the deputy director-general of the Middle East Department in Turkey's Foreign Ministry, reminded all that in matters of religion, we are Islamic. Mr. Inan agreed and added that Europe still has a crusader image of Turkey. Basically, Christian Europe is prejudiced against Islamic Turkey... Mr. Ilicak continued, From the time that Christianity spread to Europe across Asia Minor, Europe was defined in terms of Christianity, but the accession of Turkey will render this definition outmoded, and Europe will be rethought as a Christian-Islamic federation. It is interesting that a government that claims to be secular thinks and argues so much about Christianity and Islam. But it is plain that Turkey does not wish only to join the EU; it wants to change it into a club where Turkey, with the poorest economic standing of any country that has been allowed to enter, insists that it should have a lion's share in the definition of the EU. That arrogance which emanates from Turkey is astonishing. The tone with which Turkish officials flaunt their human-rights abuses as a necessary evil is not something that sits well in Europe. Turkey can call France and the rest of Europe hypocrites as loudly as it wishes, but Turkey is seeking to join the EU. To my knowledge, it is not the other way around. Unless major changes are made within the pseudo-democracy of Turkey, there is no guarantee that there will be a shoo-in ten years from now when the votes are counted. SELF-DEFENSE TOP PRIORITY It is not that Turkey has not been appreciated for holding up NATO's southern flank. But the powers in NATO recognize that Turkey did it for its own defense, not for the Turkish love of Christian Europe. Furthermore, except for the US being as frank as some of the nations in Europe, many NATO members, especially Germany and France, quite plainly state that Turkey has been more than compensated for being a part of the military alliance that kept the USSR from moving further westward. Had Joe Stalin sent tanks westward, Turkey could have been the first country devastated. NATO and the West kept Turkey safe from the USSR. To what more appreciation are they entitled? It is not a matter of Turkey not being appreciated. It is a problem that Turkey has not matured enough politically, socially and economically to be welcomed with open arms into the EU at the moment. The EU expected Turkey to abolish or reform Article 69 of its constitution that allows the government at a whim to eliminate political parties, cause them to cease activity, and place their leaders in prison. But instead, Turkey's constitutional court demanded a halt to the proceedings that would have brought about the necessary changes. This is just another clue that Turkey is not ready to join the EU and to abide by the EU's rules. This has nothing to do with appreciating Turkey; it has to do with Turkey not respecting the EU.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2001-03-03,0
"Daughters of Hayastan, Save Us! I see death. I see destruction. I see pillaging. It is the end. A nation is dead. I see life through hollow eyes, for my nation is perishing before me. What is causing our annihilation? Is it the armies of the terrible Turks, our hated enemies? No. Is an incurable plague wreaking havoc among the populace? No. Then why do they flee? Why do they run? To America. To Europe. To Australia. Do they not see? They will all be assimilated within two generations. Nothing will be left. My people gone. For they seek shelter, food, clothes, and, of course, jobs. Is it not God who should provide us with these things? And when they are gone, the Kurds will take our place, and life will be wonderful again for the Turks, as two problems will be solved in the turbulent Muslim Southern Caucasus. We must blame someone for this disaster. But who? Oh, we know, but we are afraid to say it. It is our leaders! They have betrayed us. They have sold their souls to the devil, and they live to see us suffer, so they can drive more BMW's. But why are we surprised? Our leaders have always betrayed. Raffi and [Gosdan] Zarian warned us. But we did not listen. And now we will die. Who can save us? God? If he did not save us during the Genocide, why will he save us now? Who will I call on for our salvation? I call upon all women of Armenian descent to save us in our time of need. Soon, all Armenians will have left our homeland and believing among odars who relish the opportunity to assimilate an ancient people. I charge our daughters with the sacred duty of marrying only Hyes. We must delay the assimilation, stop the white massacre, and I can think of no other way. When an Armenian woman marries an odar, it is 99% certain that the children will be lost. However, when an Armenian man marries an odar, their children still have a chance, for everywhere the children go, someone will ask, Are you by any chance Armenian? That constant reminding will perhaps one day lead to the planting of a seed, a seed that may grow into an Armenian patriot. But if the woman marries odar, there is almost no chance. Yes, it is sad that it comes down to our last name but what other choice do we have? We are dying. In America alone, Armenian intermarriage is almost 90%. We will not last another generation. Daughters of Hayastan, I beg of you, marry only Hyes. It is a solemn duty I beg you to accept. Women have always done a better job raising their children to speak Armenian, attend church, and to love their fellow Armenians. Sadly, our men have failed us miserably in such duties, just as our leaders have failed to lead. If we marry Hyes, we will remain Hye, and perhaps the day will come when we have competent and honest leaders, so that we may return to our ancestral lands and end our exile. And just as our men have been entrusted to guard the sanctity of our church through the priesthood, so I urge you, no, I implore you, daughters of the Hayrenik, only marry Hyes.","Nakashian, Andre",Armenian Reporter International,2001-02-03,0
"PERSPECTIVES: Nationalism - a new anthology BY ANDREW FEDYNSKY Late last year, Smoloskyp Publishers in Kyiv unveiled a massive anthology titled Nationalism. Need I say that publishing a book with that title is controversial and provocative? For many Ukrainians, the term itself is fraught with negative connotations and foreboding - even horror. During Soviet times, the mere accusation of Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism usually meant a death sentence or half a lifetime in a labor camp. Chillingly, the term could be stretched to fit just about anyone. Mykhailo Hrushevsky, for example, was routinely called a Ukrainian bourgeois nationalist. This was crude, but technically accurate: Hrushevsky was middle class and therefore bourgeois. As president of the Ukrainian National Republic, he was a nationalist. But what are we to make of Hrushevsky's rival, Mykola Skrypnyk? In March 1918 he became chairman of the first Soviet government in Ukraine so, clearly, he was a Communist, yet Stalin condemned him as a bourgeois nationalist, no different than Hrushevsky. In 1933 Skrypnyk became one of the countless victims of Soviet terror, committing suicide to escape the torture chambers of the NKVD. Hysteria over nationalism was not just a Stalin-era phenomenon. In 1959 the KGB assassinated Stepan Bandera. As the most prominent leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), Bandera, posed a potential threat to the Soviet Union, so for them he was a mortal enemy. But what about Petro Shelest? In the 1960s, he was the boss of Soviet Ukraine - a card-carrying Communist if ever there was one - yet 13 years after the murder of Bandera, Shelest was purged for Ukrainian bourgeois nationalism. Go figure. In a fascinating introduction to the Nationalism anthology, editors Oleh Protsenko and Vasyl Losovy point out that nationalism takes many forms. At its most sublime, it gives us Wagner's operas, the symphonies of Sibelius, Walt Whitman's poetry and Henryk Sienkewicz's novels. Taken to extremes, nationalism degenerates into horror: the trench warfare in World War I; the Nazi Holocaust. Europe is littered with gravesites of nationalism gone mad. For Ukrainians, the editors point out, Marxism-Leninism was just another form of Russian nationalism that Stalin took to genocidal extremes. President George Bush, of course, raised the specter of suicidal nationalism in his memorable speech to the Ukrainian Parliament. Ukrainians, however, were familiar with nationalism in its most homicidal forms and Mr. Bush's warnings were a flop. After all they'd been through with the Third Reich and the Soviet utopia, self-determination for Ukrainians seemed more like salvation than suicide. Now, 10 years later, the euphoria of independence is over and Ukrainians are working to untangle the mess the Soviets left behind. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Agency for International Development have been telling Ukrainians what to do to create a free-market economy. This is essential, of course, but what's also needed is a spark, an enthusiasm, a vision of what it means to be Ukrainian and where the country is going. For that, the country needs to tap into the mobilizing energy that nationalism - in the most positive meaning of that word - can provide. Call it patriotism, if you prefer. Ukraine could use some. Smoloskyp's anthology on nationalism is a timely publication. The hefty 870-page volume features selections from 37 authors, translated into Ukrainian from their original English, French, German, Polish and Italian. Included are political philosophers and historians like John Stuart Mill, Guiseppi Mazzini, Johann von Herder and Johann Fichte. Incredibly, these selections have never been available in Ukrainian before. That says a lot in itself. The anthology also features selections from Ukrainian writers like Ivan Franko, Hrushevsky, Yulian Bachynsky, Michael Sosnowsky exploring issues related to Ukrainian national identity and a variety of political perspectives, including Marxism. The anthology does not neglect Mykola Mikhnovsky and Dmytro Dontsov, the theoreticians who developed the ideological basis for the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), which played such a big role in 20th century Ukrainian history. According to the editors, nation-building is an intellectual process conducted by historians, linguists, novelists, poets and composers whose works help to define a people. For Ukrainians, that process essentially began with Shevchenko in the 19th century. It was short-circuited by the Soviet terror that began around 1930 and lasted into the mid-1980s. Not only were basic books from Ukrainian culture systematically destroyed; the authors who wrote them were murdered; the people who read them were imprisoned. Last year, I visited a mass grave in Berdychiv where teachers, journalists, poets, artists and others had been executed during the Great Terror. It was the size of half a football field. Every town and city in Ukraine, I was told, has a similar killing field for nationalists. Over time, people rigorously avoided what otherwise would be normal forms of national self-expression for fear of being labeled a Ukrainian bourgeois nationalist. Finally independent, Ukraine displays all the age-old symbols that had long been forbidden - the trident, the blue-and-yellow flag, the anthem, the language itself. Now Ukraine needs a sense of forward-moving destiny - a mobilizing nationalism, a healthy patriotism. This is politically complex and potentially dangerous. Ukraine, after all, includes people from many backgrounds and religions: Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Armenian, Tatar, Orthodox, Catholic, Jewish, Protestant, Muslim. A healthy sense of what is Ukrainian must recognize and respect the diversity of its many peoples. The Smoloskyp anthology is packed with fascinating essays and information. Since it requires a good knowledge of Ukrainian, it may not be for everyone. For Ukraine's political leaders and scholars, though, it will be a valuable tool to help them define who they are as a people and craft a positive vision for their country. Only then can they can proceed confidently and successfully down the path they chose when 90 percent voted for independence less then a decade ago.

"Prof. Mete Tuncay's Honest Assessment of the Armenian Genocide Exposes Prof. Halil Berktay's Weaknesses and Shortcomings Nese Duzel is a very fine Turkish Correspondent working for the leftwing Radikal (Radical) newspaper. She recently conducted very informative interviews with two well-known leftist Turkish historians, Professors Halil Berktay and Mete Tuncay, on 9/9/00 and 12/25/00 respectively. Each discussed the Armenian Genocide issue from different perspectives and angles. In order to assess their statements, confessions and definitions, one must be familiar with Ottoman-Turkish-history, and also must read the books, essays and articles of the renowned genocide scholar Professor Vahakn Dadrian, published by the organs of most credible universities and institutions. Without this background knowledge, the average reader could easily be misled or swayed by the statements of these Turkish historians. There are five fundamental issues that the reader must be familiar with before jumping to any conclusions: FIVE FUNDAMENTAL ISSUES 1 The premeditated nature of the Armenian Genocide organized and executed by the highest echelons of the Ottoman government, in order to cleanse the Ottoman Empire of non-Turkic stocks. 2 The participation of the Ottoman regular military forces in the extermination process, through the engagement of the Special Death Squads in cooperation with the Ottoman Interior Ministry; the volunteers involved consisted of criminal elements. 3 Many of the arch-perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide later took part in the nationalist movement under Mustafa Kemal and subsequently received very important official positions in the newly formed Republic of Turkey. 4 The extermination policy against the Armenians continued under the new nationalist leadership in Ankara, who wrested power from the Ottoman government in Ankara, General Kazim Karabekir attacked the first Armenian Republic, ex-terminating the Armenian remnants in the districts of Kars, Ardahan, Surmeli and Gumri. 5 There was massive confiscation of the forcibly abandoned Armenian lands and properties. Turkish Professors Halil Berktay, Mete Tuncay, and Taner Akcam all admit that the extermination of the Armenians was carried out by the Special forces, under the control of the Ottoman government. Berktay implies that the special death squads and volunteers consisting of criminal elements and enjoying the government's blessing were operating under the orders of the Interior Ministry. Yet both Berktay and Akcam, in order to avoid the wrath of the mighty Turkish generals, wouldn't dare implicate the Ottoman regular forces; instead, they deny their participation in genocidal acts. ADRIAN'S DOCUMENTATION CONCLUSIVE Professor Adrian's documentation proves otherwise. In fact, the vast majority of the Armenian recruits in the Ottoman Army were first converted to labor battalion soldiers and later exterminated by their comrades in cold blood and ordered by their commanders. The fundamental flaw in Berktay's historical accounts with reference to the Armenian Genocide comes in his assessment that the new leadership of the Turkish Republic had clean hands in the Armenian massacres and The Republic is not responsible for this affair. The distinguished scholar Adrian proves otherwise; namely, that many perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide later held very important official positions in the newly founded Turkish Republic. I would suggest to Professor Berktay to read the November 1991 (Vol. 23) issue of International Journal of Middle East Studies, the top, most prestigious academic quarterly serving all the Middle East experts, Ottomanists and Islamists, published by Cambridge University. In this issue, Professor Dadrian gives fine documentation of the accounts and names of the persons who were actively involved in the Armenian Genocide. Some of them were tried by the Ottoman Military Tribunal and condemned to death in absentia, while others were executed by the orders of Mustafa Kemal for political or personal reasons. However, most of the names are recognized as prominent leaders of the newly established Republic. A FEW NAMES To mention a few: Foreign Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Tefik Rusdu Aras, the brother-in-law- of blood thirsty Dr. Nazim. During the war he was Inspector General of Health and Sanitation. He was dispatched to the Armenian extermination sites to organize the covering of the corpses of the dead Armenians with a layer of lime in order to prevent epidemics among the Muslim population. The longtime Interior Minister of the Republic of Turkey, Sukru Kaya, had been head of the office in charge of the Armenian deportations during the war; his hands were stained with Armenian blood. Ali Cenani, Minister of Commerce of the Republic of Turkey, had been an arch-Ittihadist who had played a key role in deportations and massacres of the Armenians of Aintab. He enriched himself with stolen Armenian properties. At various times, Ministry of Finance and President of National Assembly of the Republic of Turkey, Mustafa Abdulhalik Renda, Talat's brother-in-law was Governor of Bitlis when he committed the most horrendous crimes against Armenians, such as burning them alive by the thousands, especially the Armenians of Mus and Mus valley. He repeated these crimes again as Governor in Aleppo in 1916. The Minister of Public Works of the Republic of Turkey, Pinincizade Feyzi, who was a deputy from Diarbekir during the war, organized the deportation and massacres of the Diarbekir Armenians. Ilyas Sami, deputy from Mus in the Republic's National Assembly, supervised in the same capacity the wartime burning and killing operations in the Bitlis province. Filibeli Hilmi, deputy from Ardahan in the National Assembly was the right-hand man of bloodthirsty Dr. Behaeddin Sakir; during the war he supervised the deportation and massacres of the Armenians from the province of Erzurum. Mazhar Mufit Kansu, President of the Eastern Independence Court of the Turkish Republic, was likewise implicated in the Armenian deportations and massacres. The list goes on and on. Professor Berktay either is unable to establish these connections because of lack of knowledge, or he prefers to be silent about them. ABDULHAMID ERA MENTALITY Professor Tuncay, in his interview, defends Berktay against Turkish nationalist militants who attacked him with a barrage of unfair criticism. Berktay had implicated the ottoman leaders in the matter of ordering Armenian massacres. Tuncay honestly states that those who proclaim national interests as a reason for denying the Armenian genocide are actually serving their own ideological or personal interests with an Abdulhamid II era mentality and are willingly becoming hired guns. He continues, Armenian deportations have economic implications. The Armenians used to be part of a prosperous community involved in successful trade and commerce; they owned real estate and vast properties. Then he asks the following valid question, Who claimed ownership over the land and properties abandoned by the Armenian deportees? adding that those who appropriated them wouldn't have the fortitude to try to find a solution for this problem. Naturally, those who perpetrated, organized and committed the genocide had intentions of seizing the land and properties owned by the Armenians, and eradicating the entire Armenian population so no one would reclaim ownership, and the purging of the land from unwanted elements would be completed. Professor Tuncay castigates the authorities for using threats against those foreign governments. which pass resolutions recognizing the Armenian Genocide. He states If intellectuals continue to maintain silence on this issue and fail to discuss it openly, who will be the loser, we as a nation or them? In democratic countries one cannot imagine such a resort to pressure on intellectuals in the name of national interests. There are people who, for their personal interests, are suppressing scientific and historical realities involving national interests. He is correct. Those numerous Turks, who enriched themselves with Armenian lands and properties, will continue to resort to any lies and distortions in order to maintain control over the wealth which rightfully belongs to the survivors of the Armenian Genocide. Tuncay is touching the most sensitive of chords, which Berktay is trying to avoid. Dadrian deserves the admiration and gratitude of every genocide scholar by brining forth the most damaging evidences, thereby denying the revisionist and the deniers the final victory.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2001-01-27,0
"SIDEwalks: As Grand Marshal, Clinton Can't Take Fifth BY TOM DEIGNAN CALL it a grand idea. Call it absurd. Laugh it off if you want to. But in recent weeks, quite a few letters have come to the Irish Voice suggesting that there is a way to honor Bill Clinton's efforts towards fostering a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Name him the Grand Marshal of a future St. Patrick's Day Parade up Fifth Avenue. New York's Irish community has a wonderful opportunity to honor a special friend of Ireland - president Bill Clinton, wrote Brooklynite Eugene J. O'Donnell. Soon to be a New Yorker, Clinton has fought with courage and has taken substantial risks to move the peace process in Ireland ahead. James Burke, from Sayreville, New Jersey, wholeheartedly agreed. On St. Patrick's Day the Irish would be wise to honor this man who is brilliant, articulate, warm and caring - and one who has not only worked his heart out for peace in Ireland, but for all Americans. Suffice to say, not all Irish Voice readers agree. I hope to heaven the Ancient Order of Hibernians will not abandon the management of the New York City St. Patrick's Day parade, John Kelly of Colorado writes, responding to recent reports about a shakeup involving local parade organizers. Nor should Bill Clinton ever become the parade grand marshal. He is the second most evil individual of the millennium... The parade would become a disgrace before the world and a mockery to all the Irish everywhere. Whatever happened to Irish pride and decency? Mr. Kelly does not disclose who, in his opinion, was more evil than Bill Clinton over the last 1,000 years. But he does suggest the degree to which Bill Clinton continues to divide Irish political observers. Well, Mr. Kelly will be happy to hear this: Bill Clinton could never lead the Irish up Fifth Avenue on the 17th of March. Neither could Hillary Clinton. And it has nothing to do with politics. Because neither could George W. Bush nor Dick Cheney lead the parade. Why? Because none of these folks are Catholic. According to long-standing AOH rules and traditions, Grand Marshals must be good-standing members of the Catholic Church. Bill Clinton has proven to be a master politician - but even he might have some trouble pulling this one off. The thing is, to be the Grand Marshal, you have to be a member of the AOH. To be in the AOH, you have to be a practicing Catholic, one long-time observer of Paddy's Day politics told the Irish Voice. It's been like that for...well over a 100 years, another recalled. Not surprisingly, given the behind-the-scenes battles that have been waged by parade insiders, nobody interviewed for this article wanted to be identified. Even though all we sought was confirmation of fairly well-publicized, thus far uncontroversial AOH guidelines. Nevertheless, as the Bill Clinton for Grand Marshal letters to the Irish Voice show, the AOH's rules are not that well known. And given the annual hue and cry over whether or not gays can or can't march up Fifth Avenue, it is interesting that few have ever bothered to yell in the name of a Protestant or Jewish or Muslim grand marshal. Of course, there is an undeniable logic to the current system - the AOH, it could be argued, is more Catholic than Irish. It runs the parade - so it should be free to set the rules. Yet you can also run into an odd situation. Forget discrimination for a moment. Consider that William Butler Yeats could not lead the St. Patrick's Day parade. Yeats - nor any of the great Irish patriots of Protestant background - could not even serve as aides to the grand marshal. (Each year, the 10 New York-area AOH divisions, and a handful of Catholic organizations are allowed to name aides.) Over the years, the AOH has shaken things up a bit. One person told the Voice that, at one time, only AOH members in the New York-area could serves as grand marshals. Now, AOHers from all over the world are apparently allowed to lead the parade. But to all of you Clinton for Grand Marshal supporters out there, let it be known: Only AOHers need apply. Photo (Former US President Bill Clinton.)","Deignan, Tom",Irish Voice,2001-01-23,0
"At Drexel University, Armenians and Turks Clash over Genocide About 150 people, many of them Turks, showed up on November 29 at Drexel University for a lecture on the Armenian Genocide. Ara Sarafian and Vincent Lima, the featured speakers, discussed History and Power: Politics of the Armenian Genocide. The occasion for the lecture was the publication, by the Gomidas Institute, of a new edition of the British government's 1916 blue book on the Armenian Genocide. In the book, Viscount James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee brought together scores of eyewitness reports to demonstrate that the Armenian massacres and deportations of 1915-16 must have been centrally planned. The new, uncensored edition of The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-16 includes hundreds of personal and place names that were excluded from the 1916 edition to protect sources still in Ottoman Turkey. Ara Sarafian, who prepared the uncensored edition for publication, noted that the book has come under repeated attack by Turkish nationalist historians as a forgery. In response, he discussed what he called the book's intellectual pedigree. The papers of Arnold Toynbee, Sarafian said, show that Toynbee was careful to include only reports that could be independently authenticated. Sarafian said that he has traced most of the key eyewitness accounts in the book to their signed originals. Expanding on the theme of denial, Vincent Lima expressed concern about allowing Turkey to set the agenda for Armenian scholarship. Lima, who is director of the Gomidas Institute, discussed research and publication on the Armenian Genocide and Armenian affairs generally. An Orchestrated Performance The question-and-answer period was dominated by an orchestrated performance by a dozen of the Turkish students. The opening salvo was the question, What were Armenians doing before the so-called Genocide? Were they sitting at home singing songs? The message, as Sarafian put it in response, was The Genocide didn't happen, and if it did, you deserved it. The Turkish performance continued with questions about various quotations read from prepared packages. One woman who claimed to be Turkish, Armenian, Greek, and Serbian (or some such combination), read an excerpt from an Armenian political tract calling for armed struggle against Turkish oppressors. A young psychology major explained how all reports by non-Muslim, non-Turkish eyewitnesses are unreliable because everyone has a bias. Another young woman, waging her finger, counseled Armenians to be careful, very careful about what they teach the younger generation. Mark Momjian, a prominent attorney in Philadelphia, was in the audience. He commented: Twenty years ago, if a brave Turkish-American came to a lecture on the Armenian Genocide, and had the nerve to ask a question or challenge an assertion, it was usually done so unprofessionally that the more the Turkish position was advanced, the more ridiculous it would come across to the remaining audience. Today, however, we have to accept the fact that Turkish-Americans have been armed with more sophisticated denial weaponry, and the Armenian community's response to this development should be, in my opinion, pro-active, not reactive. The lecture was organized by Drexel's Hellenic Students' Association and sponsored by the Armenian National Committee and the Armenian Youth Federation. It drew students from the University of Pennsylvania, Temple, Villanova, USP, and Drexel, as well as members of the Philadelphia Armenian community. Dozens of students and community members stayed long after lecture to continue the discussion. The uncensored edition of The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916 (edited and with an introduction by Ara Sarafian) is available from bookstores and directly from the Gomidas Institute (1-800-865-6405). The institute's Web site is at <www.gomidas.org>. Photo (Ara Sarafian editor of the Blue Book.)",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2001-01-06,0
"The Executions of Some of the Arch-perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide by the Ittihadists and Kemalists, 1915-1926 The existing literature on the World War I Armenian Genocide has but scant references to the acts and methods of retribution against the principal authors of the wartime mass murder. The reasons are obvious. First of all, those who were tried, convicted, condemned to death and eventually executed by the Turkish Military Tribunal in the 1919-1920 period of the Armistice, were an embarrassment to Turkey herself. The post-war Ottoman authorities only grudgingly and with much trepidation had agreed to institute these courts martial. Pressing national interests, such as prospects of favorable or mild terms of a peace settlement, were considerations making these trials for Turkey an urgent necessity at the time. After all, the Allies had let it be known in so many ways that unless Turkey redeemed herself by severely punishing those responsible for the massacres against the Armenians, the terms of the projected peace were most likely to be very severe. Furthermore, the punishment of these key actors of the genocide, who had managed to escape and had become fugitives of justice, had required elaborate measures of secrecy, detective work and many illegal arrangements. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation, otherwise known as Dashnaks, which masterminded these punitive operations, did not provide many details revealing organizational contacts, resources and methods of intelligence. What we know about the series of executions against such architects of the Armenian Genocide as Talaat, Dr. Behaeddin Shakir, Trabzon governor Cemal Azmi, Grand Vizier Said Halim and some other lesser figures, derives from the memoirs of the Armenian avengers who wee assigned by the A.R.F. to carry out the executions. These memoirs are inevitably embellished accounts in which to the dastardly and criminal image of the victim is countersposed the heroic sage of the individual executioner. What was common to both categories of Young Turk Ittihadist leaders or functionaries is the level and duration of apprehension with which they were haunted until they died at the scaffold or by bullets. There is, however, a third category of Turkish perpetrators, whose fatality has thus far escaped general recognition. Among these were brigand chiefs, the so-called çetebashis, who wrought havoc with thousands of trapped Armenian deportees of subjecting them to kinds of barbarities unexcelled even in Turkish history. They were most effective in their pursuit primarily because their charges, whom they led and directed, were almost entirely felons, carefully chosen blood-thirsty criminals who were released from the many prisons of the Ottoman Empire mainly, if not only, for this purpose. Then there are the chief Ittihadists who closely collaborated with Talaat and the Special Organization in organizing and implementing the massacres. Many of these were tried, convicted and condemned to death in 1926 by the Independence Court of the Ankara government on charges of conspiracy to kill Mustafa Kemal and take over the Turkish government. The brigand chiefs were killed individually by either Ittihadists or by Kemalists, whom they had joined in the Armistice period. Other perpetrators died as a result of heart attacks or strokes they suffered in connection with events related to the Armenian massacres. Finally, there is the category of suicide resulting from post-war despondency of one kind or another, and death by fatal accidents. I. Death by Conviction and Hanging Nearly all of these defendants were prominent ex-Ittihadists whose trials were divided into two judicial proceedings with venues in Izmir and Ankara. The first series started in Izmir on May 26, 1926 and ended on the day of the verdict, i.e., on July 13, 1926, when seven conspirators were condemned to death and hanged the same day at midnight. Of these, three were involved in the organization of the Armenian genocide, with two of them having played a key role. 1. Halis Turgut was a party operative and Parliamentarian. During the war he served as commander of a Special Organization contingent operating in Sivas province. He later operated at the Caucasus front, including the Nakhitchevan region in the 1917-18 period. To escape prosecution by the Turkish Military Tribunal investigating the crime of Armenian deportations and massacres, he had escaped in Sivas to the mountains with a small guerrilla unit. 2. Ahmed Shükrü was wartime Minister of Education, a fanatical Ittihadist and arch foe of the Armenians. He was hanged twice as the rope on his neck snapped the first time, with Shükrü collapsing on the floor half-dead and finally expiring on the gallows while emitting death-rattle sounds. This man, who helped send tens of thousands of inoffensive Armenian peasants to their gruesome deaths, was sufficiently terrified to cry out Oh! alas, Oh! alas, (Vah! Vah!) upon seeing the gallows on his way to execution. 3. Ismail Canbolat. He was the right-hand man of Talaat, was in charge of the empire's Public Security office (Emniyeti Umumiye), the Prefect of the Ottoman Capital, and later in the war, Interior Minister. The second series started at Ankara on August 2, 1926. It was set aside for a group of top Ittihadist leaders accused likewise of plotting to kill Mustafa Kemal and restore the Ittihadist regime and rule. The trials ended on August 26, 1926, and four very prominent Ittihadists were executed on the gallows at 10 p.m. the same night. One of them was Economic Minister Cavid, whose role in the scheme of the Armenian genocide, if any, was negligible. But the other three were perhaps the most ferocious organizers of it - next to Talaat. 1. Dr. Nazim. A central figure in the Supreme Directorate of the party and, in many respects, the brain trust of the very conception of the wholesale destruction of the Armenians. He operated behind the scenes and exerted great influence in the councils of the party leadership, including Talaat. He approached the gallows in a state of shock and trembling, protesting his innocence with such words as vallahi (I swear, I swear!) 2. Yenibahçeli Nail. Ittihad's Responsible Secretary for the province of Trabzon, and at the same time the head of the Special Organization forces of the province, whose Armenian population was subjected to the most severe forms of expulsion and destruction through massacres, sparing neither children, the infirm nor the old. But on the gallows he pleaded with his son to take good care of his mother and siblings. 3. Filibeli Hilmi. Ittihad's Delegate for the province of Erzurum, where he served as Dr. Behaeddin Shakir's right-hand man, and as the chief of the total Special Organization forces of the entire region. The deportation and extermination of that province's large Armenian population was supervised by him. Like ex-Education Minister Shükrü, he too fell from the gallows as the rope snapped during the execution, and he too was hanged twice. It is significant to note that, already during the Armistice, Mustafa Kemal had decried the Ittihadist leaders for their war crimes, including the Armenian massacres. In an interview with Maurice Prat, the special correspondent of Petit Parisien, he had exclaimed: Qu' attendant les Alliés pour faire pendre toute cette canaille? (Why do the Allies delay having all these rascals hung?). II. Ittihad Executing Some Brigand Chiefs Involved in the Genocide Foremost among these are two party officers who devastated the border regions in the east of Turkey with inordinate savagery and repeatedly boasted about their lethal role in this respect. 1. Çerkez Ahmed. Major in the army. He was the main assistant of Van governor Cevdet in the campaign to liquidate the Armenian population of the province. He later served under Diyarbekir governor Dr. Reshid and, in the process, carried out the murder of Vartkes and Zohrab, the two Armenian Deputies in the Ottoman Parliament. Charged with the crime of murder and plunder. He was court-martialed, convicted and hanged, along with his consort, Lieutenant Halil, by Cemal Pasha in Damascus on September 17/30, 1915. When commenting on this execution, Cemal's Chief of Staff, General Ali Fuad Erden, noted, Indebtedness to executioners and murderers is bound to be heavy...those who are used for dirty jobs are needed in times of exigencies [in order to shift] responsibility. It is likewise necessary, however, not to glorify but to dispose of them like toilet paper, once they have done their job. When ordering his court martial and sentencing, Talaat, for his part, is quoted as saying, His liquidation in any case is necessary. Otherwise he will prove very harmful at a later date [on account of his knowledge of and involvement in the massacres]. 2. Yakub Cemil. Major in the army. Like Çerkez Ahmed, Cemil played a major role in the extermination of large clusters of Armenian populations in eastern Turkey. However, he had a falling out with Enver and Talaat and began to threaten them. He too was tried, convicted and executed on September 11/24, 1916 as a result of the intervention of Talaat and his crony Kara Kemal, who succeeded in railroading his conviction. 3. Kurdish Brigand Chief Amero. After he carried out the mutilation and murder of 636 Armenian notables of Diyarbekir on orders of Governor Dr. Reshid, he was set upon by 10 Circassian brigands and killed on orders of the same governor and Diyarbekir Deputy Feyzi, two arch organizers of the mass murder. 4. Kurd Murza Bey. Kemach Defile Brigand Chief. He boasted of having killed 70,000 Erzurum province Armenians passing though the Kemach defile. He was shot dead following a decision by his superiors that he could prove dangerous afterwards on account of his penchant for boasting. 5. Cemal Pasha hanged a number of Kurds for participation in atrocities against Armenians in Islahiye. 6. Vehib Pasha hanged two officers of the Special Organization for organizing the massacre of 2,000 Armenian labor battalion soldiers in Susehir, Sivas. III. Kemalists Liquidating Brigand Chiefs Involved here are three prominent Special Organization chieftains, whose brutality and blood-thirstiness against their Armenian victims constitute legends in the macabre sage of the World War I Armenian genocide. 1. Yahya Kaptan. He was in charge of the massive drowning operations at Trabzon harbor on the Black Sea littoral. Thousands and thousands of Armenian children, women and old men would be loaded on lighters, taken to the high sea and thrown overboard after being bayoneted by boatmen from other boats accompanying them. Yahya Kaptan later joined the Kemalist insurgents without, however, completely severing his ties to the Ittihadists, especially Enver. This suspected duplicity sealed his fate; he was ambushed and killed by unknown assassins in Trabzon in July 1922. It should be noted, however, that Yahya Kaptan, during inquiries into his loyalties, had threatened to reveal all he knew about the state secrets in the event he was to be pressed hard with such inquiries and investigations. 2. Topal Osman. Milice Colonel. A veteran guerrilla from the days of the 1912-1913 twin Balkan wars, Osman during the war operated in the eastern border regions, as a Special Organization brigand (chétté). He too repeatedly had bragged about his murder missions against the Armenians. After the war he too joined the Kemalist insurgents and, in the process, organized extensive massacres against Greek populations in the Trabzon area as reprisal, as well as against clusters of surviving Armenians. He eventually was awarded by Mustapha Kemal with the position of Chief of the Personal Guard Contingent with duties to protect M. Kemal. But he incurred the wrath of the Kemalist Deputies in the fledgling Parliament in Ankara when he lured a deputy to his home and out of spite strangled him. He was killed during an exchange of gunfire with military units trying to capture him, and his corpse was subsequently hanged in front of the Parliament in March 1923. 3. (Deli) Halit. Colonel, later General in the Turkish Army. As a Special Organization officer, he too was a participant in the killing operations in the eastern provinces. An ardent Ittihadist, he subsequently became an ardent Kemalist, while being sought by the post-war Turkish Court Martial as a suspect in the crime of massacres. A cantankerous and defiant man, he got embroiled in altercations with other Kemalist leaders and deputies and was shot dead during one of these broils in the vestibule of the Turkish parliament on February 9, 1925. IV. Suicides of Top Ittihadists Involved in the Genocide 1. Dr. Reshid. Governor of Diyarbekir Province. Following his arrest, escape from Bekiraga prison, and recapture by Istanbul police. Dr. Reshid shot himself to death in January 1919. He was one of the most ferocious governors, who with great zeal executed Ittihad's plan of genocidal destruction of Diyarbekir Armenians, as well as multitudes of other Armenians who had to pass through that city, which was a hub for deported convoys, en route to the deserts of Mesopotamia. 2. Mahmud Kâmil. General. Commander of the Third Army, 1915-1916. His command zone encompassed the 6 Armenian provinces, plus Trabzon province, whose extermination was entrusted to him by Ittihad and of which he was an ardent member. He gave special orders not to spare the old, the infirm or the pregnant women from the perils of deportation. He also threatened to hand in front of his house any Muslim who might dare to provide shelter to any Armenian. On November 28, 1922 he took his life through suicide. 3. Kara Kemal. A top Ittihad leader and the alter ego of party chief Talaat. All secret deliberations and plans of the party were under the supervision of Kemal at Ittihad's headquarters in Nuriosmaniye. He was indicted along with other Ittihadists by the Independence Court in 1926 on charges of conspiracy to murder Mustafa Kemal but had managed to escape. When caught in a chicken coop, he shot himself to death on July 29, 1926, 4 days before he was formally indicted. V. Accidents 1. Nuri Pasha Killigil. Commander of Army of Islam, Transcaucasus and Baku. Brother of War Minister Enver, Nuri was responsible for the perpetration of a series of massacres in Russian Armenia and Azerbaijan, especially the 1918 September Armenian massacre in Baku. After World War I, Nuri became a businessman and by the end of World War II, he had become an industrialist, opening a factory for weapons and ammunition in Istanbul. On March 2, 1949, he perished, along with others, in the rubble of that factory which was blown to pieces following a huge explosion and a conflagration engulfing the entire complex in massive flames. 2. Mehmed Memduh. Erzincan District governor, Erzurum province. (Subsequently consecutively Governor of the provinces of Bitlis, Baghdad, Musul). He was the chief organizer of his district's massacres, in close cooperation with the local operatives of the Special Organization. He accumulated great wealth acquired through his Armenian victims but died in a fatal auto accident while trying to establish a business in Smyrna (Izmir) after the war. VI. Heart Attacks and Strokes 1. Hashim Beg. Deputy from Malatya in the Parliament. A fanatic Ittihadist and foe of the Armenians, he sponsored his son Muhammed Beg's operations as a brigand chief of the area, carrying out a series of massacres annihilating Malatya's Armenian population. Following a quarrel with an old Kurd about a stolen horse and an attack on him, Muhammed Beg was shot by the son of the Kurd. Deputy Hashim, his father, thus suffered a stroke and, after much agony, he died in 1917. 2. Sagir Zade. Mufti of Malatya. He directed the strangulation of the Armenian Catholic Primate of Malatya, after subjecting him to manifold tortures and body mutilations for having refused to convert to Islam. Barely back home, the Mufti suffered a stroke and died instantly.","Dadrian, Vahakn N",Armenian Reporter International,2001-01-06,0
"Europe and Turkey On December 13, 1999, the Helsinki European Council decided to grant Turkey the status of an applicant country for accession to the European Union (EU) and, in accordance with the Copenhagen Criteria, put forward certain recommendations and requirements. However, the Council made it clear that accession negotiations cannot begin until Turkey complies with the Copenhagen Criteria which reflects European Shared Values. Those Shared Values are the basic principles in every civilized society where democratically elected governments protect and secure its own citizens' fundamental universal rights, such as tolerance for other religions, cultures and minorities, the protection of human rights and democracy. A list of priority items that European countries are asking from Ankara to comply with includes granting cultural rights to the Kurds, abolishing penal codes for allowing imprisonment of political dissidents, and eliminating military intervention in courts and political life. EU'S DEMANDS ON TURKEY In order for an independent judiciary to be established in Turkey, European nations are asking Turkey to abolish the notorious State Security Courts controlled by the military, and to lift the State of Emergency in the Kurdish region of Turkey. As a goodwill gesture, Europe demands the release of the imprisoned former Turkish parliament member of Kurdish origin Leyla Zeyna, winner of the European Parliament Sakharov Prize. The EU calls on Turkey to strengthen civil society, consolidate the democratic system and support of free and independent media. The EU proposes to set up discussion forums, which consist of eminent politicians from the European Union and Turkey, as well as representatives of civil society. The EU also requires each member country to resolve any outstanding disputes with neighboring states via peaceful means. The EU calls on the Turkish government to improve its relations with all neighbors in the Caucasus and, in particular, with Armenia, within the framework of a Stability Pact in the region. The EU calls on Ankara to withdraw its occupation forces from Cyprus, and sort out its quarrels with Greece in the Aegean dispute and stop violating the Iraqi border on the pretext of pursuing Kurdish insurgents. When the Turks wanted to be part of Europe, they had different agendas. With a projected population of 100 million in thirty-five years and a rapidly expanding but a problem-ridden economy, Turkey needs new markets for their textiles, agricultural and industrial products; therefore, they want to be part of the European Custom Union Pact. Turkey also has high inflation and an increasing dreadful unemployment rate; therefore, it wants to export its workers to Europe in order to deflate social tension at home. Per-capita income in the Turkish household is about $3,000 a year, whereas it is $12-15,000 in Israel, Greece and Cyprus, and $22,000 in the EU countries. WHAT TURKEY WANTS OUT OF EU Turkey wants to be part of a group which formulates policies and makes decisions within the framework of institutions involved in Common Foreign Policy and European Security and Defense Policy, in order to control it or channel it or make it more suitable for their national security and foreign policy needs. For this, they are proposing to deploy 6,000 Turkish troops under proposed European Security Forces. Turks took great satisfaction when they sent their troops to the former Yugoslavia to protect Muslim Bosnians and Albanians against the historically inimical Christian Serbs and underscored their victory against Slavs (including Russians.) Is Europe prepared to accept Turkey? Yalcin Simsel, in the Turkish Daily on 11/22/00, reports, Turkey has little chance of EU membership. He adds, With the population bordering on 70 million, a fearsome unemployment rate, unfair distribution of income, an unstable political system, an undeveloped democracy, a low level of education and poor population, Turkey would only be a hunch on the back of the EU. What former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said in his latest book, Die Selbstbehauptung Europas, Perspektiven fuer das 21 Jahrhundert (The Self-Assertion of Europe, Prospects for the 21st Century), published in Berlin as reported by Deutsche Presse-Agentur on 11/02/00, supports this argument. The former chancellor stated, Turkey should be barred from joining the European Union; given its great cultural differences and geographical concerns I must recommend against taking Turkey into the European Union. Helmut Schmidt lists a series of reasons for not admitting Turkey to the 15-nation European Union. He cites its large population, Islamic religion, cultural differences, disputes with neighboring states, human-rights violations, lack of democracy, poor state of economy, etc. as reasons, and he continues, It would be both a mistake and dishonest of EU leaders to make Turkey a candidate. GUNDUZ AKTAN'S VIEW Gunduz Aktan, in Turkish Daily News on 11/21/00, makes the following observations. The European Parliament may be an assembly with limited powers, but that doesn't change the fact that it represents the European public's opinion and conscience, and the public's views are of utmost importance for a candidate country (Turkey) during the accession process. Then this seasoned diplomat reaches the following conclusion: The European Parliament has declared, for the second time (1987 and 2000) that we subjected Armenians to genocide. Yet the European Parliament decision, taken in a coordinated manner with the French and Italian Parliaments' similar moves, is extremely serious. Turks are being portrayed as a nation guilty of genocide. We cannot possibly ignore that. Is the European Parliament using the Armenian, Kurdish, Cypriot and Greek factors as a pretext to bar Turkey's ascension to the European Union for political the European Union for political consideration, or is the EU genuinely concerned with the Turks' attitude and wants Turkey to meet the qualifications set forth by the Copenhagen Criteria? According to Turkish diplomat Gunduz Aktan, This decision indicates the profoundness of the prejudices against Turkey in EU countries, and this determines the EU stance regarding human rights, democracy, Kurdish, Cypriot and Aegean problems. It is ironic that even the most Western-oriented Turkish intellectuals are ready to charge others with prejudice yet miserably all fail to recognize their own shortcomings. This space is too small to go into the details of those deficiencies. RECENT ARMENIAN GAINS According to foreign policy officials in Ankara, the foreign policy course of Armenian President Robert Kocharian received an actual blessing from Roman Pope John Paul II when the Latin Church recognized the Armenian Genocide. They further stated, In light of the recent resolutions of the French Senate and Italian parliament, Pope John Paul II's statement was interpreted by the majority of experts as the beginning of a chain reaction capable of converting the Armenian problem into one of the actual problems of international relations. Ilnur Cevik, in TDK's 11/20/00 issue, goes even further: The Armenian lobby is achieving its goal of antagonizing and frustrating Turkey and, if possible, alienating the Turkish public (from EU) and thus isolating our country. Some poorly informed Armenians are dropping their guard and looking for alternatives other than the Armenian Genocide Recognition to reconcile with Turks, without appreciating the impact of the Armenian Genocide Resolutions on Turkish academia, foreign policy establishments and public opinion. The Turkish public is better informed now than before the Armenian Genocide Resolution was brought to a Congressional hearing; in fact, quite a few Turkish intellectuals are expressing their reservations about longstanding officials lines, and policy makers are looking for alternatives to improve their image in Europe and struggling to present their version of history. The Armenian Assembly of America, under the leadership of Van Krikorian, Aram Kaloosdian and Ross Vartian, and ANCA under the tireless efforts of Aram Hamparian, Elizabeth Chouldjian and Christopher Hekimian, are doing tremendous work, of which all can be proud. They are not only serving the Armenian national cause, but they are also preparing the ground to conduct a meaningful dialogue between Turks and Armenians since, with the recent Armenian successes. TURNING THE TABLES OF TURKEY The Turks are now realizing that the Armenian issue is a serious one that they cannot afford to ignore. They are now gradually conceding that denials, distortions and falsifications or use of threats didn't yield the desirable effect. On the contrary, the Armenian Genocide issue is now being used against Turkey, to force them to accept criteria set by the EU if they want to be an integral part of the civilized world community. In fact, through their demands, the Armenians are indirectly helping the Turks to reform their society, and grant academic and journalistic freedom to their intellectuals so they can freely discuss their deficiencies. Despite these positive developments, there are also recent ominous developments in Turkey that one cannot ignore. According to the Armenian Genocide Research Center (AGRC), the Turkish daily Akit is attacking Judge Naci Unver and his three colleagues for overruling the Prosecutor of the Fifth State Security Court decision to ban the publication of Vahakn Dadrian's book under the title of Genocide as Problem of National and International Law. According to AGRC, Judge Naci Unver and his three colleagues are now accused of endorsing charges of mass murder made in the book. The accusers are claiming that the three judges, in contrast to their two other colleagues, used ideological criteria in their deliberations, instead of relying on legal standards. The recently proposed Turkish Penal Code, Article 359, which will treat the use of the phrase Armenian Genocide as a criminal offense, punishable by imprisonment, and the above-mentioned harassment of brave Turkish judges proves that the Turkish Generals, the real rulers of Turkey, are still having difficulty understanding that they have to comply with the Copenhagen Criteria if they want Turkey to be integrated into the EU. Individuals or organizations interested in participating in the solution of the Armenian Cause (Hay Tadh) should rally around the credible Armenian lobbyist organizations - the AAA and ANCA - for their guidance and give their utmost financial and moral support to ANI (Armenian National Institute), Zoryan Institute and AGRC (Armenian Genocide Resource Center). In order to establish a credible dialogue with the Turks in the future, Armenians should be well prepared under the guidance of professional organizations already known for their experience and reputation.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-12-09,0
"Rome Journal: Immigration Issues Ignite Debate Italy is surrounded by three sea: the Adriatic, the Tyrhennian, and the Ionian. These are all part of the Mediterranean, but given the ins-and-outs of the peninsula's coastline, these waters have had local names from time not remembered. The waters are currently part of Italy's dilemma. Hardly a day goes by without a boatload of refugees landing in some corner or cove. Recently, a boat with over 60 Kurds was detained off the coast of Puglia, a province in the south. Like many other, they had paid a king's ransom to get a Turkish boat-owner to ply them to Italian shores. The Turks jumped ship before the Kurds were taken into detention. The Italian authorities turn a blind eye to this kind of thing. They know the Kurds are on their way to Germany, so they process them and let them go. The problem is that not all refugees just want to pass through Italy on their way to somewhere else. They want to stay here. Where do they come from? A recent study of Milan shows Filipinos to be the largest community, followed by Sri Lankans, Egyptians, Chinese, Peruvians, and Moroccans. There are Sudanese, Ethiopians, and Libyans as well, along with the Albanians who are a stone's throw away, and always sneaking across to one of the southern ports. If the US government complains that the Rio Grande is porous, then the Mediterranean is a flood. Do the Italians want these immigrants? The answer is yes and no. There is no doubt that they need them to do the work that Italians no longer want to do. There is only 46% of Italians in the work-force, and the birth rate among Italians is at 1.2 infants per couple, some say zero. This spells economic problems without people to fill the low-paying jobs. It also spells social trouble if the migrants are not easily assimilated. Voices in the centrist and rightist political parties are calling to make illegal immigration a crime. Some voices in the Church are calling for government to set priorities on the kinds of immigrants allowed to come and to stay. The Catholic Bishops conference expresses concern over the right-wing, proposals to make illegal immigration a crime, saying that it damages fundamental values protecting every human person. Cardinal Martini of Milan has called for more affordable-housing for newcomers who have taken up and low-paying jobs in northern Italy, while officials in Verona, with the endorsement of Bishop Flavio Carraro, have begun to build housing units with rents as low as fifty dollars a month for the newcomers. Despite these signs, there is a growing discontent among the people, and the centrist and rightist parties will make illegal immigration an issue in their political campaigns this year. It is not an essay issue, and people have different sensibilities about it. A letter read in all parishes this Sunday will ask people to be attentive to the needs of immigrants even if they seek integration without assimilation into Italian society. This is shorthand for even if they are Muslim, and this is where the rubber will eventually hit the road.","MacPhaidin, Bartley",The Boston Irish Reporter,2000-12-01,0
"Commission for Social Justice Responds to Criticism of Columbus Celebration The Commission for Social Justice (CSJ), the leading anti-defamation organization for the Italian-American community, has responded to criticism from various groups which represent native Americans and Hispanics, concerning activities planned throughput the country in celebration of Columbus Day. Particularly, the parade in which CSJ and Order Sons of Italy in America (OSIA) members are participating on Saturday, Oct. 7, in Denver, is at the center of attention. Denver's Columbus Day parade has been picketed and interrupted over the years by groups who consider Columbus' discovery of America an invasion, and accuse him of genocide and colonialism. The once annual parade was cancelled in 1992 due to threats of violence and this is the first year it has resumed. Groups in opposition to the parade have threatened violence if Columbus' name is used in this year's parade. The Denver Post reported that the condition of omission of any Columbus references was forced upon parade planners after the original parade permit was granted. Parade organizers states that they would march anyway. In an effort to curb potential violence, representatives from the Italian-American, native American, and Hispanic communities have met numerous times with city officials to try to resolve the situation. The U.S. Justice Department was called in to negotiate. March for Italian Pride was suggested as an alternate name for the parade, but Italian-American groups and parade organizers feel this is an infringement of their First Amendment right to free speech. What they are asking us to do is a violation of our rights as Americans. We have the right to celebrate individuals and events that are significant to us, as long as we are within the confines of the law, CSJ National President John Dabbene said. We will celebrate Columbus and our ancestry peacefully, as we do every year across the country. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has spoken out in favor of the rights of the parade organizers. The CSJ acknowledges Columbus' documented involvement in the mistreatment of Native American peoples. But, judging a 15th Century man by 21st century values and standards is unfair, observes Dabbene. Slavery was not prohibited by Great Britain, creator of the Magna Carta (1215) until 1833, and the United States permitted slavery until the adoption of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Remnants of the slave trade (especially that of Muslim powers) persisted until international action against it began in the late 19th Century. As inherently wrong as slavery is, still it was the universal norm, CSJ National Executive, Ph.D., said. Columbus did not introduce slavery or colonialism to the Americans. The pre-Columbian Aztecs widely practiced both, along with such ignoble deeds as torture and human sacrifice by the thousands. There has also been frequent criticism that claim Columbus was not the first to discover America. The CSJ recognizes the existence of evidence that numerous individuals may have reached the Americas prior to Columbus, including Vikings, Africans, Chinese, Jews, and the British. Nevertheless. historians generally agree that Columbus' landing was of definitive and lasting significance, Piceigallo said. Columbus' landing on the Americans was the beginning of prolonged and continuous contact between the Old World and the New world. It was the commencement of the world as we know it today, he added. The CSJ profoundly regrets any harm done to innocent people or to the environment as the result of European discoveries and eventually settlements in the New World However, the CSJ refuses to condemn 15 century behavior from the more enlightened perspectives of the 21st century, Dabbene said. He added that Columbus serves as an important symbol of courage, ingenuity, creativity, and the strength of the human spirit for Italian Americans. Rather than condemning Columbus, the CSJ encourages the celebration of his achievement as the historically decisive opening of dialogue, trade, and travel between Europe and the Americas, he said. Columbus should not be blamed for everything negative associated with a highly industrialized, technological, urbanized, crime-saturated, and toxic-waste-ridden society, Piccigallo added. All human endeavors are necessarily flawed. The CSJ has called for universal temperance, fairness, and balance on the part of those who would use the Columbus celebrations to exploit and promote, for political or other purposes, the real or perceived shortcomings of Columbus, his discoveries, and the consequences of his actions. The CSJ is the anti-defamation arm of the Order Sons of Italy in America (OSIA), the largest and longestexisting organization of Italian-American men and women in the world. Founded in 1905, OSIA represents one-half million members throughout the United States.

"Issues and Principles Paramount in Conflict Between Turks and Armenians During the discussion of any social, economic, scientific, historical or political issues, there or contradictions based on virtues, emotions, facts, beliefs or interests. Even when the arguments are based on verity and realities, one may always find someone who will try to challenge it in its entirely in order to prove their counterpoint even if its content is devoid of factuality. The Turkish-Armenian arguments in terms of the definition of genocide, the evaluation of past and present bilateral relations, and ways to improve mutual rapport remain the subject of different interpretations and suggestions not only among Turks and Armenians, but even within their own respective groups as well. It is true that the Turks are pursuing a more cohesive policy in this regard, thanks to their state-controlled collective thinking and the cohesiveness of their society. Armenians, in contrast, are more divisive, due to their individualistic approaches, and certainly the Turks are taking full advantage of it. INCREASING RECOGNITION OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE One after another, many countries' legislative bodies are now recognizing that what happened in 1915-1923 was indeed genocide. Already the legislative bodies of Uruguay, Argentina, Russia, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Belgium, Sweden, France, and now the Papal Office, recognize the historical fact that the Armenian Genocide did happen, and the legislative bodies of other countries, like Italy, Germany and the US, may join their ranks sooner or later. The Turks are aware that there are documents in the archives of the US, UK Germany, Austria and Russia, which implicate the Ottoman government with the crime of genocide. The most credible eyewitness accounts by the missionaries stationed in wartime. Turkey, and statements by the diplomatic corps, including German military personnel, all indicate that the disappearance of the Armenian population was the result of the premeditated, preplanned genocidal policy makers in Ankara are now running a very sophisticated misinformation and propaganda campaign, utilizing deceptive methods to mislead everyone, including Armenians. It is useful to review the following recent developments. 1) Ankara announced that it has established an Armenian chair and created a commission to study Armenian allegations in historical perspectives. In order to prove that there was no genocide, Turkish and foreign historians will be asked to check the Ottoman documents to determine what happened in 1915-1923 - was it an act of genocide or were the deaths among the Armenians, Turks and Kurds the result of inter-communal fights? Ankara is quick to add that the documents extant in the Ottoman archives will prove that the so-called genocide never took place, and there are no documents to prove that the ottoman government gave the orders to annihilate the Ottoman Armenian population; on the contrary, there were orders to provide protection to the Armenian deportees. What this means is that the Armenian chair and commission are being set up to prove that the alleged genocide never occurred. According to critics, rather than trying to find out the facts, the Turks are already reaching a conclusion, which is based on their version of history. In the meantime, they are already working on a new penal code, whereby if any Turkish historians and academicians ever use the term Armenian genocide, they will be subject to imprisonment and severe penalties. This will make it virtually impossible for them to produce any impartial historical fact-finding studies. Yet the Turkish authorities are attempting to create the impression that honest efforts are being made on their part, with the intent of forestalling the passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution by the legislative body of any given foreign country. NIX ON ARMENIAN GENOCIDE RESOLUTIONS 2) The Turks are issuing a warning that if the legislature of any foreign country passes the so-called Armenian Genocide Resolution, Turkish-Armenian relations will suffer, Ankara is threatening to take unspecified measures against Armenia, thus trying to create an impression among concerned countries that the passage of such a resolution will have adverse effects on bilateral relations and Turkish-Armenian relations as well. Turkish historian Professor Halil Berktay, Taner Akcam, leading Turkish activist and former president of the Turkish Human Rights Association Akin Birdal, Israeli Genocide and Holocaust scholars Yair Auron, Israel W. Charny, and British historian Sir Martin Gilbert all agree that, contrary to Ankara's allegations, recognition of the Armenian Genocide will heal the wounds and release the present generation of Turks from the burden of their history, and bring about reconciliation between the Turks and Armenians. The Turks, by exploiting too the fears of Christian Turks (*) fears, which are prevalent among the minority residents of Istanbul, are coercing them to come out with declarations against the genocide resolutions. It is a known fact that all Christian Turkish institutions, like schools, hospitals, cultural associations, and churches, including even the two patriarchates (Greek and Armenian), are under strict Turkish state-controlled rules and regulations. The state controls these entities through the assignment of Turkish principals, religious affairs officials and informers recruited from among Christian Turks, to monitor the activities of the minorities in Istanbul. It is a historical fact that the list of Armenian community leaders and notables, prior to their arrest on April 24, 1915 was also prepared by Christian Turk informers and subsequently submitted to Enver and Talat Pashas. It is also known that during important Christian religious feasts and community affairs, or funeral services of Christian Turk notables, there are always informers who listen for any anti-Turkish statements, in particular during the commemoration of Nahadagatz Or (Martyrs Day) in Sisli (Shishli) Armenian Cemetery every April 24th. Naturally, most Christian Turks are unable to connect April 24th - Nahadagatz Or - with the events of 1915, or simply they have not been informed about it by their elders out of fear of being accused of defaming the Turkish state. Devlet Baba (name used by Turks to show affection and respect to the Turkish state) always has a watchful eye on its citizens who believe that the state is everywhere. OMNIPRESENT STATE SURVEILLANCE Among the Christian Turk community, it was common knowledge that one of their notable community leaders, the late Dr. S, was well known for his dual services. He used to discuss Armenian community issues, including problems involving the church and schools, with the leaders in Ankara; his requests and recommendations were readily accepted by the Turks in order to enhance his prestige among the Armenian community. For his loyalty as an informer, he benefited a great deal at the personal level also; he was able to be instrumental in dissolving some outstanding community problems. The Turkish leaders take great pride in declaring to the whole world that the Republic of Turkey is a secular state. Turkish generals, who are the real rulers of the state, maintain control over the civilian government, and they exercise their power not to give prominence to Islamic notables like muftis or imams. There are strict rules to keep religion out of politics, as we witnessed recently when the generals outlawed the Welfare Party and imprisoned its leaders, former Prime Minister Necmeddin Erbakan. One may wonder why officials in Ankara made an exception by giving prominence to the Christian Turks' Patriarch [Archbishop Mesrob Mutafyan] when they interviewed him on the CNN-Turk TV program for a discussion of Armenian issues [See text in Nov. 11, 2000 issue - ed]. Naturally the Turks used the quotations attributed to the patriarch for foreign consumption; i.e., if foreign legislatures recognize the Armenian Genocide, this would have a harmful effect on Turkish-Armenian relations. Turkish CNN-Turk correspondent Baydar, before posing any question to the patriarch, made the following statement while addressing His Beatitude Your views are important not only for Turkey but also for the whole world. If Mr. Baydar had the audacity to make the same statement to the Grand Mufti of all Turkey (leader of all Muslim Turks), he would find himself behind bars for advocating and promoting Islamic fundamentalism. Why then did the Turks give such prominence to the patriarch before the Turkish TV audience, obliging him to answer specific questions, which were particularly crafted to impress foreigners on the eve of the discussions of the Armenian Genocide Resolution in the French Senate, European and Italian Parliaments? They were giving the message that these kinds of discussions are having harmful effects on Turkish-Armenian relations. The idea is to dissuade foreign legislatures from pursuing the Armenian Genocide Resolution. EXPLOITATION OF PATRIARCH'S POSITION Mr. Baydar asked the following questions: Who will gain if the Armenian Genocide Resolution is adopted by the House of Representatives and how will this affect the Turkish-Armenian community? One should give high marks to His Beatitude Mesrob II Mutafyan for giving appropriate answers to these most delicate questions in a very prudent way and for using the correct terminology. The critics of this interview, however, are not by any means criticizing the patriarch, since no one has the right to expect a Turkish-Armenian citizen to promote the Armenian Genocide issue in a country where the people are put in jail daily for their beliefs, philosophies, and political orientation. The criticism, therefore, is directed to the Turkish officials for capitalizing on the fear of the Christian Turks in order to promote the Turkish agenda and propaganda. The Turks are the masters of manipulation. The messages that they are trying to give to the world are the following. 1) The Armenian Genocide didn't happen. 2) The Turkish-Armenian deaths were the result of civil war, there were no Ottoman government orders to massacre Armenians. 3) Historians should determine what happened in 1915, politicians have no rights to legislate historical events. 4) The pursuit of the genocide allegations will harm bilateral relations between any foreign country and Turkey, as well as Turkish Armenian relations. 5) Those pursuing the genocide allegations are fanning hatred between Turks and Armenians. 6) Armenians with alleged so-called genocide claims are aiming for financial and territorial compensation. 7) Armenians were not innocent victims either; they were waging a war of independence on Turkish territory, as attested in the memoirs of their fighters. 8) There are enough materials written about this issue as to why the Armenians are trying to legislate over and over again and conducting hostile anti-Turkish propaganda. The answer to all these accusations is simple. Armenians harbor no hatred against the Turkish people and they are not engaged in anti-Turkish propaganda. They only want condemnation of the Young Turk government for willfully perpetrating the extermination policy. The Armenians do not hold the present-day Turks responsible for those crimes; they only want recognition that such injustice and crime has been committed, in order to relieve the pain and suffering of their ancestors, the survivors and their descendants. Armenians believe that recognition will lead to a healing of wounds and scars and will establish reconciliation between Turks and Armenians. The Armenian campaign is not being pursued to disseminate hatred; on the contrary, its intent is to eliminate the burden of history hanging over succeeding generations of Turks and Armenians, which is preventing reconciliation and establishment of permanent peace. The issues and principles are the main topics for Discussion; any distortions, misinformations, false accusations and rhetoric will further inflame the situation and prevent peaceful co-existence. The Armenians will support the quest of those brave Turkish intellectuals to find the truth, as well as their efforts to establish a meaningful dialogue between Turks and Armenians.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-11-25,0
"The Consequences of the Events of 1915-1923: Destruction of the Populace and Monuments, Confiscation of the Abandoned Properties and Assimilation of the Orphans Before going into the consequences of the events of 1915-1923, it should be noted once again that the orders for the premeditated and preplanned Armenian deportations and extermination were given by the highest echelon of the Ottoman government. This is the key issue, whether the demise of the Armenians living within the Ottoman Empire was a result of interethnic communal war, as the revisionists claim, or the result of Ottoman government policy, as most credible historians argue. This space is too small to go into details. Interested persons who want to learn more about the Armenian Genocide should read the books and publications of the genocide scholar Vahakn Dadrian. However, it would be informative to present the minutes of the secret meeting of the top Ittihadists, which were circulated in a letter written Dr. Behaeddin Shakir dated February 18, 1915. The letter is long, but citing several abbreviated statements by Young Turk leaders would shed light on the irrefutable aspects of the premeditation of the Armenian Genocide. GENOCIDE PREMEDITATED Dr. Nazim: Estimable brothers, the fruit of bloodless revolution (overthrowing of the Red Sultan Abdulhamit II - MA) is unripe and bitter, and the digestion is difficult. There are constant indications of danger and revolt. I have spoken about this on many occasions. this time, taking advantage of the war, they (Armenians) reneged on their promise of remaining neutral, they have volunteered in the Russian army. (He knew that these volunteers in the Czarist army were Armenians of Russian citizenship; he intentionally refused to acknowledge the difference between Russian and Ottoman Armenians. - MA) Talat Pasha: Yes, what Dr. Nazim has said is true. Those snakes again have risen. We must deliver the final knockout. Hasan Fehmi, MP from Kastamuni: What do they want? Why don't they appreciate this era of freedom? Dr. Nazim: I will tell you what they want, Khodja Effendi, they want to destroy us. Talat Pasha: Before joining the war, we had to come to an agreement with the Armenian leaders that, in the event of war, they would remain neutral, The Armenians wouldn't aid us nor the Russians either; this protocol was accepted and endorsed at the Dashnak World Congress at Erzurum. But now they have reneged on their promise and have sent volunteers to the Russian armies. Aghaoglu Ahmed: How can the Dashnak Party represent the whole nation? The party may have made a promise in the name of a number of its members, but it does not represent the whole nation. The whole nation cannot be held responsible for such action. The Armenians in our country were drafted into the regular army in keeping with our military law and they were driven to fight against Russia. The same thing is happening on the other side, in Russia. Talat Pasha: The Dashnaks have assured us that they represent the whole nation, as we claim to represent the whole of Turkey. Kara Kemal: Armenians, in a short while you shall weep, not weep, you shall be killed. ARMENIANS ARE LIKE CANCER Dr. Nazim: The cargo ship does not run by words. Work and decisive work is needed. The Armenians are like cancer, a malignancy, which looks like a small growth from the exterior but, if is not removed by a skillful surgeon's scalpel, it will kill the patient. A good job is needed and decisive execution. The Armenian element must be severed from the roots. We must not leave a single Armenian alive in our country. We must kill the Armenian name. We are hope for. There will be no intervention of the great powers and the hue and cry of the world press will not be heard. Even so, it will be too late to do anything about it. Some perhaps will say, is it necessary to resort to such atrocities? What harm can come from the children, the oldsters and the sick? What is war? It is not savagery? I beg you, Effendis, not to surrender yourselves to such a degree of tender-heartedness. Hasan Fehmi: Yes, my Effendi, your humble servant knows this much. It is a matter of eating or being eastern. I have read it in books of natural science. Dr. Nazim: Let us think well. Why did we bring about this revolution? What was our aim? Was it to dethrone Sultan Hamid (Adulhamid II) and his men and take their places? I don't think it was for this. It was to revive Turkism that I became your comrade, brother and fellow traveler. I only want the Turks to live on these lands, let all the other elements be exterminated, no matter to what religion or faith they belong. This country must be purified from alien elements. Dr. Behaddin Shakir: When an orator like Moses, a wanderer like Jesus, an orphan like Mohammed establishes great religions in this world, why shouldn't resolute thinkers like us introduce and generalize the religion and the idealism of Turan? (geographical unity of all Turkic-speaking nations under one banner and one country - MA) Kara Kemal: May they all perish. Hasan Fehmi: The killing of all Armenians, provided not one of them shall be left alive, is a religious duty. Djavid: Now let us come to a decision. The expositions of my brothers Dr. Nazim and Dr. Behaeddin Shakir and even Hasan Fahmi have clarified sufficiently the matter. The Armenians on every occasion aligned themselves with the enemies of the Turks against the fatherland in which they lived for centuries. Against the same Turks, Effendis, who ensured the Armenians' comfort and happiness. The Turk is ruler of this country. The Turk toils in his farm under the burning sun, brings his produce to the city and sells it to the Armenian. Enriches him and ensures his happiness. The economic control is in the hands of the Armenians. At the cost of leaving not one Armenian alive, the extermination of all of them is both a national and political duty. It is equally important that the Turk shall establish his economic rule. I will now take the vote. According to Professor Shavarsh Toriguian, based on Dr. Behaeddin Shakir's minutes: At the order of Talat, the votes are collected and counted. The result was that the resolution to exterminate the Armenians, provided not a single Armenian should be left alive, was passed unanimously. PLAN IS CARRIED OUT On April 24, 1915, all prominent Armenian community leaders, intellectuals, writers, poets, members of the Ottoman Parliament, and even composers were arrested and exiled. Except for Gomidas Vartabed, all were murdered on the road to exile. Following these events, Armenians in the Eastern provinces near the war zone were all exterminated in their home towns and nearby. Armenian soldiers serving in the Ottoman army were first disarmed and coverted to labor battalions and then exterminated by their comrades under the supervision of special forces. Once the Armenian leadership was effectively eliminated, then began the deportation of the rest of the Armenians from other zones to the Syrian desert called Deir Zor. On May 16, 1915, while the extermination of the Armenians was in full swing, a law was issued containing instructions regarding the administration of movable and immovable property abandoned by the Armenian deportees were set up to prepare the lists of Armenian properties and place them under fake safe custody in the name of the deportees. Perishable goods and animals were to be sold and sums deposited in the name of the owners, all of whom were destined to die. Under phony instructions, Armenian properties were put under Ottoman State Directorate in order to exercise full central control, and proclaim later that Armenians voluntarily abandoned their own properties, lands and churches. The terminology of abandonment was meticulously used so that, over an extended period of time, allowable by the state, if the rightful owners failed to reclaim ownership, their property would revert to the state. In the meantime, the deeds and the total value of these properties were registered in special Turkish directorate, in order to take full control or deny any Armenian rights to reclaim ownership, or sell it to newly arrived Turkish refugees dislocated from the Balkans, Caucasus, and/or Arabia. The Turkification process in the eastern provinces, step by step, was in full swing. After the extermination of the Armenians, and the deportation of their remnants to the Syrian desert, followed by the willful destruction of the Armenian churches and monuments and later the sale of so-called abandoned Armenian properties to Turkish refugees, the Turkish leaders able to finalize the Armenian Genocide. POST-WAR DEVELOPMENTS After the conclusion of WWI, the treaty of Batum was signed on June 4, 1918, followed by the Treaty of Sevres signed on August 10, 1920. Both treaties had numerous provisions to return confiscated or seized Armenian-owned properties, lands and assets to their rightful owners, yet this also didn't materialize. The value of seized and confiscated properties, lands, assets, insurance policies and bank notes is hard to estimate but in 1923 it was assessed at over $4 billion. This does not include the well over four thousand churches and monuments which were destroyed and upon which a price cannot be placed. Under the newly formed Turkish Republic, a new law passed in 1923 claimed state ownership of properties and lands of Armenians no longer living in Turkey, regardless of the reason or the circumstances of their abandonment. This concluded and affirmed the policy of their predecessors, the Young Turks; namely, purification of Anatolia from foreign elements, and Turkey for the Turks only. As a prelude to the imposition of the capital tax on minorities, in his opening speech at Milli Medjlis on November 1, 1942, President Ismet Inonu stated: It is about time to get rid of those elements (Armenians, Greeks and Jews) controlling the business and enterprises and sucking the blood of Turks. He advocated transformation of the business and enterprise ownership from non-Muslims to Muslims, thus enabling Turks to control their own destiny, financially and institutionally as well. Thus, the capital tax took away what was left from the once prosperous minority population. This illustrates that denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Ottoman successor state, Turkish Republic, is not accidental or due to emotional reasons or pride; it is, by design, the affirmation and continuation of the Young Turks' policy. Dr. Ayhan Aktar, of the Political Science Faculty of Marmar University, in his essay in the September 1999 issue of Toplusmsal Tarih (Social or Societal History), discusses the reasons and motivations behind the Capital Tax of December 26, 1942-June 30, 1943. The same issue of Toplumsal Tarih reviews the case of WWI orphans - Savas Yetimleri ve Kisesiz Cocuklar: Ermeni mi Turke mu? (The war orphans and children without parents: are they Armenian or Turk by extraction?). The author, Yavuz Selim Karakisla, confesses that the orphans of the Armenian deportee victims, who were brought to Istanbul during the armistice, were placed under the auspices of the missionaries. Special commissions where also set up to conduct a selection process to identify the orphans' ethnic background. Those under the age of four and unable to remember their past were identified either by their facial features and declared Armenian or were given to Muslim-Turk families for adoption or assimilation, like at the time of Janissaries. FOUR PHASES OF ARMENIAN GENOCIDE The following are the four different phases of the Armenian Genocide. 1) The Deportation and Extermination of the Armenian Population, 2) Confiscation and Seizure of the so-called Abandoned Armenian Properties, 3) Destruction of the Armenian Churches and Monuments, 4) Denial and Distortion of the historical realities, and accusing the victims of committing atrocities against Turks. Fabrication of the so-called civil war scenario in order to cover up the premeditated feature of the crime by the perpetrators. Now there are new attempts to distract the victims. This is manifested with calls to get Armenian, Turkish and foreign historians to study the 1915-1923 events impartially, and to leave the issue to the historians with intent to eliminate the political aspects of the genocidal act. Enormous pressures on foreign governments, including the US, France, Italy and others, reflect the Turks' concern that any recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the Western governments will open Pandora's box and, in turn, Armenians will ask for restitution and restoration of lands, properties and assets. The opening of the Armenian Genocide Museum in our nation's capital is the first step to fight against revisionism and injustice, and for restoration of the rights of the victims and their heirs to seized properties and lands.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-11-18,0
"Diary of A Pilgrim - Pilgrimage to the Holy Land Since childhood I have read and heard numerous stories about pilgrimages to Jerusalem. I have listened with awe to eyewitness accounts of pilgrims about the Holy Land, but never did I grasp their excitement until I personally walked on the cobble-stoned streets of old Jerusalem. I had always thought that a pilgrimage would be an inspiring experience for a Christian. It would be exciting to walk in the city that the prophet Jeremiah called the Lord's Throne (Jer. 3:17). The city of Peace where God has put his name. I will put my name in Jerusalem (II King 21:4). A city around which King Solomon erected solid walls (Neh. 2:17). A city with seven gates and Mount Zion where God resides (Joel 3:17) and Mount Moriah where God appeared to the prophet Solomon built a magnificent Temple (II Chron., 3:1). Jerusalem the blessed was adored and worshipped by the Psalmist. He vowed never to forget Jerusalem. If I forget you, O Jerusalem, may my right hand wither, may my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth if I do not remember you, if I do not consider Jerusalem my highest joy (Ps. 137:506). Jerusalem the cradle of peace where Isaiah invited many generations to come and rejoice with her (Is. 66:10) and find comfort in her bosom. As a mother comforts her child, so will I comfort you, and you will be comforted over Jerusalem. (Is. 66:13-14). Jerusalem, this city sanctified by the crucifixion of our Lord, with her seven gates wide open, is an everlasting invitation to Christendom to come and enjoy the house of God and sing with the Psalmist. How lovely is your dwelling place, O Lord Almighty! My soul yearns, even faints, for the court of the Lord;...I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than dwell in the Tents of the wicked. (Ps. 84:1-2,4). With these biblical in mind, my Yeretzgin and I begin our pilgrimage to Jerusalem with a group of Datevatzi seminarians. On Monday evening, July 10, we fly through Paris and arrive at Amman Airport. We are met by our guide, Very Reverend Avedis Iprakjian, a member of the St. James brotherhood. He is a very enthusiastic and vibrant young clergyman and greets us warmly. We forget our hardships and with an air-conditioned bus set out on our journey to Jerusalem. Passing through the 10,000-year-old city of Jericho at midnight, we enter into the holy city. Like a schoolboy who has memorized his lines, I repeat in my mind with faith and excitement these lines from Psalms: I rejoiced with those who said to me, 'let us go to the house of the Lord.' Our feet are standing in your gates, O Jerusalem (Ps. 122:1-2). The bus stops at Notre Dame Hotel. A huge statue of our Lady the Mother of God at the top of the hotel embraces us in the darkness of the night and we all fall into a deep sleep in her bosom. JULY 11 Our first visit was naturally to the St. James Armenian monastery complex in the heart of the Old City. From our hotel we walk to New Gate, and through the crawling narrow streets and covered markets we make our way to St. James. As an Armenian I feel proud that a handful of Armenians has been in possession of this complex, where the most dominant structure is the cathedral, a church of hundreds of lanterns and magnificent paintings. This church was built on the relic of the head of St. James, the brother of Christ. This was the house of St. James, the first bishop of Christians. It was here that the first apostolic meeting was held. The Jews later be-headed St. James for his Christian beliefs. The place of his execution became a shrine in later years, and Armenians somehow inherited it, built a chapel on the shrine and enclosed the chapel in St. James Cathedral. The relic of his head was buried under the throne of the Patriarch but later was buried under the main altar. In the Cathedral is also St. Stephen's chapel, under whose altar is buried the baptismal font of St. Cyril of Jerusalem. The actual chains of Patriarch Krikor the Chain Bearer are kept here as well. He was the savior of the Armenian quarter. During his reign (1715-1749), when the Patriarchate was subdued by heavy taxation and debt and was deemed confiscated by its creditors, this Patriarch placed chains around his neck and visited all Armenian communities in the world to raise money for the St. James monastery. He vowed not to remove the chains until he had met his fundraising goal. Ultimately he raised more than he had expected, saved the Armenian quarter, and made many renovations as well. Our guide, Father Avedis, who was holding these chains in his hand, approached me and said jokingly; Der Nerses, why don't you wear the chains around your neck? I put them on. They were heavy. Then I thought that all Armenian Christians should metaphorically feel the weight of chains around their necks as a reminder and a commitment to protect the Armenian properties of Jerusalem. On the left wall of St. James Cathedral is another chapel called St. Etchmiadzin. Blue ceramic tiles from Kutahia adorn the walls of St. James. The Cathedral has twenty-five altars and on the right wall an ornate balcony where readings and the sermon are delivered. The church is dark and very mystical. It smells of prayer. Hundreds of years of prayers saturate and strengthen the walls. The spirits of the pilgrims of each century are present. Many have hung their jewelry on the paintings as prayers for causes dear to them. The church has no pews. Beautiful Persian carpets cover the entire floor. I start walking towards the altar, but it seems to me that my feet do not touch ground. I kiss first the shrine where St. James was be-headed and then find myself in front of the main altar. My heart overflows with a fountain of prayer. I pray for my deceased relatives and parishioners. I ask healing for all my sick parishioners. And suddenly I remember that, in 1963, my late mother brought my youngest brother to Jerusalem to have him baptized. And now, as in olden days, once again my mother and I pray together hand in hand. We lit our candles, and after hanging our prayers from the lanterns, we visit one by one all the institutions in the St. James monastery compound. The museum, Tarkmanchatz School, Holy Archangels Church, the manuscript library of St. Theodoros Church, the bookstore, etc. We were told that at one time 10,000 Armenians lived on this complex. Now there are scarcely 1000 Armenians left. We leave St. James and walk around the great walls of the city. Then Father Avedis leads us to the valley of Gihon, a deep valley, at the bottom of which is the water tunnel of Ezekiel. Most of the seminarians venture to walk through this dark tunnel. After the adventure, we visited first the The Wailing Wall and then the Via Dolorosa, the path over which Jesus dragged his cross. There are fourteen stations. I must admit that I had some difficulty comprehending the sacredness of the place, because the path of the cross is a dirty and noisy bazaar. Then I came around to thinking that perhaps it was best that no one has tried to change anything here. After all, the Via Dolorosa we know from the Gospels was full of people who hated Jesus, and that very same street is still full of people who reject him, Muslim and Jewish shopkeepers. At the fourth station I stop for a while and try to visualize our Lord walking under the weight of his cross through the throng of hatred. Like a ray of light he walked through darkness, sowing love on the field of hatred. On these same streets, we, the Datevatzi pilgrims, gather up some of his love and walk with our Lord as new Simons of Cyrene and climb with him to Golgotha. The Cathedral of the Holy Sepulcher is a magnificent edifice. It is not a church, but a little village. Under its roof are enclosed areas related to the episodes of the Trial, Tortures, Crucifixion and Burial. We visit first the prison of Jesus, where he was held briefly after his conviction. Then we go to the place where the Roman soldiers divided his tunic amongst themselves. The altar belongs to Armenians. From there we ascend to Golgotha, which is a huge rock. The altar once belonged to Armenians but later became the property of the Greek Patriarchate. Under this rock they say is the tomb of Adam and Eve. From there we visit the place where Joseph of Arimathea laid the body of Jesus and wrapped it in the linen shroud. Then, one by one, we enter into the empty tomb of our Lord. We kiss the tomb where the Christian religion was born. I am kneeling now by the tomb and feel the flow of inexplicable energy and spiritual excitement. The spirits of my parents and other family members and the souls of my deceased parishioners kneel by my side. I light a candle and walk out. Standing a few feet from the tomb like the dumb struck women on the morning of resurrection, I try to immerse myself in the mystery of the resurrection. In the Cathedral, Armenians have an upper room with a marble altar. They call this place the second Golgotha, because it is across from the original Golgotha and belongs exclusively to Armenians. At the bottom of the stairs to this upper room, on the spot where people believe that St. Mary fainted under the shock of her son's crucifixion, Armenians have built a wonderful and welcoming altar with Armenian inscriptions around it. After this uplifting and exhilarating experience, we return to the hotel. That same night, at 8:30 p.m., we had the honor to be the guests of the Armenian Patriarch, His Beatitude, Archbishop Torkom Manoogian. He received us in the magnificent official hall of the patriarchate, which was very ornate and majestic. His Beatitude extended warm welcoming words to us, gave us each a little souvenir, and graciously agreed to pose with us for a group picture. JULY 12 Our destination is Bethlehem (The House of Bread), a half-hour drive from Jerusalem. The hills are covered with olive trees. The population here is entirely Muslim, and the city is under Palestinian rule. From the parking lot we walk about ten minutes through streets full of the smell of Arabic food. Vendors on the pavement sell almost everything, and young lads swarm around us, competing to sell souvenir cards. We are already in shepherds' field, where the angels appeared to the shepherds and heralded the good news of Christmas. We enter into the shepherds' cave and joyously sing the hymn of the angels; Glory to God in the highest. From there we walk to the Milk Grotto, the place where the Holy Family found temporary refuge on their way to Egypt at the time of the massacre of the Holy Innocents. In this grotto, it is said that while St. Mary was breastfeeding her child, a drop of milk fell to the floor. I remember the following lines of St. Nareg's prayer: Here is a drop of your virginal milk, raining on me and giving me life (Nareg 80). It is a very pleasant church whose walls are decorated with paintings in soft colors; depicting scenes from the flight into Egypt. Standing there, I visualize the terror-stricken faces of St. Mary and St. Joseph. Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under. (Matt. 2:16) Most probably the streets were filled with lamentation and terror. In the grotto. St. Mary held her child tightly to her chest, praying that the soldiers would not find their hiding place. From the Milk Grotto we walk through narrow streets and find ourselves in the courtyard of the Bethlehem Cathedral. The Armenian belfry embraces us. And on the top of the entrance the Armenian star, built in 1930, lights Christmas lights in our hearts. The entrance to the cathedral is so low that you almost have to kneel to enter. We enter the narthex, and recite to myself from the Gospel of Luke; For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. (Luke 2:11). We are here then to see our newly born savior. We are here to eat spiritual bread in this house of Bread, Bethlehem. The cathedral was built in the 4th century. The main altar belongs to the Greeks. On the right side of the cathedral, the Armenians have their own altar. We start our descent to the cave where Jesus was born. It is our good fortune that an Armenian mass is in progress. We join our 26 strong voices to the voices of two monks, Father Razmig, the Rector of Bethlehem, and Father Nerses. Seeing us, they too are pleased. In this dark and humid cave we sing with all our souls and bodies and wish that it would never end. The moment is simply majestic. There, on the left, is the actual manger where the baby Jesus was placed. The orange flames of the candles create an exceptional religious ambiance. I didn't know what to do to capture this moment - take a picture, kiss the manager, or pray? We were as happy and excited as children on Christmas morning. In this cave time is frozen. I remember the lines of the Armenian Christmas hymn, Great Mystery and Wondrous. (Khorhoort Medz Yev Skanchelee). At the end of the mass we receive communion and a little portion of holy bread, which I kept in my wallet to feed myself each day. We climb back up to the cathedral and visit the school of St. Jerome in the Armenian section, where he translated the Bible into Latin (known today as the Vulgate Version). He was buried in the courtyard. In the 16th century, the Vatican moved his remains to Rome. In the reception hall of the Armenian convent, Father Razmig gives us refreshments and coffee and offers us little goblets full of Bethlehem blessed oil. With the oil in our bags and the Baby Jesus in our hearts, we board the bus and head to Mount Zion. The first place we visit is the Church of Dormition where St. Mary passed away. On this location the Latins have built a magnificent cathedral with dazzling mosaics ornamenting the walls. Here we sing yet another hymn dedicated to St. Mary, We prostrate before thee. Our voices fill the cathedral as curious tourists stand transfixed and enjoy our strange hymn. We descend to the actual place of Dormition in the basement of the cathedral. We put a handful of prayers and supplications on the lap of our Lady and sister, the Virgin Mary, and step to the upper room of Pentecost, where the Holy Spirit descended with fiery tongues upon the apostles. We sing a few verses of the Pentecostal hymn and descend to the street as new apostles of our time. The Armenian cemetery, Holy Savior, is in walking distance, a very old cemetery indeed. In it are the tombs of patriarchs and monks and lay people. We are told that, at one time, a secret tunnel linked the cemetery to the St. James monastery, and that the resident Chief Priest Caiaphas was in the vicinity where Jesus was tried for the second time. And, according to Father Avedis, the lid of Jesus' tomb is buried under the altar of the cemetery chapel. From there we walk around the walls of St. James and to the Holy Archangels Church to attend an evening service. It is a very welcoming and mystical church. It was the house of the chief priest Annas where the first trial of Jesus took place. The church is rich with magnificent paintings by the artist Deacon Hanna who also wrote the history of Armenian Jerusalem. Kutahian blue ceramic tiles decorate the walls of this church as well. This church was once called the Monastery of the Olive because the olive three where Jesus was tied and tortured after his conviction is still in the courtyard. While the monks and seminarians conduct the evening service, I remember my seminarian days and mingle my voice with theirs in this church of Archangels. JULY 13 Our destination is Lake Tiberias or the Sea of Galilee. The bus crawls through Jericho and stops at the foot of the Mount of Temptation. It is a very rugged and dry mountain. There is no sign of life. It is completely barren. On the top of the mountain are the huts of hermits. It is a very warm day. It seems to me that the entire mountain is a thirsty land waiting for heaven's downpour. It is a natural place for self-denial and repentance where Jesus spent forty hungry and thirsty days before beginning his ministry. But we, at this early hour of the morning, stand holding bottles of cold water in contrast to the suffering of Jesus in this barren place. Think to myself, it is so blessed that Jesus did not succumb to the temptations of Satan; otherwise we would be wandering in a spiritual wilderness. We continue our journey towards Nazareth where the holy family lived. In the heat of midday we arrive at Nazareth and head towards the Cathedral of the Annunciation adjacent to which Muslims are trying to erect a mosque. In this cathedral is the carpentry workshop of St. Joseph and next to it the actual house (a dark cave) where Jesus was raised. From there we walk to the Church of the Well of St. Mary. It is the well to which St. Mary came to draw water right before the Annunciation. The actual well is still there. The Greeks built a shrine and enclosed it in a huge church. Our next stop is the village of Cana where Jesus performed his first miracle, turning the water into wine. (John 2) On the location of the house, the Latins have built a church with dazzling mosaics and placed six jars on the walls to remind visitors of the miracle. Our bus cruises through the beautiful and green hills of Gennesaret and descends to the Sea of Galilee 700 feet below sea level. We embark on an excursion boat and have a joyful trip on the sea that our Lord and his disciples so often frequented. Under the canopy of the boat we rest and sing hymns. Small waves hit the bow of the ship and bring with them the echo of Jesus's voice, saying, It is I, do not be afraid. I think that we humans are still like the frightened and doubtful Peter when it comes to walking on the stormy sea of our lives. After an hour's ride we disembark in Capermaum and eat St. Peter's fish in a restaurant. After lunch we enter Capermaum and from there to Bethsaida, the birthplace of St. Peter, St. Andrew and St. Matthew. We visit the house of Peter, the house of his in-law where Jesus performed another miracle. Afterwards a few of us venture to walk into Galilee and wash ourselves. I picked up a few pebbles, and now they are on my desk at home. I look at them as often as I sit there to write an article or speech or a sermon and try to hear Jesus' encouraging words, It is I, do not be afraid. We enter the village of Tabgha where the miraculous feeding of the five thousand took place. At the edge of the village there is a retreat house overlooking the sea. In the courtyard the German owners have built a tent with bamboo and set up a few tree trunks as pews. At the center there is a large flat rock that serves as an altar and an iron cross is nailed onto the rock. This is the simplest and most beautiful church I have ever seen. With the cool breeze in my face, spontaneously I start singing the communion hymn, Vor Gazmetzer. The seminarians respond with other hymns of the Holy Mass. The place is so exalting to the spirit that I repeat St. Peter's words at the Transfiguration, Lord, it is good for us to be here (Matt. 17:14). JULY 14 We are in the village of Bethany, where Jesus's friend Lazarus lived with his sisters Mary and Martha. On the narrow and dusty streets I try to hear echoes of the crowd's wondrous exclamation after the resurrection of Lazarus. Some of us descend to Lazarus's tomb and from thence we enter the church of St. Lazarus, enjoy the mosaics, and sing our hymns. We take Lazarus with us and head toward the Dead Sea. On the way we pass the mountain of Qumran where a shepherd found centuries-old biblical scrolls. Our guide, Father Avedis, tells us the following story about the shepherd. When the Arab shepherd was searching for his lost sheep, he entered into a cave and found a jar full of old scrolls. He took one out, brought it to Bethlehem, and tried to sell it to an Armenian monk offered him one dinar, the shepherd refused, and made the same offer to an Assyrian monk. This monk offered him five, instead of two, and promised him 1000 dinar if he revealed the location of the jar. The next day the Assyrian monk was in the cave. He took the scrolls, smuggled them gradually out of the country, and sold them for millions of dollars. Armenian stupidity, I think, and we continue our journey towards the Dead Sea. The Sea is 394 meters below sea level. It is really dead. It has no life in it and no promise of life. It is itself gradually dying as millions of gallons of water evaporate daily. We eat lunch in a restaurant and take the cable car to the Peak of Massada Mountain where King Herod had his summer home. According to historians, the Roman army encircled the place for months, made their way to the top of this steep mountain, and finally captured the fortress. The Israelite soldiers, at the last minute, committed suicide rather than witness the Roman victory. It is so hot up here that you cannot think about anything but cold water. We descend and spend an hour at the shore of the Dead Sea. On the way back to the hotel, we stop at the Mount of Olives from whence our Lord ascended to heaven forty days after his resurrection. The place is very windy. We cool off a little and enjoy a camel ride. JULY 15 Today is Saturday. We are planning to spend our day mostly in religious activities. In the morning we are in St. James Cathedral to attend a Badarak celebrated by our leader, Father Anoushavan Tanielian. The Mass was celebrated in the chapel of St. James on the spot where he was beheaded. The moment is sweet, the mass is different. It is our own. Everything is ours: the lanterns, the columns, the candelabras, the church music, and even the voices that fill the cathedral. A few monks and St. James seminarians and our boys and girls are the only attendants. The saints of the paintings descend and join us in singing. The voice of the celebrant pierces the air and grows louder and louder, echoing in the air. Peace to all. I pray that peace be in this city where every day the sons of Abraham hate each other fiercely. Peace be on this city of Peace where even the Christians beat each other up to protect their rights. At the end of Badarak I pick up a wafer for my church in Philadelphia to grace the life of my parish with the perpetual blessing of the Holy Land. That wafer is now in the Tabernacle of our Altar next to the wafer I had brought two years ago from Etchmiadzin. After the Badarak we were given a few hours for shopping in the narrow souks of Jerusalem. At 5 p.m. in the evening we were to experience yet another exalting religious service, the traditional procession in the cathedral of the Holy Sepulcher. The procession began in the Armenian Quarter, headed by Hayr Anoushavan. With hymns and incense we proceed first to the prison where Jesus was held briefly before his crucifixion. Next we go to the spot where the Roman soldiers divided his tunic among themselves and then to Golgotha, the scene of the crucifixion. Our procession continues to the place where Joseph of Aremathia prepared the body of our Lord for burial and then to the Tomb of Jesus. Here, thanks to Hayr Avedis, we have a second chance to enter the tomb and light our candles. Illuminated with the mystery of the empty tomb, we step out. JULY 16 This is the last day of our trip. It being Sunday, we awaken to a magnificent symphony of church bells. We are given permission to celebrate our own mass in the church of St. Mary, built on her tomb. The church is at the edge of the Garden of Gethsemane and belongs to the Armenians. The celebrant is Der Antranig Baljian and his son and helper, Deacon Nshan. We Datevatzis are both the choir and congregation. In this deep cave, illuminated by the orange flames of candles, we sing with such vigor that I wonder what is filling us with such energy. Is it the empty tomb of St. Mary behind the altar or the magnificent paintings of the saints on the walls? For every good and perfect gift is from above. With these closing words of the celebrant, our pilgrimage comes to an end. I stroll in the Garden of Gethsemane and meditate about this week. It flew by so quickly. I hear Hayr Avedis's commanding voice Are you ready, boys and girls? Who could be ready to bid farewell to these holy places, I think. After a week we have just begun to awaken from our dream, to start touching reality and to digest the sacredness of the places we have visited. How can we leave Armenian Jerusalem when each Armenian monk and Armenian holy place is so much in need of Armenian people? The Armenian population has decreased tremendously in this holy city. For the protection of the Armenian holy places, the Patriarch Krikor the Chain Bearer wore chains around his neck. But our return is inevitable. Pilgrims come and go. Tens of thousands, if not millions, of Armenians have come and gone. It is our turn now. With the images of the shrines ingrained in our memories, rejuvenated by the blessedness of the Holy Land, and like good pilgrims carrying candles and incense in our bags, we return home to be called Hajii.","Manoogian, Nerses",Armenian Reporter International,2000-11-04,0
"Let Us Defend What Is Ours During the course of the Karabagh movement, it became clear - and it was openly admitted in Armenia - that Azerbaijan did a better job than we Armenians in the realm of propaganda and came out ahead. We have always had the wrong mentality, saying that the world knows that we are just or right in this or that matter, and nobody will believe the lies spread by the Turks. On the contrary, a lie (even the smallest) must be immediately countered and the truth brought forth; in this regard, nothing is insignificant or unimportant. We should learn from our enemies. We should have a clear position in the Armenian-Turkish controversy. While we argue about having a national ideology, the Azeris are operating in the practical sphere of everyday life. In the last century, particularly during the 70 years of Soviet rule, while we were idealists devoted to the noble ideals of communism, the Azeris and Turks of Azerbaijan had Karabagh and Nakhichevan. Through methods unique to them, they gradually took small expanses of land from Soviet Armenia. Armenia was full of Azeris; with the exception of Yerevan and Leninakan, they constituted 35-90 percent of the population in all other regions. At the directive of the Muslim leader, who had practically become the imam for the Muslim population of the Soviet Union (the main Russian press, including Izvestia, wrote about this), mollahs roamed through the villages of Armenia and made it obligatory on the Azeris (even threatening them) to have at least 10 children (for further details, read Zori Balayan's Ojakh, Yerevan: Sovetaken Grogh, 1981). In 1946, in connection with the repatriation movement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan agreed to relocate the Azeris of Ararat plain to Azerbaijan. Those Azeris did so, taking with them the property of the Kolhoz (collective farm) - animals, tractors, etc. But, one or two years later, they returned, without bringing back what they had taken and, furthermore, complicating the problem of the settlement of the repatriates too. During the late 1980's and early 1990's, when the Russian sectarians, called Molokans, left the northern regions of Armenia en masse, the Azeris took possession of their homes. It wasn't for no reason that, following the Sumgait massacre, a rumor circulated in Armenia to the effect that Aliev (the leader of Nakhichevan at the time) had told the Azeri leader Vezirov that the Sumgait massacre had been unnecessary, that if he had waited 20-25 years, the Armenians would be a minority in their own country of Armenia by that time, and Azerbaijan would achieve its goal. That was their steady policy. Let's recall other insignificant developments. During the past two decades, Baku radio broadcast Armenian popular songs in the Azeri language, only to subsequently say that we Armenians have borrowed their songs. In place of our Armenian place names, they were putting Turkish names (in Armenia and Karabagh alike) and then announcing that they have been Turkish all along. For example, they call Sevan Lake Geokcha, which they had considered their lake. In recent years, Azeri historians proved that the Armenians came to Karabagh 150 years ago when Armenia was annexed to Russia and, moreover, that they had created khachkars (which they call khachdash) even before the Urartian period but that the Armenians had forcibly Christianized them. They consider the name Karabagh theirs, translating it as black garden. Meanwhile, as early as the 2nd century BC, the Greek historian Ptolemy had used the name Karabala; in the Ashkharatsuits [World Map] of the 7th century Armenian scientist Anania of Shirak, there is the name Baghk or Baghats ashkharh parallel with the name Artsakh. Other names derived from the root word bagha (or bala) are Palou, Palahovid and other place names. The ghara or kara particle (derived from the root word bagha) in the Indo-European languages meant army, troops or tribe (The name Garabed is derived from this, meaning tribal leader or troop commander). The name Karabagh arose during the period when the princes of Baghk ruled over Artsakh (Artur Navasardian, Gharabagh Deghanvan Shurje [Concerning the Place Name Karabagh], Nor Giank, No. 49, 1998). The rugs of Karabagh were sold as Azerbaijani rugs in the Soviet Union. However, I recently learned that the German art historian and scholar Volkmar Gantzhorn, in his book entitled The Christian Oriental Carpet (Colon, Germany, 1991, English translation by Charles Madsen), has proved that even Persian, Indian, Chinese and European rugs and rug making, generally speaking, originated in Armenia (Korkuh Yerchangutiun Guh Pere [Rugs Bring Happiness], Nor Giank, No. 48, 1999). An unknown Arab geographer of the 10th century referred to the rugs of the city of Karin (now Erzerum) as kali (karin), from which derived the word Khali used by the Arabs (and Turks). (Ruzan Nshanian, Haikakan Avandakan Arhesdnere [Traditional Armenian Trades]. Bnorran, Nos.1-2, 1999). The Americans appropriated our word carpet but they never said that they were the creators of carpets. The final example is the world yogurt which is used again in America (now in Russia too). The Turks also use this word as a Turkish word. They consider the Armenian word madzoon as the Armenian equivalent of yogurt. In reality, the word yogurt or yogurt is made up of the Armenian root word yugh (fat) and the suffix ort (as in loghort, vorsort, etc.). Since ancient times, the Armenians have churned madzoon or yoghurt to make butter (yogh). The word underwent a phonetic transformation in the mouths of Turks, and yoghort became yogurt. At the present time, when the Turks are trying to prove every which way that they did not originate elsewhere but are indigenous to the region, that the tribes making up the Armenian people prior to Urartu were Turks, etc., it is extremely important that we know and def end what we have created, what originated from us and was spread by us, our nomenclature, in order to counter against the Turks.","Vorberyan, Nshan",Armenian Reporter International,2000-10-21,0
"Another, Most Fulfilling Pilgrimage Some experiences are like cornerstones. In July of this year, eighteen of us went on a pilgrimage to the ancient monasteries of Vaspouragan in northern Iran. The occasion was the 1700th anniversary of the Church of Armenia. The Eastern Prelacy sponsored the trip, and Vasken Ghougassian, Ph.D, organized everything and guided us. Vasken is executive director of the Armenian Prelacy in New York. He is a foremost expert on the history of Armenians and the Church in Iran. He is the author of The Emergence of the Armenian Diocese of New Julfa in the Seventeenth Century (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998). This is a well-written document, easy to read and literally well documented - with eye-popping, saucy material illustrating the unseemly growing pains of the Church of Armenia. The book is a must-read. It made our exploration of the rich history of New Julfa so much more meaningful. SHAH ABBAS AND THE JUGHATSIS In 1603, Shah Abbas kidnapped 3-400,000 Armenians from the Yerevan and Nakhichevan regions, and had them displaced deep inside Iran, walking. Of course, most died on the way. Today's Iranian-Armenians are mostly their descendants. The Shah wanted skills and cheap labor. He got that and much more: access to international markets and wealth, thanks to the inhabitants of a small town called Julfa in Nakhichevan, by the river Arax. In Armenian, it's Jugha. Jughatsis were extraordinary traders, and they practically owned the silk trade between Europe and India. They were very, very wealthy. The Shah brought the Jughatsis to his capital, Esfahan - 1,500 kilometers south of their original home. First, he methodically destroyed Julfa, so they would not even dream of returning there. Then he embarked on operation please the Jughatsis, so they would consider Iran their permanent home. He directed them to build their own town and to make their churches and homes as beautiful as they wished. He gave them land and ordered his people to tolerate their infidel ways. In a manic zeal, he also ordered the transfer of...the Cathedral of Etchmiadzin to Esfahan, stone by stone. The Jughatsis talked him out of that madness - but not before several stones were actually imported. Local people - including Muslims - now believe the Etchmiadzin stones can miraculously confer fertility to those who touch them. The displaced Jughatsis called their new town New Julfa, quite appropriately. They had a knack for fine things and they sponsored religious art. They built awe-inspiring, richly decorated churches, which we visited in amazement. Some are painted a la Sistine Chapel. We visited one of their homes, restored under Empress Farah and currently a national historic site. New Jughatsis were smart, well traveled and very sophisticated. But they were not always wise, nor were they always concerned with the fate of fellow Armenians. Some converted to Islam in order to have legal advantage in Islamic courts. Others were unusually arrogant. Khawaja Bedros agreed to show the Shah that he, Bedros, was wealthier - and he proved it. The Shah agreed that Bedros won, but he took away all his wealth and reduced the Khawaja to poverty. Undaunted, he settled in India where he built another fortune. But he did not forget his New Jugha: he sent money to build yet the most beautiful church there. By and large, New Jughatsis were staunch supporters of Etchmiadzin. They gave catholic missionaries a run for their money, making it inevitable that they ultimately fold out of Iran. Catholicoi tried to control the wealth of the Armenian Khawajas, but did not succeed. Several catholicoi came from New Julfa in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1722, the Afghans destroyed the Safavid dynasty and pillaged everything. Most of the Armenian traders moved to Europe, India and the Far East, where they continued to amass wealth. THE OTHER IRANIAN-ARMENIANS Not all deportees were fortunate like the Jughatsis. Most experienced hardships and lived in shabby conditions. Many got assimilated by Islam. Incidentally, Iranian names ending with ian are not necessarily islamized Armenian names. Apparently, the ending was characteristic of Zoroastrian names; Persian-Zoroastrians who converted to Islam dropped the ending, but many didn't. On the other hand, when Armenians-Zoroastrians became Christian, most kept the ian. Most Armenians maintained their identity and stayed staunchly affiliated with the Church. They never stopped speaking Armenian, unlike Armenians of Ottoman Turkey, who gave up the language for Turkish. Not only that, but they retained some linguistic characteristics that Armenians elsewhere lost altogether. For example, they pronounce R in both soft and hard forms - just like originally intended - and it is easy to notice. Iranian-Armenians did not experience the Genocide. Their growth was relatively unimpeded for about three hundred years. Today, they are viewed by their government and fellow Muslim citizens as model, productive citizens. The high caliber of Iranian-Armenians in America says tons about their excellent formation back home. Armenians in Iran are like an island in a sea of Islamic tolerance. Theocratic governments incorporate differences of religion and custom into laws that institutionalize separation. As a result, Iranian-Armenians live almost exclusively within their heritage, their churches and community centers in Iran. There is no melting pot there. The Khomeini period may have been difficult, but this resourceful and adaptive community survived in style. Today, Armenians schools are packed with students. Only Christian Armenians can attend, and they get a full religious education, all in Armenian. Perhaps in order to project an image of tolerance, but largely because of actual admiration, Iranians have high respect for Armenians' places of worship. The government devotes large resources to build and maintain roads that make distant monastries accessible to Armenian pilgrims. The average tourist brochure is likely to display pictures of mosques, followed by at least one Armenian Church - often the second set of pictures, or even the picture on the back page. Yet, Armenians are less than 1% of the population. THE CATHOLICATE OF CILICIA IN IRAN The Armenian Church was historically under the jurisdiction of Etchmiadzin. The Church had a foothold in that territory much before Shah Abbas came into the life of Armenians. After the deportations of 1603, two dioceses were established, each with a primate. In 1946, the Armenian population of Tehran having grown tremendously, a third diocese was started there. In 1949, Shah Mohammad Rezza Pahlavi accused the dioceses of Julfa and Tehran of being centers for Soviet espionage, and closed them down. He kicked two prelate out of the country and forbade clergy from outside Iran to step foot in Iran. In practice, the Shah made it so no clergy affiliated with Etchmiadzin could qualify for hierarchical or administrative functions. For more than 10 years, there was no religious leadership in Tehran and Esfahan. The Diocese of Tabriz continued with its prelate, but he remained incommunicado with Etchmiadzin. After 1960, the Catholicate of Cilicia took over all three orphaned dioceses and gave the community a jump start. The Catholicate was allowed in Iran because of her total independence from Etchmiadzin and her declared anti-Soviet stand. The momentous impact of the Catholicate of Cilicia on the Armenian community is easy to see at every turn. Everywhere, the names of Prelate Karekin Sarkissian (later, Prelate of New York, Catholicos of Cilicia and Catholicos of All Armenian) and his followers are repeated with reverence and gratitude. The Republic of Armenia enjoys excellent relations with Iran, largely thanks to the functional and cordial relations of Antelias with the theocratic government of Iran. Harmony started during the days of Prelate Karekin Sarkissian of Esfahan, during the days of the Shah. His personal relations with Iran's Islamic clergy was aptly nurtured by other prelates. It all paid off exponentially. ARMENIAN NATIONALISM AND THE END OF AN ERA Iranian-Armenians are very, very nationalistic. They actively groom an ARF-brand Armenianism, and the Anti-ARF Symphony Orchestra, as we know it, has no clout there. The pro-Western policies of the Shah, the anticommunist bias of Islam made it impossible for sympathizers of the Soviets to have a say-so in Iran. The ARF were naturals for Iranian governments. The preservation of Armenian traditions in almost intact form for almost 400 years is amazing. There is extraordinary depth and energy in this community. Their creativity and success are some of the most precious treasures of the nation. However, people are leaving Iran in droves. The youth can't wait to get out; you can see it in their sparkling eyes. They feel constrained, they want to westernize, they want to expand. A way of life may be on the verge of extinction. Like Calcutta and perhaps Jerusalem, the Armenian cultural treasures and artifacts of Iran may be at risk. Will there be enough Armenians to own them, in the future? AWE AND INSPIRATION We visited beautiful churches in Tehran and New Julfa, as well as a very old church in Shiraz. We will never forget the monasteries of Dzor-Dzor, St. Stepanos and St. Thadde, north, in historical Armenian Vaspouragan. We admired the work of Land and Culture. We drove along the Arax River, and across, we saw the Khatchkars of Old Julfa, Nakhichevan. The Azeris bulldozed most of them, but international outrage brought that to a full stop. The forest of Khatchkars we saw was big enough to bring us to tears. We also witnessed paranoid Azeri border-guarding. We saw Mount Ararat from the other side. Five thousand Iranian-Armenian pilgrims drove to distant, semi-arid mountains, so they could reaffirm their faith and renew their commitment to their religious heritage. They created a heartwarming, festive atmosphere - complete with colorful tents, peddlers, joyful singing, poetry, shish kebab and plenty of good will. His Holiness Catholicos Aram I was the highlight of the pilgrimage. He was in the local news, always treated with reverence. He was received like a head of state because, in a theocracy, the highest-ranking clergyman is the nation's leader. The Catholicos came as a pilgrim. He officiated in all three monasteries of Vaspouragan. His sermons were outstanding. Unquestionably, he commands a refines, polished oration. He may well be unequaled by any living Armenian clergyman. The experience was deeply satisfying, and it brought us in touch with our essence. This was a most fulfilling pilgrimage. We are blessed: earlier this year, the Diocese took us to Jerusalem; this time, it was the Prelacy. To boot, we had pure, unadulterated fun. The ladies endured scorching 95-degree heat while dressed up in Islamic-code covers, and that was not fun. But they surely looked mysterious and lovely. We loved Iran and her friendly people. Thank you, Armenian community of Iran for your heartwarming reception. Thank you, Rita Tchertchian and Lemuel Abedian from the 2001 Commemoration Committee. Thank you, Ambassador Gharibjanian, for your cordial reception at the Armenian embassy. Thank you, Prelates Sebouh Sarkissian and Gorun Babian, for your personal attention. Thank you, Vehapar. Thank you, Prelacy. Thanks a million, Vasken Ghougassian. Photo (Dr. Vasken Ghougassian)","Yeretsian, Ara K",Armenian Reporter International,2000-10-21,0
"Open Letter to My Turkish Friends Almost 77 years after the declaration of the Turkish Republic and efforts by the followers of Kemal to adopt Western standards, it is difficult to understand the overreaction of the educated and sophisticated new generation of Turks against the passage of the Armenian Genocide Bill by the US House Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. Being sons and daughters of the newly established republic, why are you having difficulty in distancing yourselves from the past Ottoman legacy and often forgetting the new-world views and teaching of Kemal Ataturk? Why not renounce and condemn the past excesses and crimes of the Young Turk leadership, not only against Armenians but also Turks, since they were the guilty ones for taking the Ottoman Empire into World War I with the ill-fated vision of creating a Pan-Turkish Empire? With the illusion of establishing a Greater Turania, these incomplete leaders caused the destruction of the mighty Ottoman Empire, and suffering to its millions of subjects. This is nothing to be proud of. They created a despotic regime with virulent nationalism and divided the subjects of the Empire into different categories: Muslim Turks; non-Turkic Muslims (code name for Alevi Kurds and Arabs); Infidels (title reserved for Jews, Greeks, Bulgarians, Serbs and Armenians). They destroyed the social texture and economy of the country. COVERUP FOR FAILURE The incompetent leadership of Enver Pasha caused the destruction of the entire Eastern army. Contrary to the lies fabricated about Armenian treachery, Armenian recruits in the Ottoman army fought gallantly and died alongside their Muslim compatriots to defend their common home in Anatolia. Yet, in order to cover up his failure, Enver blamed the Armenians for the eastern disaster. To rectify their military losses, the Ottoman leadership was looking for a scapegoat and accused the Armenians of insurrection. Under the pretext of national security, deportation orders were issued (Tehcir, Sevkiat). We all know what happened to these millions of deportees; they were all sent to the killing fields under the supervision of the Special Forces (Teshkilati Mahsusiye) and they were all decimated in cruelty. Rape, torture, destruction, and murders continued day and night. Most true Muslim believers were outraged and raised their voices to protest the killings and attempted to save the victims from destruction, but the power of the state and zealousness of the special killing squads organized by the government overwhelmed and overpowered these voices. Governors and mayors who couldn't bear the suffering of the Armenians resigned out of protest or were fired from their positions for helping the Armenians. All the available documents from German, Austrian, Russian, American, and British sources prove beyond a doubt that the Armenian atrocities were premeditated, organized and executed by the higher echelons of the Ottoman government. After the conclusion of WWI, Enver, Talat, and Djemal Pasha and other Ottoman leaders responsible for the Armenian atrocities and destruction of the Empire, fled the country out of fear of persecution, and later were condemned to death in absentia by the Ottoman Military Tribunal for their treachery. During the war of liberation in 1920-23, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk refused to cooperate with these discredited former ottoman leaders when they offered their assistance. In fact, Ataturk blamed and condemned these adventures for the destruction of 1.5 million Christian subjects. OVERREACTION AND DEFENSIVENESS Why then are today's Turks overreacting and relentlessly defending the past conduct and crimes of Talat, Enver and Djemal Pasha? Wouldn't it be more humane and prudent to keep a distance from their criminal activities, and blame them for the Armenian atrocities and the destruction of the Empire? Through such a condemnation, the present generation of Turks could become disassociated from the burdens of history and try to establish good relation with the Armenian people. After all, the Turks used to call the Armenians millet i sadika (loyal subjects) for their obedience to the state, for their contributions to Ottoman art, literature, music and architecture, not to mention their military service to the Ottoman state during WWI, during the Balkan War and on the Eastern front. What did the Armenians do wrong to deserve such hatred? Why was the entire Anatolian Armenian population subjected to extermination? Why were the Armenian culture and monuments destroyed? Today, revisionist Turkish historians are following the path of the so-called historian Ahmet Esat Uras, one of the participants and organizers of the Armenian Genocide, who fabricated the myth of so-called civil war and the theory of inter-communal and interethnic war, whereby two million Muslims also perished along with 300,000 Armenian civilians. He intentionally omitted mention that the Turkish causalities occurred on the several war fronts, whereas the destruction of the peaceful Armenian population occurred in the nearby hills, valleys and rivers. Every honest informed person knows that this imaginary so-called civil war never existed. Can anyone believe that, after 200,000 Armenian recruits were drafted into the Ottoman army, assigned to labor battalions (Amele Taburu) and subsequently murdered, the deported old men, women and children, who were starving and ill, could organize a resistance against the omnipotent Ottoman military machine? The myths of the so-called civil war, Armenian insurrection or Armenian collaboration with the enemy were and still are a pure fabrication by the perpetrators and their modern supporters. HISTORICAL FACTS When the ambassador of wartime ally Germany energetically protested the genocide, the CUP (Committee of Union and Progress) leadership raised their hands in feigned helplessness. When the US ambassador protested against the atrocities, Talat boasted that the Armenian Question had already been resolved and he could not do anything to undo it. Donald Quataert, in his book The Ottoman Empire 1700-1922, eloquently states, Ottoman officers, soldiers, and civilian officials - the very persons who has sworn the responsibility to defend and protect the lives of all Ottoman subjects regardless of religion and ethnicity - murdered the vast numbers of Armenian civilians, men, women, and children alike. To the surprise of all informed people, today the modern Turks are using the same arguments to deny the Armenian Genocide. Wouldn't it be more prudent to put the blame on the already discredited Talat, Enver, and Djemal Pashas and disassociate the present generation of Turks from past burdens of history? There are enlightened Turkish intellectuals, like Taner Akcam, Ragip Zarakolu, Murat Belge, Mehmet Ali Birand, Kaan Soyak, and many others, who are advising the recognition of the Armenian Genocide in order to reconcile Turks and Armenians and to close the dark pages of 1915-1923. These Turks are real patriots; they know well that in order to save the good name of the Turkish nation, the establishment of good neighborly relations between Turks and Armenians is important, and admission of guilt and an apology are the only way for confidence building. Reconciliation between Armenians and Turks will facilitate the establishment of peace and stability in the Caucasus. This will create a milieu for mutual cooperation among the states of the region in the fields of economy and trade, science and technology, and then the realization and development of the Caspian and Caucasian energy sources will be possible. TURKISH THREATS Turkish hawks like the former Turkish Ambassador to Washington Sukru Elekdag, former Turkish Foreign Service official Gunduz Suphi Aktan, former State Minister Altemur Kilic, and the Turkish military establishment are not against reconciliation, they are for punitive actions against Armenia. In order to intimidate and to discourage passage of the Armenian Genocide Resolution, the Turkish government is declaring that it will not only stop Armenia's use of the existing air corridor over Turkish territory but will also tighten the blockade around Armenia and harden the Turkish position in the Karabagh negotiations. Turkey is also threatening to take the following punitive actions against the US interests: excluding the US from Cyprus negotiations and hardening the Turkish position on the Cyprus issue. The US will be excluded from the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline project. The right to the US to use the Incirlik air base will be denied, thus preventing flights over the Iraqi territory, and the lucrative military contracts will be cancelled. Why should the recognition of the Armenian Genocide be subjected to this kind of violent and erratic reaction by the Turkish nationalists? The answer is that they are convinced this will lead to the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the other European nations. The nationalist Turks are trying to take advantage of their country's geopolitical location and are using lucrative military contracts and other financial deals as a tool to forcefully prevent recognition of historical realities. Turkish hawks are indirectly continuing the policy of genocide by not recognizing it or rationalizing it with their justification. My Turkish friends, whether you believe it or not, many of you carry Armenian blood, being products of a onetime Anatolian melting pot, or you may be the sons or daughters of kidnapped or raped Armenian women or circumcised Armenian men forcefully converted to Islam who married Turkish women. No matter what, you cannot undo the historical process, which amalgamated the different ethnic groups in the multiethnic Ottoman society. Narrow-minded modern Turkish nationalists, like their predecessors, are not only attempting to purify Anatolia of non-Turkic stocks but also rewrite its past history. VIRULENT NATIONALISM This kind virulent nationalism will delay Turkey's democratization and integration into the European community. My Turkish friends, contrary to official propaganda Armenians don't hate the Turkish people; Armenians only resent the Turkish rulers who are sowing enmity and hatred among us and are justifying and rationalizing the Armenian Genocide. Individual Armenians and Turks get along well and can communicate with one other through common language. They may enjoy the same type of food and music and may share common memories from the not too distant past. Today one may still witness the past Armenian presence in the cemeteries or abandoned churches and historical ruins which dot the eastern provinces. Or they may enjoy or admire the contributions of the numerous Armenian artisans, craftsmen, artists, musicians and architects in Istanbul and elsewhere.] Religion is also not an issue since Christian Armenians have brotherly relations with Muslim Arabs and Iranians, and they call one another's country fraternal. It is also a fact the Armenians never had a problem with true believers, whether they are Muslim Turks or Kurds. The existing problems were the result of the Turkish nationalists who believed that the Turkish race was superior. Nationalism caused the demise of the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany in WWI and the collapse of the Third Reich during WWII. The emergence of neo-nationalism in Turkey is not only preventing reconciliation with its past history but also hindering the abandonment of the Ottoman legacy and forcing Turks to defend discredited former Ottoman government officials and adventurers who cause the demise of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenian people are ready to make peace but, for this, a reciprocal gesture by the modern Turks is anticipated. The moment that the modern Turks will be able to dissociate themselves from and condemn the crimes of the triumvirate of Talat, Enver and Djemal Pashas, and apologize for inflicting injustice on the Armenian people, then the realization of true reconciliation between Armenians and Turks will be possible.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-09-30,0
"A New Solution to the Jerusalem Issue: The Sovereign Battle over a Sovereign Jerusalem! Al-Quds! Yerushalaim! Jerusalem! It is the Holy City's a city of two peoples and three religions! This is the emotive cry that comes out daily from the mouths of politicians, religious leaders, academicians, analysts, lobbying parties and interest groups. It is almost a rallying call which reflects the centrality of Jerusalem in the lives of countless people the world over. But it also underscores the different viewpoints held by those who are involved in the relentless attempts to find a political solution to this universal city. Indeed, many suggestions and different interpretations abound, some more serious than others! And, with this quest for a solution to Jerusalem, the term `sovereignty' has also become the buzz word in many circles. So much so that an uninformed person can perhaps be excused for thinking that everything to do with the 52-year-old Palestinian-Israeli conflict has been neatly resolved and packaged, and that the sole outstanding discord between Palestinians and Israelis today centers squarely on the future of this fateful city! True, much headway has been achieved over the past few weeks and months, but there are other issues - not least that of refugees and their right of return - that still beg for equitable and lasting answers. A SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE PROBLEM Nonetheless, and given the various commentaries that crop up about Jerusalem on a daily basis, I would like to focus here and now on this seemingly intractable problem. And to do that, I would like to disassemble its component parts. In the words of the Roman jurist Rovanes, I shall attempt to `be bold enough to come up with a bold solution to a bold problem.' If I were to adopt a purist approach to the political problem of Jerusalem, relying exclusively on the precepts of International law, United Nations Security Council Resolutions and international legitimacy, I would have no hesitation in providing an unequivocal answer. The whole of East Jerusalem is territory occupied by Israel in June 1967. No country, or federation of countries, has ever acknowledged any other interpretation on the status of the city. Every member of the United Nations - with one or two largely insignificant exceptions - has refused to deviate from the line that this is occupied territory, and that UNSC resolution 242 and 338 as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention apply fully. Foreign embassies are situated outside Jerusalem, and the foreign consuls in Jerusalem do not even get the exequatur from Israel. As such, any ironic initiative could simply emphasize that the proper solution would entail a withdrawal by Israel from occupied territories, and that a future Palestinian state need be perched on this whole land mass with East Jerusalem as its capital. And, mind you, I am neither being a nationalist nor trying to be a patriot here! I am simply reflecting the general consensus of the whole international world comity. And as an Armenian Jerusalemite Christian, I would also subscribe to this thesis. However, life is rarely that straightforward since human beings have an uncanny propensity to weave tangled webs for themselves! Indeed, the Palestinian- Israeli conflict has produced a rich set of demographic realities on the ground that can neither be circumvented nor ignored easily. Jerusalem is one such illustration, and more particularly that part of the old city of Jerusalem within the walls which has become the focus of the whole world. This is a small parcel of land that is barely bigger than 900 dunams. It is home to the four Muslims, Christian, Jewish and Armenian quarters. It enshrines most of the holy places that are near and dear to the faithful from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faith communities. This one square kilometer of disputed land (or perhaps two square kilometers if I were to add the Mount of Olives to it) houses around 33,000 inhabitants. According to one set of statistics, 23,500 Muslims live on 461 dunams of land, 6,500 Christians (including Armenians) live on 318 dumans of land (the Christian quarter consists of 192 dunams and the Armenian quarter consist of 126 dunams), and 2,500 Jews live on 122 dunams of land. And this small plot of Jerusalem, rich in its religious history, represents now the biggest challenge to the Palestinian and Israeli peace-makers. SMALL PLOT, BIG CHALLENGE And the problem is axiomatic! Israel insists that it has the right to exercise sovereignty over this whole patch of land, whereas the Palestinians - supported by the Arab and Muslim worlds - insist that they themselves are entitled to acquire sovereignty over it. And given the geography of the old city, any final status agreement over it with its competing sovereignties would inevitably impact the scores of major Christian holy places as much as the Haram al-Sharif (the Muslim Noble Sanctuary) and the Western Wall that also fall within its walls. But is there no possible egress from this stand-off? Can no creative solution be found to translate the dynamics of power, as much as win-lose or lose-lose equations, into win-win ones for peoples? I believe there is - even if my suggestion were to appeal impractical or facile at first glance! However, let me start off by introducing a note of caution that convolute discussions over different forms of sovereignty - could well become counterproductive. For one, such vague phraseologies that lack much solid legal footing or practical grounding tend to confuse the issue. Worse, they could render even more hazardous the task of concluding a peaceful solution. But what is our understanding of sovereignty - supreme power in the legal vernacular - as it stands today? There is no doubt in my mind that the whole concept of sovereignty has undergone tremendous change and evolution in the last one hundred years. Developed in the 16th century by Jean Bodin, it was meant to devise a system which would allow the kind complete authority over the areas he ruled at the time. Later, Thomas Hobbes chiseled this concept further and expanded it into a theory that wielded absolute control with an absolutist approach. Otherwise said, the state had absolute power over all things. Sovereignty was transmuted into an instrument that served national mythologies. It became a shibboleth for control. THE CONCEPT OF SOVEREIGNTY TODAY However, the concept of sovereignty has lost much of its rigid and absolutist definitions over the years. If one looks at many parts of the developed world - notably the European Union - one concludes that the assumption of inflexible borders between nation-states is fast disappearing. Gradual democratization has led to gradual decentralization too. So, it is possible to adopt a concept for the old city of Jerusalem that would purge sovereignty of its sacred aura and adapt instead a solution that would comply with its makeup? I believe that International law and case law have come a long way toward suggesting creative solutions whereby people could live together without reaching an agreement over, or even addressing the issue, of sovereignty. The case of the New Hebrides/Vanuatu islands in the Pacific Ocean put paid to the idea that sharing sovereignty is an easy solution. On the contrary, it could be quite messy! But in the South Pole case in 1995, and in the earlier case of the Falkland Islands in 1983 between Britain and Argentina, it was proven that it is possible, after all, to live together without reaching an agreement on the matter of sovereignty. In other words, those cases support the contention that it is quite possible to `suspend' any decision on sovereignty until a later stage and instead install in place a series of administrative measures that would run the daily life of the people. Or else, it is equally possible to `divest' sovereignty from the decision-making process and focus instead on those mechanisms that make a place work - such a fundamental freedoms, municipal arrangements or tourism. Otherwise said, any such decision would remove the emotional pain of `conceding', `losing' or `compromising' on the abstract concept of `absolute ownership' and would tackle instead the `practical' issues that are of concern to all residents A WELCOME HOST I believe that the old city of Jerusalem could be a welcome host to such an idea, more to because of its intense religious significance to the adherents of all three monotheistic religions. After all, what distinguishes the old city of Jerusalem from countless other cities dotted across the world is that it represents a sacred space to so many holy shrines. A shift in emphasis and realism over the Old City - with its holy places - is necessary today. In fact, the `vacuum theory' in International Law - as elaborated by the likes of Professor Steven Weijsczik - expounds the possibility of overstepping sovereignty in places where there is competition over the application of such an absolutists concept. What this variant implies in essence is that any two parties put also (suspended temporarily or divest permanently) the concept of sovereignty as the focus of their negotiations and look rather to the possibility of setting up a council that would provide the administrative system and regulatory measures necessary to govern a particular area. What does this mean for the old city of Jerusalem in concrete terms? It means that Jerusalem would remain an open city. The Palestinians would control the Muslim, Christian and Armenian quarters that are demographically and ethnically appurtenant to them, whereas Israel would retain control over the Jewish quarter. The practical consequence of such a set-up is that the city will no longer be divided or partitioned, but that the Christian and Muslim shrines would fall collectively under Palestinian control, whereas the Western Wall under Israeli control. Since there exist established and recognized procedures of governance in all those places - not least the Status Quo agreement for the Christian shrines - both parties would end up exercising `de facto' sovereignty but will not insist upon any absolutist `de jure' enforcement of their rights. Such a `vacuum theory' becomes even more relevant when one considers that the Jerusalem of two square kilometers would then acquire a special statute for itself, which would be enforced through a panel of international institutions - notably the United Nations. Jerusalem would become stricto sensu a spiritual capital, no longer a political capital. It would belong to all the residents of the old city, and they can relate to each other as much as to its other neighborhoods, in harmony. BREAKTHROUGH POSSIBLE Can the parties achieve such a breakthrough? With difficulty, but yes! However, this can only happen if both Palestinians and Israelis disinvest themselves of absolutist solutions and become willing partners in a more pragmatic solution. I admit that this scenario is far from being an easy one. After all, sovereignty is a reassuring concept: it provides certainly and gives the Palestinians - by far the aggrieved and dispossessed party - a since of recuperative dignity. However, I started off my thesis by postulating that we must consider win-win solutions rather that maintain redundant ideologies which prey on peoples' weaknesses and insecurities. Can good will galvanize both parties' efforts to help them tailor a solution that will extricate us from this political morass? Can we nurture a sense of belonging in Palestinians and Israelis alike that no longer talks in mutually exclusive terms but accepts an inclusive framework for the future? As men and women of faith, let us not forget that we must always be advocates of justice but also tools of reconciliation. Whatever our particular tradition, religion teaches us one every basic truth: that all human blood flows red and that if you are cut, you will bleed homage can we pay our Maker than by doubling our efforts toward such a consensus and fulfilling God's wish for peace? When writing about the future glory of Jerusalem, did the prophet Isaiah not describe the walls of Jerusalem Salvation and its gates Praise (Is 60-18)?","Hagopian, Harry",Armenian Reporter International,2000-09-23,0
"Footprints in the Desert-Part I: A Journey through Recent Armenian History - March 29 - April 12, 2000 When I read the announcement for this trip, I thought that it would be a very difficult journey and deliberated a long time before deciding to go. The main theme of the tour to Syria and Lebanon was Armenian: to travel to the Syrian Desert and follow the footsteps of our parents and grandparents who, forcefully deported from their homeland, had arrived there 85 years earlier. However, other than the Armenian theme, the itinerary included visits to distinct areas of interest in Sumerian, Greco-Roman, Early Christian, Islamic, and Crusader history. This trip was organized by Armen Aroyan, an engineer by training, who has led many groups through Historic Armenia and the Middle East. There would be 24 people from different parts of the United States and Canada. We would all meet in Paris and travel to Damascus together. Other than six of us who had been students at the same Armenian school in Cairo, Egypt, I did not know anyone else in the group. In Paris, as I met the others arriving on different flights, my first impression was that everyone seemed to be quite nice. Later I realized that I was fortunate to be with twenty-three kind, caring, and wonderful people. As the days went by, we became better acquainted and I had the pleasure of learning more about my fellow travelers, as we shared many sad, funny and overall enjoyable memories. There were times when it was extremely difficult being in a place like Raqqa or Der ez Zor, or for the first time seeing the clear waters of the Euphrates, only to remember that so many had perished in its bloodied waters in 1915. Being with a group of people who shared the same past made this easier to bear. March 29, 2000 The flight from Paris to Damascus is uneventful and, after a bus ride through the capital in the evening darkness, we arrive at a beautiful hotel. During dinner I have a chance to get acquainted with a few in the group, before going to my room for the night. March 30, 2000 Bright and early, we are on the bus ready to go and explore. The first place on our itinerary is Maalula, a Christian village where people still speak Aramaic. There is a wealth of early Christian history in Syria. We stop at a monastery where we are greeted by two priests. The elder welcomes us in English and escorts us to the church, where we sing the Lord's Prayer in Armenian and hear the younger priest pray in Aramaic. We also visit another monastery and orphanage operated by nuns. This is a very religious town, and I file the experience in my memory as Early Christian. After a pleasant westward drive through green hills and olive groves, we arrive at Crac des Chevaliers, the mighty crusader castle from the twelfth century. My first impression from a distance is that it looks like one of those three-dimensioned jigsaw puzzles. We stop at a rest area past the castle, and the view is excellent: a green hill capped with this unbelievably well preserved, magnificent castle. It has a black basalt foundation with walls of sandstone ranging in color from almost white to pink. We enter through a sharply turning dark passage, into the sunlit inner keep, and view the double massive walls and moats protecting the citadel. We walk through the areas where humans lived, prayed and kept their animals. We look at the vast cisterns that collected rainwater, and imagine how the Crusaders fought their enemies with arrows, catapults and boiling oil. We climb up a narrow circular stairway to reach the highest tower, from where there are magnificent views of the surrounding green hills. When the forces of the Knights Hospitalers arrived in early twelfth century, they found a small Kurdish fort guarding the gap in the coastal mountain range that runs solid from Turkey to Lebanon. The Crusaders occupied it for more than 150 years, during which time they carried out much construction to fortify the castle and make all the improvements needed for their comfort. Crac des Chevaliers was impregnable. Attacking Arab armies did not succeed in taking it, nor did earthquakes weaken it. Eventually, it was taken in 1271 after a siege set by the Mameluke Sultan Baibars. After several weeks, the starving Crusaders surrendered and were allowed to leave the country. The Arabs called it Qalaat al Hosn, Castle of the Knights. Centuries later, it was abandoned as a fortification. Now it is maintained by the Syrian Ministry of Antiquities. We continue our trip to the coast and Latakia, where we'll be staying the next two nights. We drive through Tartous (Tortosa), where the bus briefly tours around the 13th century Cathedral of Our Lady of Tortosa, which has been converted to a museum and is closed. After a pleasant ride along the Mediterranean coast, we arrive at our hotel, tired but exhilarated. I'm thrilled to see that the hotel is right at the water's edge, and that night I persuade a few of my friends to go for a walk on the beach. March 31, 2000 The group gets on the bus again, now with our Armenian guide, Gina Zobian, who has arrived to meet us and will be with us until we leave Syria. She is an architect by training and very knowledgeable. Kessab is our destination today. As we all know, it is a village very close to the Turkish border, where the majority of inhabitants are Armenian. Kessab is one of very few places from the Cilician Kingdom where Armenians have lived continuously since the 12th century. Currently, there are about 2000 Armenians still living here. They have Armenian schools and Apostolic, Evangelical and Catholic churches. As we get closer, I sense that there is much anticipation in a few in our group who have visited Kessab in the past. Armen Aroyan has fond memories of a summer spent in Kessab as a teenager. Rosig Injejikian had visited there as a young bride with her Kessabtsi husband and is eager to find the old places that she remembers. Nazareth Kevonian spends a few weeks in Kessab every summer, volunteering in Land and Culture restoration work. Just before getting to Kessab, we briefly stop at the hamlet of Eskuran where we see the Sourp Asdvadzadzin (Holy Mother of God) Chapel, built in 1959, and chat with a few villagers. In Kessab, our first stop is at the Holy Trinity Evangelical Church, which was founded in 1909. We meet the young minister, Rev. Vatche Ekmekjian, who informs us about his parish activities. There is the United Evangelical Elementary School across the street, which we enter to watch children having physical education class outdoors. While talking with some students in Armenian, I realize that a few of them are Arabs attending Armenian school. We enter the Sourp Asdvadzadzin Apostolic Church, where we meet Der Yeghishé Sarkisian and say prayers together. The Sourp Mikayel Catholic Church, with its adjoining Armenian Catholic School, dominates the top of the hill. We spend several hours exploring the village, noticing the restoration work done by Land and Culture volunteers, visiting landmarks, talking to schoolchildren and getting better acquainted with each other. We have a brief stop and are treated to Armenian coffee on the terrace of Hotel Sevan. The time has come for our departure, as we are planning to visit Aramo, another Armenian village, before returning to Latakia for the night. Unfortunately, the road to Aramo is closed and we are obliged to change our plans and return to Latakia, after a stop at Ugarit, the 14th century BC excavation site where a tablet with the earliest alphabet was discovered. Everyone in the group is happy with the day's activities. April 1, 2000 After a good night's rest, we're ready for the day's expedition. As with the previous days, we have a busy schedule. We travel inland from Latakia to visit the great Salaheddin Castle, which we reach by a narrow, winding road. The Byzantines built the original castle on the site of ancient fortifications. The Crusaders controlled it briefly in the early 12th century, when it became known as Saone Castle. Salaheddin occupied it after a siege in 1188, and the Arabs maintained it as a major military fortification until Ottoman rule when it was abandoned. This castle is situated on a ridge between two deep gorges forming a V towards the west; at the opposite end, a deep chasm was cut in the rock between the two gorges, to separate the castle from the ridge towards the east. Where this cut has been made, there remains a single rock, which supported a drawbridge to the entrance of the castle. It is difficult to imagine how this 60-foot-high wall was carved out of the cliff, with the tools available in the 11th century! We enter the castle from a side door. The remains of the original Byzantine fortress can still be seen in the central courtyard. The Crusader additions are the magazine, the underground cisterns and the three-storied large donjon (or keep), which we enter, climb through all the floors to the roof, and see great views of the green countryside. Most of the remaining buildings, including a mosque and a bath, are from the Arabic period. We move on to visit Aramo, which is another Armenian village from the times of the Armenian Cilician kingdom. Nazareth, who is familiar with the area, tells us about Armenian churches built on a cliff in the surrounding hills and we decide to explore. After some inquiry, we climb onto a hill, and find the ruins of Sourp Asdvadzadzin (St. Mary's) Chapel. Next to it is the Sourp Kevork Church built into a cave, now used as an Islamic (Alawi) prayer site. Back in Aramo, we find Sourp Stepanos Armenian Church. An Armenian youth appears with a key to the gates and we enter the church to say our prayers. In the churchyard, I notice an ancient khachkar, lying on its side, used as a building block for this church built around 1860; I can only guess that it must be much older than the church and probably brought from elsewhere. Pretty soon, a church elder, Khoren Antreassian, arrives and leads us in prayer. This village is known to have had 60 Armenian families in 1900, who were subjected to massacres as elsewhere; a few immigrated to Armenia and now there are about 30 Armenians living in Aramo. We are told that they have regular church service every Saturday and Sunday. This concludes the Armenian activities for the day and we start our descent to the valley of the Orontes River, where the land is cultivated and green, and where they also maintain fish farms. Along the road we notice many colorful gypsy encampments. The day is getting late, but we have other places to see. We are traveling to glorious Apamea, city of 120,000 inhabitants in ancient times. I don't know whether it was the time of day, the kind of rosy light of the late afternoon sun, or the ruins themselves, but for me this is the most appealing Greco-Roman site I have ever seen. Later, after visiting Palmyra and Baalbeck, my opinion of Apamea stays the same. Our very competent guide takes us for more than an hour's walk among the ruins. The Cardo Maximus, the almost two-kilometer-long main avenue running north to south, is a joy to behold. Walking northward to the Antioch Gate, we see columns of many styles: Smooth, fluted, or spiral columns, all supporting Corinthian capitals. Back in the 2nd century demolished them. Almost 200 of these columns have been restored and are upright now. We visit the remains of palatial houses, the agora with a facade resting on six magnificent columns, the Tycheon or temple of the goddess of fortune, and the public baths. Across the Decumanus, which was the main road crossing the Cardo and which is now covered with a paved modern road, we visit the Cathedral built over Greek ruins. This is a reminder that Apamea was also an important Christian center in Byzantine times. In this area there are the remains of beautiful mosaic floors, most of which have been moved to the Apamea Museum. Finally, it's getting dark and we are tired and ready to get back on the bus. Tonight's stop will be in Hama, the fourth largest city in Syria, famous for its waterwheels. This is an ancient irrigation device: wheels with buckets attached, turning to raise water from a river. We drive past the Mudiq castle, another Arab fortification, now inhabited by villagers. It is a very pleasant ride in the twilight. I'm hoping that in the morning we'll have a chance to see the waterwheels. What a surprise when we arrive in Hama and notice two of those waterwheels across the square from the hotel. April 2, 2000 Hama is an all-Muslim city. I wake up at 5:30 with the Islamic call to prayer. We are leaving early to arrive in Aleppo in time to attend Sunday service. I still have a chance to photograph the waterwheels from the hotel terrace. The drive is uneventful; most of us on the bus are napping, except when someone comments on some interesting view or yet another picture of President Assad displayed along the road. We arrive in Aleppo and go directly to church. The evening before, we had a lengthy discussion regarding traveling from Hama to Aleppo in clothes appropriate to attend church. This morning it's impressive to see everyone on the bus in their traveling Sunday best, especially the men, who are quite cheerful about wearing coats and ties. The Forty Martyrs' Church in Aleppo is an old, asymmetrical building with ancient murals and paintings. The courtyard has a new monument to the Genocide. I wonder whether my mother, aunt and grandmother attended this church when they lived here in 1915. I can't help remembering that my aunt and my mother had spent very sad days in an orphanage in Aleppo, because my grandmother had no means of feeding them. There is church service, but we are too early for Mass. We are invited to visit the museum where we find many ancient church articles; the docent informs us that this building was the original Sourp Asdvadzadzin, dating back to the 15th century. Now it's time to go to our hotel and rest briefly. This afternoon is devoted to a tour of Aleppo. The bus takes us to new neighborhood where we see beautiful villas and much construction. We drive through Armenian neighborhoods, stop at the new Sourp Asdvadzadzin Church, visit the Aram Manougian Armenian Center where we're offered a tour of the three-storied building inaugurated in 1988. We also stop briefly at the historic Baron Hotel on Baron Street, owned by the Mazloumian family, where we see a display case of memorabilia from famous guests such as T.E. Lawrence. The bus is taking us next to the Citadel of Aleppo. A few of us in the group are willing to climb the 90 steps at the main entrance and find a fascinating interior, with mosques, dungeons, water cisterns and the rulers' throne room, which has a secret escape route that we take to get back down. We rejoin the rest of the group for a tour of the bazaar. It is an interesting experience to bargain for prices and make purchases through an interpreter. In all that human traffic, the group somehow manages to stay together and we return to the hotel for a brief respite and to get ready for the evening's entertainment, which was not on our original schedule. There is a performance of the Hamazkayin Zvartnots Choir that night and most of the group has decided to attend. This is a pleasant performance and there is much potential talent in the young choir. I am glad I ignored my fatigue and decided to come. April 3, 2000 As usual, we are up bright and early, on our way to visit the Dead Cities of the North. A short distance outside Aleppo, our guide stops the bus so that we can step on and photograph an ancient Roman road which connected Antioch and Calchis. It's amazing that one can still drive a car on it. For me it's always fascinating to see a Roman road, ever since learning about them in Armenian history class. The Dead Cities are deserted towns where the original Christians lived and practiced their religion in secret. Before we arrive at Qalaat Samaan, St. Simeon's Castle, we visit the ruins of small towns and churches in the northern hills, such as the isolated village of Qirq Bizeh, with its buildings of gray stone richly carved with intricate geometrical designs and its small church said to be built at the beginning of the 4th century, making it one of the earliest churches built in Syria. We also visit the Byzantine-period Qalb Lozeh, the well-preserved church of three aisles built of reddish sandstone, situated near a Druze village. Before we start our tour of St. Simeon's, we are offered an impromptu lunch brought by our guide and prepared by her mother. What a pleasant time we have, as we all sit together under the shade of ancient trees. Spirits are high, and we organize an impromptu choir to sing our thanks to Gina's mother for the delicious food. St. Simeon's is a beautiful place; a complex of churches built on the site where a quirky saint lived. Simeon was a monk who chose to live an ascetic's life, and he achieved sainthood by living on top of a pillar for thirty-six years. Many believers came to visit and listen to him preach. Eventually after he died, a vast beautiful church of pink sandstone was erected to accommodate all the pilgrims who came to visit the place where the saint had lived. There are seven steps extending the full length of the façade leading up to the entrance of the Basilica. The layout is in the shape of a cross, four churches opening onto an octagon. The famous pillar, now only a large rounded piece of stone, is at the center of the octagon. Across a large open space, next to the ruins of another basilica, stands the baptistery where new Christians were baptized before entering St. Simeon's Basilica. This is a place of symmetry and serenity, stone delicately carved with designs of grapes and foliage shaking in the wind. It is a joy walking among these ruins on a beautiful sunny day. In the early afternoon, we get on the but content with the day's activities, but there is more ahead. We return to Aleppo, to recuperate and start a walking tour of the inner city. We visit an Islamic mental hospital from the 14th century, an asylum of tranquility, which was noted for having advanced notions on how to treat patients; a soap factory, which has almost no machinery; and a caravan-serai for traveling merchants, which is now used as shops. Some in our group have decided to eat out at an Armenian restaurant, and a few of us have a cheerful dinner at the hotel. This has been another wonderful day.

"His Holiness Karekin II, Catholicos of All Armenians, Attends Opening Sessions of Millennium World Peace Summit at United Nations in NY: Reconciliation is theme of Catholicos Karekin II's Aug. 29 address His Holiness Karekin II, the Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, took part in the inaugural ceremonies and opening sessions of the Millennium World Peace Conference of Religious and Spiritual Leaders. The gathering of over one thousand religious figures from around the world is meeting at the United Nations building here, from August 28 through 31. His Holiness has traveled to the United States specifically to take part in the conference, and arrived with a small entourage in New York on August 19. The opening session on the afternoon of Monday, August 28, began with an eclectic mix of religious invocations, including an Islamic prayer, an Inca blessing, and the harmonious blowing of a conch-shell by a Hindu swami. After welcoming remarks by the conference's secretary-general, Mr. Bawa Jain, a series of thirty brief blessings were pronounced, by representatives from fifteen distinct religions. His Holiness Karekin II offered the sixth blessing, situated between an Islamic grand mufti and a Shinto high priest. Speaking in English, Catholicos Karekin prayed: We are aware, O Lord, that religious differences have brought strife in the past. But we also know that faith in a higher good, in something greater than human power, is the only solid foundation on which to build just societies, tolerant communities and decent lives. While our respective traditions may not always agree on all things, with your guidance, Lord, these differences need not be so great that they stand as barriers to friendship goodwill and common purpose. He concluded: Finally, we ask you to bestow your blessing on this great country of America, which has been a beacon of light for all the nations of the world - among them our own Armenian people, who escaped persecution and found safety on these shores. In this land, the shared values of many people from many different places can grow into true brotherhood. May you guide all your children, and all nations, along this path, O Lord.

"Introductory Review of Armenian-Turkish Viewpoints and Their Fundamental Differences Recently we read an array of differing views pertaining to Armenian-Turkish relations over the past ten decades. Rather than assessing these relations based on historical, political, social and scientific perspectives, there is a tendency to present those events based on personal opinions, emotions, and misinformation, devoid of historical facts and today's geopolitical realities. It is a fact that the Turks are following a well-planned agenda and sophisticated propaganda campaign full of misinformation and distortions. Some Armenians have accepted Turkish challenges, allegations and pacification efforts as goodwill gestures, and are having difficulty realizing the dangers arising from coordinated efforts by the Turkish government and the so-called independent-minded Turkish intellectuals. Yes, it is important to establish a dialogue between Armenian and Turks at the grass-roots level, and inform the misinformed Turkish masses with historical facts, if one assumes that the Turks are not familiar with the Armenian deportations and massacres that took place in the not so distant past, during the last Ottoman period or at the time of the formation of the Turkish Republic. Yet the truth is that the Turks, in general, are familiar with the Armenian question, but for them this issue is a dead issue. ARMENIANS JUMP-STARTING THE ISSUE The only reason they are reacting is because Armenians worldwide are pursuing this matter very vigorously. If the Armenians stop pushing for recognition of the Armenian Genocide, the Turks too will stop discussing it, as if nothing has happened. Unilateral concession by the Armenians will not be reciprocated; on the contrary, it will be taken as a sign of defeat. The Turks will try to close this chapter of history under the pretext of conducting a dialogue between the Armenians and Turks at the grass-roots level, thus trying to prevent recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the parliament of foreign countries. Their argument will be that any adoption of a Genocide resolution will disturb relations between Armenia and Turkey. It is imperative to learn the prevailing views by the government-controlled Turkish historians, on the one hand, and Armenian historians, on the other. The differences in their interpretation of past and current Armenian-Turkish relations are couched in academic, historical, social, political and historical settings. It is up to the interested reader to agree or disagree with these views, interpretations, and presentations based on their experience, knowledge and conviction. ARMENIAN VIEWS 1. The Armenian Genocide was premeditated, organized and perpetrated by the highest echelons of the Turkish government. 2. The deportation orders intended to exterminate the entire Armenian race and this was carried out by the orders of the Ottoman government. The deportees were delivered to killing fields, to be exterminated by special death squads in the designated areas. Young Turk leaders are seen supervising and liquidation of the deportees. 3. The Turkish civilian population, willingly and diligently, participated in the killing, looting, and raping of the Armenian deportees, under official approval, with the intent of destruction of the Armenians. 1.5 million Armenians were annihilated. 4. Turkish allegations that Armenians were rebelling and asking for independent Armenia are false. The Armenians were only asking for reforms in Ottoman society to secure equal citizenship rights for all Ottoman subjects, as was promised under international treaty obligations, signed by the State. 5. 200,000 Ottoman Armenian conscripts fought bravely during World War I for their Sultan, as attested by Enver Pasha, but later, as a prelude to the Genocide, they were converted to labor battalions and, under the order of the military commander, executed by Turkish comrades as a part of the preplanned extermination of the Armenian race. 6. After the conclusion of World War I, the Ottoman Military Tribunal, established to prosecute the perpetrators of the Armenian deportations and massacres, is evidence of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the Turks at that time. In fact, Talat, Enver, and Djemal Pashas were tried and sentenced to death in absentia. 7. Illegally confiscated Armenian lands were inhabited by Turkish immigrants, seized properties were distributed to the new settlers, Armenian churches and cemeteries were demolished, and a law was passed by the Medjlis of the newly founded Turkish Republic prohibiting the return of the Armenians to their ancestral lands. 8. By denial of the Armenian history and presence in Anatolia and the Eastern, formerly Armenian, provinces, and destroying Armenian churches and monuments, the Turks are continuing the Armenian Genocide in a cultural context. 9. Deprived of their ancestral lands, the Armenians scattered all over the world. Being the rightful heirs to the Armenian victims of the Genocide, they are asking for financial compensation and the return of illegally seized properties to their rightful owners. 10. Guilty of having committed the Armenian Genocide, the Turks are trying to rationalize and justify the Armenian deportations and massacres by shifting blame to the victims. The Turk's have to recognize their ancestors' guilt and apologize. 11. The Armenians are ready to reconcile their differences with their Turkish neighbors. For this, Armenia is asking for the establishment of economic and cultural relations with Turkey as a confidence-building measure without preconditions and third-party involvement. 12. Turkey's aggressive behavior, expansionist trends and unprecedented armaments buildup are presenting a threat to regional peace and stability. Turkey's blockade of Armenia and military assistance to Azerbaijan are considered to be hostile actions against Armenia. 13. Armenia is for the Caucasian Stability Pact and working together with NATO countries under the Partnership for Peace program. Armenia wants the US, Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia and Iran to take part, in order to create peaceful common space for all nations. Turkey is trying to prevent Armenia's collaboration with NATO. 14. Based on their historical experience, the Armenians are concerned over their security. They are asking Turkey to take concrete steps toward improving its relations with Armenia, and for confidence-building measures. 15. Armenia is a peaceful nation, Armenians are not racists, fundamentalists or religious fanatics. They have excellent relations with Muslim Iranians and Arabs. Turkey's support for the annexation of the Meghri and Zankezur district to Azerbaijan is part of the Pan-Turkic scheme which is creating security risk for Armenia, Russia and Iran. TURKISH VIEWS 1. The Ottoman government, because of wartime necessities, relocated the rebellious Armenian population to the interiors for their safety. 2. The Ottoman government provided shelters to the Armenian deportees in designated safety areas. The protection and health care was provided by the authorities to ensure the well being of the refugees. If any killings or excesses occurred, they were the work of criminal elements out of the control of the authorities. 3. The death of the Armenians was the result of intercommunal ethnic and civilian wars, sickness and disease. Besides 400,000 to 600,000 Armenian deaths, 2 million Muslim Turks were also killed by the Armenians. 4. The Armenians were acting like foreign agents and were collaborating with the British and Russians to carve out an independent Armenia from the Ottoman Lands. The Ottoman State was forced to protect its territorial integrity, and deportation orders were given as a wartime necessity. 5. Ottoman Armenian volunteers along the Russian border treacherously fought against Ottoman State, causing battle losses along the Eastern Front, and the loss of 100,000 Turkish soldiers. Armenian collaboration with the enemy prompted the State to take preventive measures against insurgency. 6. The Ottoman War Tribunal was staged by the internal enemies of the Ittihadist, encouraged by the British. After the exile of the Ittihadist leaders to Malta, due to lack of evidence, all were set free by the British, proving the innocence of the Ottoman leadership in 1915. 7. Abandoned Armenian properties and churches, being not claimed by the former occupants and culprits over an extended period of time, became government properties. Today, 50,000 Christian Turks of Armenian ancestry are enjoying equal citizenship rights, refuting allegations to the contrary by the Armenian extremists, and proving that Turks have no ill feelings against Armenians. 8. Armenia never existed as an independent state. The Turks captured Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire. Armenian allegations aimed at having an Armenian State are sheer fabrications; they have no legal rights whatsoever. 9. Armenians left their residence, fearing Turkish vengeance since they were aware of their guilt for inflicting death and terror on the peaceful Muslim population of Eastern Anatolia through Armenian terrorists. Therefore, they forfeited their rights. 10. Armenians guilty of crimes against Turks are deceiving world opinion by defaming the Turkish nation; for their terrorist acts against the Turkish people. 11. Turkey was the first country to recognize Armenia's independence. For establishment of diplomatic relations, Armenians should renounce the Genocide, financial and territorial compensation claims, and should recognize Azeri sovereignty over Nagorno Karabagh. 12. Armenia's military cooperation with Russia and the presence of Russian bases in Armenia is threatening the Caucasus Stability Pact and creating a security risk to the proposed Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project. 13. Turkey is for the Caucasian Stability Pact but Armenia's occupation of 20 percent (?) of Azeri land, and the presence of Russian troops in Armenia is a stumbling block. For this, Armenia should unconditionally withdraw its armed forces from Karabagh and close the Russian bases in Armenia without delay. 14. With their traditional anti-Turkish sentiments, the Armenians are acting like Russian agents and are threatening Turkey's legitimate interests in the Caucasus and the Caspian Basin. Armenians should stop being stooges of Russia. 15. Armenians are the enemies of Islam and the occupiers of Muslim lands. Armenians are in the way of Turkic geographical unity. Armenians should vacate the former Azeri land of Zankezur to end the separation of Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan proper, thus eliminating Iranian, Armenian and Russian threats to Turkic unity. SIMPLISTIC APPROACHES WON'T WORK All these views, perspectives, and national aspirations have different meanings and implications not for Armenia and Turkey alone but to other regional states, including Russia, Georgia, Iran, Syria, Iraq, Greece, the distant US, China, India and others as well. In the Caucasus and the Caspian Basin, national and geopolitical interests of one state collide with those of another. For the Armenian reader, the choice is not as simple as a love-or-hate affair, or being adversary or conciliatory, being a pacifist or activist; it is a life-and-death matter, as Hamlet stated: To be or not to be, that is the question. Simplistic approaches, like mislabeling fellow Armenians as extremists or nationalists, or being pro-Turk, pro-Russian, pro-American or anti-Turk, anti-Russian or anti-American will not solve any of these matters. It will take a lot of serious study and thinking in terms of geopolitics, international relations, national security, and national rights. Every reader should search for honest answers and look for serious answers, the historical challenges are there. After all, it is a fact that today's Turks are aware of their past history and, in private, they confess that what happened to the Armenians was a genocide. Although some of them condemn the killings, they add that Armenians also did the same to Turks. Some may rationalize it since they claim the Ottoman Empire was at war and the State had to take security measures, but Armenian killings shouldn't have occurred at that scale. Most will justify the killings and say that Armenians got what they deserved, and there is no regret or remorse. When those Armenians claim that the Turkish masses will learn the truth only through dialogue at the grass-roots level, they are missing the point. The Turks already know it, but they anticipate that everyone, including Armenians, should accept their version of the history.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2000-09-02,0
"INSIGHT INTO THE NEWS: Ten years after the demise of the USSR; A report card on the new independent states By DAVID MARPLES CONCLUSION Nation-building David Marples is a professor of history at the University of Alberta. This paper was delivered as the keynote address at the banquet of the annual meeting of the Canadian Association of Slavists, held at the University of Alberta on May 29. Slight changes have been made in the format for this version. (The author wishes to thank Stephanie Langton for her assistance in gathering materials.) How far have the new states progressed in nation-building? Do they form a cohesive entity in an established and generally accepted territory? Are they affected by separatism or regionalism? Has the process occurred peacefully? Do they have an accepted native language and culture? Are they independent of former Soviet influences? These questions are complex, and scholars have often disagreed strongly on the conclusions reached. In at least five republics -- Russia, Moldova, Georgia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan -- there are significant territories, encompassing an assertive ethnic minority, that have sought and may continue to seek outright separation from the titular nation. Both Tajikistan and Georgia have requested the intervention of Russian troops in a civil war situation, while in Moldova renegade Russian troops intervened in the Transdniester region, allegedly to defend the rights of the Slavic population against the Moldovan majority. Of these countries, I would argue that Georgia is in the weakest position: it has virtually relinquished control over south Ossetia, Abkhazia is for all intents and purposes a separate republic, and the Black Sea region of Adjaria virtually ignores central decrees from Tbilisi. The Central Asian states (other than Tajikistan) and Azerbaijan are Turkic-speaking and seemed ripe for picking by neighboring states -- especially Turkey and Iran -- in 1991-1992. Russia and Iran were also concerned to maintain or create influence over the general region of the oil-rich Caspian Sea. The West, in turn, sought to push the Central Asians toward a reliable ally (at least in their book), Turkey, rather than a fundamentalist Muslim state like Iran. However, the Central Asian states, including and led by Kazakstan, asserted their independence, notably on the grounds that having just removed one onerous leader (Russia), they were not about to replace her with another. Thus, though friendly with Turkey, they have kept their distance and maintained close economic ties with each other. All but Uzbekistan have friendly ties with Iran, though in no case thus far has Muslim fundamentalism gained much ground. The other external power that can hardly be ignored is China, which has begun to flood the Kazaks, Kirghiz and Tajiks with cheap consumer goods. Moldova deserves a separate word on nation-building because of its remarkable resistance to pressure to unite (or reunite according to one's outlook) with Romania. The Parliament in the capital, Chisinau, has twice rejected proposals that Romanian replace Moldovan as the state language, and, in a referendum of March 1994, over 95 percent supported the country's continuing independence. The most influential factors may have been the continuing dissension in the Transdniester region and the more obvious one that, having been able to freely visit Romania in the post-Soviet period, Moldovans did not like what they saw and had no wish to unite with a country that looked like a throwback to the drab era of late Stalinism. Romania is not West Germany and does not have the money or the time to invest in a former, now impoverished, province. Moldova was also heavily influenced by the Soviet period, a factor that often is curiously overlooked in many contemporary analyses. It accounts, to some extent, for strong regional sentiment in eastern Belarus and Ukraine. Only in the three Baltic states can it be considered negligible -- and even there not among the substantial ethnic Russian population of Latvia and Estonia -- since these states had long insisted that the Soviet takeover of 1940 was illegal. In areas such as language and economic groupings, the NIS have asserted their independence. The Turkic-speaking republics have all adopted different forms of the Turkic alphabet, and Latvia and Estonia have applied a fairly stringent language law that bypassed the so-called Russian immigrants. Language, however, can also be a factor that undermines the process of nation building. This is the case in Belarus, where President Alyaksandr Lukashenka has equated the native language with subversion and opposition to his government (he speaks only Russian in public), and to a lesser extent in Ukraine, where approximately half the population continues to use Russian as the working or conversational language. In Ukraine also, Crimea and oblasts on the Russian border have frequently demanded the establishment of Russian as a second state language. Paradoxically, regional sentiment is most evident in the Russian Federation, though new president Vladimir Putin has stressed as one of his priorities the renewal of central control over the various regions, particularly those rich in resources. The new economic grouping of GUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova) has taken a significant step away from the Russian-dominated CIS toward a more nationally oriented economic and trading association that seeks to maintain good working relations with NATO. In this same regard, both Armenia and Tajikistan seem unlikely to cast off strong Russian influence for the immediate future. Armenia, in addition, has been anxious to end the dispute with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh (the military conflict ended in July 1994) -- somewhat paradoxically given that Armenian President Kocharian was formerly president of this region -- and now prefers that it remain an autonomous region within Azerbaijan as opposed to a separatist enclave that seeks to become attached to Armenia. Human rights I will discuss in this section three issues: freedom of the press; freedom of religion; and toleration of minorities and opposition groups. This brief survey will begin with the freest states and descend to the dictatorships. Estonia is ahead of all other republics on the fast track to membership in the European Union. It has independent radio and TV stations, private newspapers, and freedom of religion (most residents of Estonia are Lutherans), in addition to independent trade unions. Its main flaw has been the citizenship law, which treated many Russian residents as immigrants who were obliged to seek citizenship. This law was amended in December 1998 to ease the path to citizenship for all stateless children born after February 1992. A similar pattern, though with some roadblocks, was followed in Latvia, where 650,000 out of a population of 2.5 million are not yet citizens of the republic. In addition, the judicial system in Latvia is relatively weak, and on occasion the authorities have used excessive force against public demonstrations, particularly if the participants have been Russian. Though I have reservations about some of the claims made against Latvia by the Russian Federation, there is evidence that the Russian population is not always treated fairly. Lithuania, like its neighbors, has established a pluralistic democratic system, although the Communist Party is still officially banned and former KGB officers are subject to a 10-year ban from seeking public office commencing at the start of 1999. Moldova has a significant free press and a fairly typical plethora of political parties (around 50 in all). In the Transdniester region, there has been discrimination against Romanian-Moldovan speakers, and corruption and organized crime are evident at all levels of society. Public demonstrations that slander the state are forbidden, and the judiciary is not completely free. In Ukraine, the government has slowly reduced freedom of the press and an influential group from the Dnipropetrovsk region continues to wield undue influence in the Cabinet. On the other hand, there is a notable toleration for minority groups and a lack of civil conflict. Russia has a free, though increasingly monopolistic press and media. From Chechnya there have been reports of excessive force and torture of prisoners. In Armenia there have been regular, generally unsuccessful attempts to muzzle the press, the bureaucracy is corrupt, and the president appoints the judiciary. The position of the Armenian Apostolic Church has been strengthened vis-a-vis other religions. Neighboring Azerbaijan has banned a number of political parties, and the Shiite Muslim nation has respected the religious rights of Russian and Jewish citizens but continues to persecute minority Kurds and Lezhgins. Kyrgyzstan has been lauded as the exception among the republics of Central Asia for its relative freedom and toleration. The picture, however, has changed in recent years. More frequent are arbitrary arrest and detention, beatings by police, and the use of excessive taxation or accusations of libel to restrict the activities of non-government newspapers and opposition political parties. In contrast, the human rights situation in Kazakstan is gradually improving, especially in the sphere of religious toleration (most Kazaks are Sunni Muslims), though there is official discrimination in favor of the titular but minority Kazaks. The judiciary remains completely imbued with corruption, and prison conditions are deplorable. Though there is a partially independent press, the printing presses remain under government control. Belarus has seen regular violations of human rights, the repression of independent newspapers, arrests and even disappearances of major political opponents of the government. In Tajikistan government control over the presses and newsprint has limited press freedom. Most opposition political parties are banned, and the state controls the trade unions, which in turn supply crucial health care benefits and pension funds. Even travel is restricted within 25 kilometers of the Afghan and Chinese borders. All religious communities require registration with the Committee on Religious Affairs subordinated to the Council of Ministers. President Imomali Rakhmonov personally appears to be anti-religious and anti-Islam, and embodies a real fear of the penetration into his state of Islamic fundamentalism. Uzbekistan has not seen an opposition party since 1993. It is in effect a one-party state run by the proto-Communist People's Democratic Party that conducts wide-scale arrests of opponents on fabricated charges and subjects them to detention, wiretaps, searches and torture. Citizens of Uzbekistan have little or no access to foreign media. As for corruption, suffice it to say that one of the owners of the largest cotton trading enterprises in the country is President Islam Karimov. Here, as in virtually all the former Soviet republics, women are under-represented at all levels of the public sector, and in Uzbekistan they are not regarded as equal citizens. Turkmenistan occupies a special place in this presentation as having the most abysmal human rights record of all the former Soviet republics. Indeed it appears to be significantly worse than under Soviet rule. The U.S.-based Committee for the Protection of Journalists has declared that Turkmenistan stands out among all the republics for having the worst record for the treatment of journalists. Further credits hail from the U.S. Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has termed the country among the worst case scenarios in post-Soviet development. Religious minorities -- most recently Baptists -- are routinely persecuted, and deported if they happen to be foreigners. The media are entirely under government control and critics of the government receive five-year sentences for libel. All journalists are state employees. Though somewhat less repressive in the area of religion, the Law on Freedom of Conscience and Religious Organizations, as amended in 1996, stipulates that any religious organization must contain a minimum of 500 Turkmen citizens over 18 years of age, which effectively allows for the existence of only Sunni Muslims and Russian Orthodox Christians. Conclusions The portrayal here of the first post-Soviet decade -- albeit slightly premature as it should more accurately be called the first post-sovereignty decade -- is not a happy one, though it may put into perspective some of the predicaments experienced by countries such as Russia and Ukraine, which are routinely criticized as a result of their size and a closer scrutiny of events by the international media. Not all the problems that have emerged can be attributed to Soviet rule and the Soviet legacy, though generally the dissolution of the Soviet Union was notable for destroying the ruling group but leaving the political structure and personnel in place. With the notable exception of Belarus, the European countries have attained higher places on this report card than the Asian, but they have also been given a higher priority for foreign investment by the G-7 countries and for loans by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Russia has been weakened by events but continues to exert a strong influence in most areas. But for the two Chechen wars, Russia's record would be significantly better. The Baltic states' eventual acceptance into the EU and perhaps also into NATO may crystallize a new European power bloc that leaves the former Soviet republics isolated and more dependent on Russia than hitherto. This situation would affect Ukraine especially, which along with Moldova would be the next logical place on which the EU in particular might focus. Though Ukraine has made some significant achievements, especially in the foreign policy area, it is crippled by debts to international bodies such as the IMF and to Russia for energy supplies, and also by the continuing ramifications of the Chornobyl disaster. Belarus's record seems especially deplorable given the reformist tendencies of almost all its neighbors and its prime location as a focal point of central Europe. Perhaps the most surprising result of the break-up of the Soviet Union has been the durability of makeshift republics and those based on somewhat arbitrary boundaries. Even the much maligned Turkmenistan -- which could be fittingly characterized as the least desirable place to go on vacation -- has provided evidence of national self-assertion, and Georgia, seemingly threatened by economic collapse and separatist aspirations from all sides, has shown little tendency to descend into chaos. However, the nations that have the most influence on the Central Asian republics and Azerbaijan -- Iran, Turkey, Russia and China -- are themselves far from democratic, and thus there is no external pressure or incentive for these republics to adopt Western paths of development. Indeed, the Chinese model may appear more attractive than most, though some republics, particularly Kazakstan, which has close ethnic ties with northwestern China, are very wary of excessive Chinese influence. In short, the Turkic-speaking states are closer to a form of Oriental despotism than to Western-style democracy. The final results, then, on this report card for the new independent states are as follows based on the four categories examined: Pass with honors: Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia; Pass: Moldova; Borderline: Russia, Ukraine; Narrow failures: Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan; Failures: Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan; Disastrous failures: Turkmenistan, Belarus, Tajikistan.","Marples, David",Ukrainian Weekly,2000-08-27,0
"HAMTRAMCK, Mich.--On May 4, the City Council of this one thriving Polish enclave approved an ordinance to allow mosques to broadcast the Islamic call to prayer onto public streets. Over some heated objections, the unanimous vote by the council makes it one of the few cities in the United States to approve the practice. This is about uniting our community, said Shabad Ahmed, 37, a Bangladeshi immigrant and the first and only Muslim member of the Hamtramck City Council. Supporters of the change outnumbered critics by at least three to one at the meeting, and some quoted the Declaration of Independence or Bill of Rights in defense of the change. They said church bells and other noises are widely accepted--from ice cream trucks to trains. A call to prayer--which is typically less than two minutes, five times per day--will be regulated. If people think it's too loud, they can complain. Critics said the calls would intrude on residents' privacy and the right not to be subjected to religious indoctrination. I don't want this shouted down my throat, said Mary Urbanski, a longtime Hamtramck resident. Hamtramck, the once-predominately Polish Catholic enclave--visited by the Polish Pope, John Paul II, in 1987--now is home to a growing number of immigrants. The 2000 Census reported that 41 percent of the city's 23,000 residents were born abroad and an estimated one-third of the city is Muslim. Thousands of Yemeni, Bangladeshi, Bosnian and other immigrants now live in Hamtramck and pray in the city's seven mosques, along with African-Americans who have lived in the city for decades. The call to prayer has been an Islamic tradition for 1,400 years. Historically sung from the minaret of a mosque, today the call often is a recording played over loudspeakers. Most mosques, even in heavily Muslim Dearborn, do not broadcast calls to prayer. Only one has done so during the past 15 years, with only a single complaint. More than 100 people jammed the Hamtramck City Council chambers for the May 4 meeting. More than 100 people couldn't get in and one man was evicted from the meeting for refusing to wait to be recognized to speak. Hamtramck's public grappling with the issue has gotten international attention, appearing in newspapers and television networks worldwide.

"CONGRESSMAN Peter King was the staunchest ally that Irish activists could ever have had on Capitol Hill but increasing numbers are now asking if the Long Island politician is stepping back from his commitment on Irish issues. Since September 11 there is no question that King has been deeply affected by that day in his native state and it appears that it has brought about a rethink of his priorities. He is now firmly on the side of the most hard-line elements in the Republican Party who want to limit immigration, increase federal surveillance of groups such as Muslim organizations and take a law and order approach to immigration issues. King is particularly outspoken about radical Muslim groups in the United States and has accused them of refusing to become good Americans and of keeping very anti-American views despite their impressive progress over here. He is noticeable by his absence at many Irish events that he was previously an ever present. There seems little doubt that the issue of terrorism has come to play a huge role in King's political thinking and that the Irish no longer fit neatly into the equation. Not that Peter King needs to apologize for that. Before it was popular or profitable King was the lone voice among American politicians who stood up for Irish nationalism and became a strong supporter of Gerry Adams when other politicians ran a mile. Now however, King appears to be closer than ever to the hard right of the Republican Party and is an outspoken supporter of President Bush. As one of the few Republicans who voted against impeachment essentially on the grounds that President Clinton had stood up for the Irish peace process, King has certainly moved sharply away from that centrist position.

"THERE is growing pressure on the Government to withdraw its invitation to President Bush, who is due to visit Ireland at the end of June. Last week Bishop Willie Walsh of Killaloe expressed his opposition to the visit. Now the leader of the main political opposition party has questioned the wisdom of holding the US-EU summit in Ireland, given the demonstrations it is likely to provoke. The Greens, Labor and Sinn Fein are already opposed to the visit. Members of all three parties are urging people to protest at Dromoland Castle, the most likely venue for the President's stay. Bishop Walsh claimed that President Bush's trip to Ireland will identify the country with brutal oppression in the minds of Muslims. The outspoken Bishop believes that the visit will send out a signal to Muslim countries that Ireland supported the war in Iraq. In the Islamic world it identifies us with what they regard as brutal oppression, he said. I'm not anti-American, he insisted. I feel a great deal of sympathy with the ordinary American people, who have had no say in this war. Meanwhile, the leader of Fine Gael, Enda Kenny, has questioned whether the summit should be held in Brussels instead of Ireland and has expressed fears that it could provoke major demonstrations near Dromoland Castle. Protests have already been organized for Dublin and the summit venue. The Peace and Neutrality alliance, the Irish Anti-War Movement and a number of other NGOs are planning to bring protestors from around the country to the venue on the day the President arrives. Sinn Fein EU candidate Mary Lou McDonald says people should use the visit to register their protest at Bush's foreign policies and the occupation of Iraq. Sinn Fein strongly opposes the ongoing occupation of Iraq, along with the failed US and British colonial policies in the Middle East. We have voiced our outrage at the torture of Iraqi people by the US and British occupation forces. Despite the refusal of the British Government to accept what is actually happening in Iraq, the revelations come as no surprise to people in the North. The British torture techniques exposed in Iraq are similar to those exposed in the torture centers of Castlereagh almost 30 years ago, she said. Labor Euro hopeful Ivana Bacik, has also urged people to protest against Bush. The horrific events in Iraq that have emerged in the past number of days reinforce yet again the appalling consequences of the US-led war, she says. We marched in our tens of thousands in opposition to the war 15 months ago. I would urge Irish people to seize the opportunity to take to the streets again and let their voices be heard against this bloody, senseless war. And she urged protestors not to be put off by the security measures being taken by gardai in Shannon. I was deeply disturbed to learn that the Gardai in Shannon are calling to people's homes requesting personal information. There is no onus on a citizen to divulge this information and it is essential that people are aware of this fact, she insisted. She claimed to have also received reports that some firms in the Shannon area are collating personal details of employees. It reminds me of events that led to the suspension of three Telecom Eireann employees in advance of the Reagan visit in 1984. People should not be intimidated by over-zealous behaviour such as this. Democratic, peaceful protest is our right and we should exercise it during Bush's visit, she said. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (President George W.

"A friend of your columnist was recently in Dublin attending an event at the athletic track at University College Dublin. It was sports school day and his niece was one of the participating athletes. What amazed him was that the majority of the children were either Black or Muslim, reflecting the extraordinary change in the inner city Dublin area in recent times. He saw young girls with the Muslim headdress racing each other in 50 meters sprints and powerful young Black athletes easily overpower their white classmates in long distance races. It was all an indication to him of just how dramatically Ireland is changing at present. Whereas years ago the sight of an Asian or Black person was a cause of wonderment, now it is the rule rather than the exception. THE speculation in Ireland at present is that Bertie Ahern may well become the next President of the European Commission, in effect head of Europe when the job is decided upon in the next few weeks when Roman Prodi of Italy steps down. Ahern has impressed many of the European leaders during Ireland's presidency of Europe over the past six months. The view is that of Ahern succeeds in winning passage of the new EU constitution then he would be a very likely choice. The issue of the new constitution has plagued the EU for many years and were Ahern to solve it it would bring him major kudos. Of course Ahern does not speak French which is a huge drawback but French president Jacques Chirac is said to like him as is Gerard Schroeder in Germany and of course, Tony Blair in England, with whom Bertie has a close relationship forged in the peace process negotiations. If Ahern is interested in the job he will have to show his hand soon as the election is imminent. If he does go for it it would obviously leave the Prime Minister's position open. That would set off an incredible scramble to succeed him. The two favorites would be Foreign Minster Brian Cowen and Health Minister Michael martin. Indications are that it would be a very close race between the two. For Bertie it might be the perfect out. He has been Taoiseach since 1997-a lifetime in Irish politics, and though still a comparatively young man at 52, his popularity is not on the increase. A new vista in Europe might be just what he needs. THE Irish are mad as hell and they want George Bush to know about it. There are plans for major demonstrations against the president during his flying visit on June 26th but the chances are that the president will never hear or see any of the protestors. The secret service has chosen wisely in making Dromoland Castle the location for the EU/U.S. summit. The castle, just miles form Shannon Airport is easily made inaccessible and the massive grounds mean that protestors will not get within an ass' roar of the president. All of which will not deter tens of thousands of Irish showing up to protest the visit and the Iraq policy. Among the more sensationalistic stories appearing about the visit are that the Secret Service can shoot anyone they want if they think the president is in danger and that the Americans will also control Irish air space for a day or so. What is not in doubt is that a massive security operation, the largest in history perhaps will be undertaken around the visit. Already thousands of people who live close to Dromoland are being questioned and their backgrounds researched by police. A massive undertaking it seems. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"There is no doubt that the United States policy on the South Caucasus is hostile towards Armenia. The financial aid received by Armenia from the USA should not divert the real aim of its intent. It is a carrot-and-stick policy except, in this case, the stick is big enough to crush our tiny republic, which is struggling to meet the new challenge of a demanding world. America's silence and the lack of any forceful resentment on its part towards Turkey's unlawful blockade of Armenia prove its negative position. The main Turkish precondition to removing the blockade is to turn Karabagh over to the Azeris, which is supported by the U.S. This is suicidal and unacceptable by Armenia. Continuous support by the US government of the Turkish denial of the Armenian Genocide committed by the Turks (an incontestable historical fact) is an unconscionable act towards the Armenians throughout the world. ANTI-ARMENIAN STANCES The recent visit of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to Georgia and Azerbaijan, while skipping neighboring Armenia, revealed his mission to those republics, to provide military assistance and training, and support unfriendly U.S. relations with Armenia. One may wonder against whom these military preparations are aimed if not against their neighbor - Armenia. The US is quietly building its permanent military bases in Georgia and Azerbaijan even while denying their permanency. Complete silence by the American and British media of the recent brutal cowardly killing of an Armenian lieutenant, Gurgen Margarian, as he lay sleeping, by an Azeri lieutenant Ramil Safarov, while both were attending NATO's organized seminar, Partnership Peace Program, in Budapest, Hungary, is aimed to protect their oily friend Azerbaijan from embarrassment over such a fanatical crime. This cowardly brutal killer, with the victims' blood still on his hands, was declared a national hero throughout Azerbaijan. If such a crime had been committed by an Armenian, the same media would not have spared the time and effort to condemn the entire Armenian nation for the creation of such a fanatical monster. One should not be surprised to learn that the U.S. government supported the New York-based Human Rights Watch condemnation of the Armenian government for insufficient religious freedom in Armenia for international religious organizations and cults to operate freely to convert the Armenian Christians of the Armenian Apostolic Church to their Christian domination. These financially powerful international religious organizations and cults, through their missionaries and their clever businessmen, are taking advantage of the poverty-stricken population with financial bait or promise to the wonderland and converting them to their Christian domination. To any resentment by the Armenian Apostolic Church for such immoral tactics, the Human Rights Watch replied with an outcry that it is contrary to democratic principles. The same Human Rights Watch kept silent when the Azeri government ousted the Christian missionaries from their country, preventing conversion of the Muslim believers to the Christian faith. The above facts clearly indicate the unprovoked negative attitude of the US towards Armenia. US TAKEOVER MOVEMENT OF SOUTH CAUCASUS After the successful overthrow of the onetime good friend of the US, President of Georgia Eduard Shevardnadze and his government by the opposition forces supported and financed by the US and private parties, there emerged a new leader, the pro-American - and, not surprisingly, American - educated - Mikhail Saakashvili, as President of Georgia. His first assignment, naturally, was to demand the removal of Russian forces from Georgian territory, increase in the present American forces, and, of course, joining NATO. Understandably, the Georgian relationship with Turkey and Azerbaijan has markedly increased since the new leader took office. The US plan to convert the South Caucasus into an American camp is nearly accomplished. Azerbaijan's new leader, Dictator Ilham Aliev, son of the late dictator Heydar Aliev, along with the Georgian new leader, devoutly belong to the American-Turkish coalition camp. The mission to have the entire South Caucasus under US control cannot be accomplished until the Republic of Armenia submits to American control, and the Russian military forces, protecting Armenia from a Turko-Azeri invasion, is removed. The time is most suitable to accomplish this goal since most of the Armenians in Armenia are prejudiced against their president, Robert Kocharian, since he is a Karabaghtsi, a native of Karabagh. The public sentiment against him and his government is growing. The opposing forces are blaming him for insensitivity toward public needs, abuse of power, falsification of the presidential elections, corruption, and conspicuous wealth of senior government officials, indicative of rampant government corruption, etc. One should realize that regardless of which government takes over the present government, the abuses will not go away. Only a statesman with a strong patriotic determination and power will be able to eliminate the ill will of the government. Unfortunately, no such leader is in sight. ARMENIAN INTERNAL SITUATION DELICATE The time, indeed, is most favorable for Kocharian's opponents and dark forces to try to overthrow the present legitimate government since most Armenians in Armenia support the removal of a Karabaghtsi from the leadership of their country without realizing the consequences of such an injurious and corrupt coup. The opposition is naively and irresponsibly playing into the hands of the dark forces. Should such an unjustified and harmful coup occur, the emerging winners undoubtedly will be the most financed and organized - the dark forces - supported by the world powers. It will not surprise anyone, should the former president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, emerge as a candidate of the dark forces in view of his consistent Pro-Turkish stand. Russia is undoubtedly carefully watching the American strategy unfold for the final move to bring the South Caucasus under its control. Can Russia prevent America from taking over Russia's last southern bastion, tiny Armenia, when already Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Georgia and Azerbaijan are securely under American control? If Russia fails to keep Armenia under her protection, then the very existence of Armenia and the Armenian nation is in question. It is undeniable that the preservation of Armenia greatly depends on the Russian protective military forces. If our people are naive enough to believe that the American control of their country will bring prosperity and security to our nation, then they do not comprehend the self-interest of the world powers. The flowing charity money should not mislead the real intended purpose. It is nothing else than a bribe to achieve economic and political domination of these countries, unlimited access to their natural resources and economy, control of internal and foreign policies of the governments, even influencing the mentality of the population aimed at destroying their nationalism. MODERN IMPERIALISM The power of the ruling countries is in financial wealth, control, and overwhelming military force. As one may remember, not long ago, the Big Powers' method to control countries and to achieve their interest was in bribing the ruling dictators and ruthlessly extracting natural resources from these countries and to have an easy access to their market. This tactic is still in force where dictatorships still exists and resentment to democracy is still strong. Exploitation by the major global powers did not change; only the method is modified to fit the political state of the world. Their methods are more sophisticated, masquerading as humanitarian, a helping hand, but in reality they are vicious profiteers. They are crueler and more harmful than in colonial times since they threaten the very national integrity of these countries, shaping them into their desired image. The New World Order and economic globalization initiated and vigorously pursued by the US, in spite of growing opposition by affected countries, is in full swing, assuring the world powers grip over, and control of, the world economy and finances known as imperialism, the ultimate level of capitalism. For centuries, religion has been an instrument in the hands of the governing forces to control and suppress the population. Just like religion, in this 21st century, the word democracy is misused to successfully control countries and nations. Under this powerful political device, countries have become invisible modern colonies of the world powers. PROBABLE CONSEQUENCES OF PRO-AMERICAN GOVT. IN ARMENIA If a pro-American government in Armenia succeeds, then the following events under US pressure are expected to take place: - Nagorno Karabagh will be handed over to Azerbaijan, followed by the massacre of the Armenians and the exodus of the remaining population. - Replacement of the Russian forces by NATO forces. To have the Turkish government suppress the Armenians, NATO is expected to have overwhelming multitudes of Turkish and Azeri soldiers on Armenian soil. Usually NATO forces utilize whorehouses to satisfy their sexual needs. One should ask, whose parents are to deliver their daughters to these houses? - The puppet government of Armenia, under democratic rule, will not be able to prevent the Turkish and Azeri ownership of properties and businesses in Armenia. With specially planned and financial backing by the US, these countries may easily take over Armenia, forcing the final exodus of the Armenian people, being gradually replaced by Turkish and Azeri bashibozooks (hoodlums). This is not an illusion or a bad dream, it can and will happen if our nation chooses the wrong partners, whose interest intends to undermine Armenia's prosperity and survival. Armenia is facing two choices: either stay neutral by cautiously and protectively cooperating with the US, not joining any anti-Muslim coalition, and never give up their mutual defense pact with Russia, or submit to the American-Turkish rule that eventually will destroy Armenia and the Armenian nation. It is about time for the silent majority of Armenians to speak up, to act with a strong united and decisive voice, to block the violent actions of the presidency-seeking opportunists and lead the country for a secure and rightful existence among nations.

"While the aggressive minority opposition in Armenia continues their destructive efforts to undermine the coalition government and to unseat President Robert Kocharyan, very important political events are reshaping around the Caucasus region. These ambitious and misguided opposition minority leaders, blinded by their thirst for power and full of hatred for Kocharyan, may be ignorant not to see these important unfolding international events or they consider their personal interests above those of the nation. According to international news agencies, Iran and Armenia signed an agreement to construct a 140-kilometer-long natural gas pipeline that will transport Iranian gas to Armenia. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh and Armenia's Energy Minister Armen Movsesyan signed this historic agreement during a ceremony in Yerevan on May 13, 2004. The estimated cost of the project is $210 million dollars (it will cost the Armenian side $90 million, and the Iranian side $120 million), and already China, Ukraine and EU expressed their possible interest and readiness to finance and participate in this important project. Russia and the U.S., due to their own strategic considerations, are cool to project and are even raising objections in private. The above-mentioned countries' attitude toward the project is a reflection of their geopolitical and perceived national security concern. ARMENIA-IRAN PARTNERSHIP FOR GAS To elaborate, it is obvious for Armenia that the project means energy independence and economic prosperity. Instead of depending solely on Russia for energy and Georgia's goodwill for transportation, Armenia will deal with friendly Iran until an alternative energy source is in place. Iran is eager to implement projects due to several reasons. These include economic gain; under the agreement, Iranian gas will be paid through a barter system. Iran is eager to export natural gas to the Georgian, Ukrainian and European markets if their gas pipeline in future extends to the port of Batumi and Poti in Georgia. Iran is also trying to boost Armenia's political standing in the Caucasus to counterbalance the increasing Azeri-Turkish-Georgian collaboration supported by the U.S. Iran, with its 25-million Azeri-speaking population, is very much worried over the ever-increasing Azeri-Turkish nationalism and prospect of Pan-Turkish expansionism. Russia is in a constant retreat in Caucasus and Central Asia, and lost its influence in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and even in Kazakhstan, where Russians used to constitute 40 percent of the population, which today has dwindled down to 20 percent. Russia is not in an economic, military or political position so far to challenge U.S. supremacy in the region. For Russia, tiny Armenia remains one of few bastions where their presence so far is not challenged yet it is being disputed by some vocal Armenian opposition figures. Maintaining a military base in Armenia and so far preventing the Azeri-Turkish axis to swallow Nagorno Karabagh, Russia is serving its national geopolitical interest. RUSSIAN OVERTURES By maintaining a presence in Armenia, the Russians are hoping to influence the future events in Georgia and Azerbaijan. Recent events proved that Russia's power is dwindling in Ajaria, where American-trained President of Georgia Mikhail Saakashvili, with tacit U.S. approval and support successfully chased out longtime Russian ally Aslan Abasidze who took refuge in Moscow. After acquiring ownership of Armenia's energy production facilities under Armenia's debt in exchange for property agreement, Russia is now trying to penetrate Armenia's banking industry and already Russia's big Vneshtorgbank is expanding its activity in Armenia. It is very significant that, after his second-term election, Russia's President Vladimir Putin's first foreign meeting was with President of Armenia Robert Kocharyan. Sensing Kocharyan's difficulties with aggressive minority opposition in Armenia, Russia made several goodwill yet threatening gestures. The Russian side is now copying traditional American foreign policy methods and using both carrot and stick. While Russia is offering Armenia economic investments, joint economic ventures, cooperation in science, education, health care and banking, and military assistance and security arrangement, it is also forcing the issue of implementation of the cooperation reached by Russia and Armenia in all spheres. There is limited space here to go into detail but obviously Russia is not happy with President Kocharyan's complementary policy to accommodate and appease both the U.S. and Russia. Armenia's cozy relations with NATO and the U.S. under the Partnership for Peace Program and, in particular, Armenia's recent agreement with the Pentagon to share logistical facilities in one another's territory in times of emergency, are not being well received in Moscow. Russia is also looking at the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline construction deal with this perspective. Moscow wants to keep Armenia dependent on the giant Russian energy distributor Gazprom. If Armenia develops alternative energy sources, this may lessen Armenia's dependency on Moscow. Obviously tiny Armenia, surrounded by hostile Azerbaijan and Turkey and undependable Georgia, cannot afford to downgrade its strategic political and military cooperation with Russia. US DISSATISFACTION WITH ARMENIA The U.S. is not very happy with President Robert Kocharyan and is critical of Armenia's foreign policy. Washington considers Iran a rogue state and wants to isolate Tehran internationally. The U.S. is against Iran-Armenia gas pipeline deals, and is against any Iranian role in the Caucasus. The U.S. is promoting the BTC line (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline) project that has more geopolitical than commercial value and perceives the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline project as a rival project with export potential to Georgian, Ukrainian and EU markets. Washington is trying to promote Turkish-Armenian reconciliation, persuade Ankara to open the Turkish-Armenian borders, and convince both Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders to compromise in the Karabagh dispute. Washington is hoping to attract the Caucasian states of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan to the Washington-Ankara-Tel Aviv axis, in order to neutralize the influence of Russia and Iran once and for all. The continued hostilities of Ankara and Baku against Armenians, their refusal to recognize the Armenian Genocide, and their taking uncompromising stands in the Karabagh negotiations are complicating America's plans in the region. Washington recently sent U.S. National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice to Moscow to establish common ground with Russia as to how to deal with regional security issues, including war in Iraq, Iranian nuclear energy development, ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus and, in particular, how to dissolve the Karabagh issue. REGIONAL REACTION TO RICE'S VISIT TO MOSCOW It is interesting to read the Azeri interpretation of this visit. According to Azerbaijani political observers, Russians sold Ajaria (Georgian Autonomous Republic) to Americans and Washington sold Karabagh (Karabagh Autonomous Republic) to Moscow. Russian first Deputy Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Trubnikov asserted, Russia does not want non-regional powers (the U.S.) to be present in the territories of the former Soviet Union. The U.S., in turn, asserts that they do not want Russia to interfere in the internal affairs of the former Soviet republics. China is not a world power yet but has the potential to become an economic power. China's interest in Armenia is very interesting. China, in the past, bolstered Armenia's defense by providing military equipment and Silkworm missiles. Now it wants to support the Iran-Armenia gas pipeline project and joint economic ventures with Armenia. China is uneasy with the nationalistic sentiments of its Muslim population in the Uighur Sinkiang province, where Turkish-speaking separatists are seeking independence. China is also wary that the U.S. is trying to enlarge the scope of its influence through global supremacy. China sees Armenia as an important region to prevent further Turkish-American penetration in the region. (Even India appears to be trying to support Armenia because it is concerned about Islamic fundamentalism and because Pakistan has a close relationship with both Turkey and Azerbaijan.) APPROACH OF EUROPEAN UNION The European Union (EU) has already voiced its support for Iran-Armenia gas pipeline projects. EU is concerned about the potential danger from the aging Armenian Metsamor Nuclear Station, realizing that Armenia needs to look for alternative energy sources. EU has a more pragmatic approach to regional issues; in particular, it has different approaches to the problems and conflicts in the Caucasus between Georgians, Abkhazians and Ossetians, and between Armenians and Azerbaijanis. The European Parliament's Special Reporter on South Caucasus Per Gorton angered the Azeris when he suggested that Baku reconcile with the fact that Karabagh is not going to go-under Azeri control. Europeans are also suggesting to the Turks to reopen the Turkish-Armenian border and to address the Armenian genocide issue. The EU wants to expand its membership to Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan and has a positive and constructive approach as to how to deal with opposition-government disputes and the democratization process, and to sort out socioeconomic problems. The European Union, in contrast with the approach of the U.S. and Russia, appears to be mostly interested in regional stability, cooperation, and integration of the region to EU. Unlike the U.S. and Russia, EU countries are avoiding the creation of a sphere of influence or rivalry with other players. OPTIONS FOR ARMENIA AND NAGORNO KARABAGH Naturally, what happens to Armenia in this contest is of great concern to the Karabagh Armenian leadership. Ten years have passed since the signing of the Bishkek cease-fire agreement on May 12, 1994, when the warring parties - Azerbaijan, Nagorno Karabagh and Armenia - agreed to stop fighting and talk around the negotiation table. No war or peace situation is preventing further economic and social developments in the region. The revitalization of the Paris and Key West spirit and recognition of the Karabagh Armenians' right to self-determination, handing four Azeri districts back to Azerbaijan, in turn, and opening railway links between Russia and Armenia via Azeri territory, while maintaining Armenian control over Lachin, Kelbajar and Shushi seem to be the only alternatives. Azerbaijan should abandon sovereignty claims on Karabagh, Lachin, Kelbajar and Shushi, and Armenians should abandon plans to keep the entire occupied Azeri territory under their control. Armenia's foreign policy goals are exactly along these lines - to solve the Karabagh dispute with a package deal, as stated, and reject the step by step approach, as preferred by Azerbaijan (namely, to release occupied Azeri districts first, then negotiate the status of Karabagh later). Since the geopolitical priorities of Iran, Russia, and America are separate from one another, and their approach to Caucasian matters remains contradictory and competitive, it is up to the Armenian nation to decide how to deal with the challenges presented. For this, the first step should be reconciliation between the opposition and the coalition government, to work together within the spirit of national unity; otherwise, both government and opposition will become prey to foreign meddling in their internal affairs, and they will all lose.

"On April 29, 2004 a rare event took place at St. Mary Armenian Apostolic Church here. Ragip Zarakolu, a remarkable Turkish intellectual, spoke to a capacity crowd on a range of subjects, including the Armenian Genocide, censorship in Turkey and problems surrounding the publishing of books, as well as the current human rights situation. Zarakolu runs the Istanbul-based Belge International Publishing House, which he founded in 1977 along with his late wife, Ayse Nur Zarakolu. He has been a consistent and principled critic of successive Turkish governments, especially with regard to the dismal human rights situation in Turkey. The Zarakolus' dedication to freedom of expression led them to find the Turkish Human Rights Association. It has also landed them in jail several times, and the hardships of prison directly contributed to the untimely passing of Ayse Nur. Zarakolu, a prominent figure in Turkish intellectual circles, began his lecture by providing some autobiographical information, detailing his human rights work and resulting imprisonment in the early 1970s. It was at this time that he realized that if the Turkish government were capable of such brutality in the 1970s, the Ottoman Empire was certainly capable of much worse during World War I. He noted that the current system in Turkey, just as in the past, could not survive without an enemy, whether minority, leftist or Muslim, and that for the sake of democracy in his homeland, this state mentality must change. His anguish over fee situation in Turkey led him and his wife to start an international publishing house in 1977, which published in 1991 the first book on the Kurdish Question, entitled International Colony Kurdistan by Ismail Besikci. The government responded by imprisoning the author and preventing the distribution of the book by the publishers. But this response was mild in relation to the reign of terror that was then sweeping Turkish Kurdistan. Zarakolu estimated that nearly four thousand Kurdish villages were burned down and approximately three million Kurds relocated, accompanied by the assassination and kidnapping of many Kurdish intellectuals. This war of attrition and extermination reminded Zarakolu of the Armenian Genocide. The comparison between the Armenian Genocide and the ethnic cleansing of the Kurds prompted the Zarakolus to translate and publish Yves Ternon's book on the Armenian Genocide, under the appropriate title Ermeni Tabusu (The Armenian Taboo). This book, too, was confiscated and banned. Ayse Nur Zarakolu, in an absurd turn of events, was put on trial as the author of the book and sentenced to two years in jail. Ragip Zarakolu noted the irony that, at the same time as Ayse Nur was being prosecuted in Turkey for discussing the Armenian Genocide, the distinguished scholar of the Middle East, Bernard Lewis, was being sued in a Paris court for denying what Lewis himself had previously termed the Armenian Holocaust and subsequently was found guilty. The Zarakolus were determined to challenge the authorities in the name of freedom of expression by translating and publishing in book form Vahakn Dadrian's lengthy article on the Genocide, which appeared in the prestigious Yale Journal of International Law. This book, too, was confiscated and the publishers arrested. This time, however, they were acquitted by a Turkish court, which was fearful that drawing attention to a work published in such a prominent journal would undermine the government's denialist position. Emboldened by this success, the Zarakolus translated and published Franz Werfel's famous novel, The Forty Days of Musa Dagh. The Turkish government allowed its publication, partly because it was a novel and partly because it did not want to draw more attention to the issue of the Armenian Genocide. Such successes came with a heavy price, but as Zarakolu emphasized: No doors will open without a struggle. And struggles there were. In 1994, the publishing house was burned down and the inventory largely destroyed, forcing him and his wife, along with their supporters, to go underground in order to continue the struggle. Currently, the Turkish government tries to prevent distribution of his books through the use of economic pressure, such as taxation and frequent auditing. But Zarakolu remains optimistic and cited as an example the fact that he has just published a collection of Professor Dadrian's most important articles on the Armenian Genocide. He strongly believes that he has a responsibility to Turkish society, which has been grossly misinformed, especially the younger generation. Zarakolu also feels a responsibility to the Armenian community of Turkey, which also does not have a good grasp of its own history. Due to a pervasive fear that it is not safe to pass on information from one generation to the next, the Armenian community of Turkey has been denied its past. It is through books such as those published by Belge that Turkish Armenians have begun to rediscover their identity. He stated that he is in constant touch with leading members of the community in Istanbul and is alarmed by the threats that they have received from Turkish fascist organizations. According to Zarakolu, there are possibly up to one million people in Turkey who either are of Armenian descent or are Armenian converts to Islam. He argued that they have a right to learn their history and should have the honor and privilege of knowing their heritage. Zarakolu also feels that he is no longer alone in this struggle. He noted that a decade ago, he was essentially alone, but that now the ranks of those Turkish intellectuals who want to reconcile with the past are growing. Turkish intellectuals are offended by the propaganda of their own government and are no longer satisfied with the state dictating what they are to believe. He ended his formal presentation with a moving poem in Turkish, entitled Gul Kirimi, or the Rose Massacre. During a lengthy and enthusiastic question-and-answer period, Zarakolu elaborated on some of the points in his presentation and also fielded inquiries on a wide range of subjects. The first question was related to the motivations of people like Ragip and Ayse Nur Zarakolu, to which he provided an answer by stating that there are two essential factors in his own development. The first is the fact that he was born in Buyukada (Medz Gughzee) and other multicultural neighborhoods of Istanbul, in which Armenians were neighbors and not viewed as enemies. The second factor is related to the experiences of Zarakolu's generation, which came of age in an era of state terror, which made it easier for them to sympathize with the plight of the Armenians and the minorities in general. It is difficult to overestimate the courage and moral fortitude of Ragip Zarakolu and his late wife and steadfast partner, Ayse Nur Zarakolu. Ayse gave her life to the cause of freedom and Ragip has suffered tremendously for his beliefs. Armenians, Turks and all those dedicated to the defense of truth and human rights owe a debt of gratitude to Ragip, Ayse Nur and their colleagues. We can only hope that the day will come when people like Ragip will not be persecuted for daring to question. Rev. Fr. Vertanes Kalayjian, during the course of his introduction of the guest speaker, asked for a moment of silence in honor of the late Ayse Nur Zarakolu for her courage and dedication to the cause of human rights.

"WE live in the global village. So here in Ireland we have been looking at the shocking pictures showing American soldiers mistreating naked Iraqi prisoners just as people around the world have. When powerful images like this appear they are flashed round the globe in an instant and they are on TV screens everywhere within hours, including ours. The international reaction to these pictures has been revulsion. And the reaction here in Ireland has been much the same as it has been elsewhere - dismay, disgust and deep disappointment that Americans could behave in this way. During the Gulf War the U.S. authorities were not happy with some of the TV coverage. This time around they were determined that it would be different, so the Iraq war has seen the media corralled and kept far away from the action. The aim was to control the message going out. So it's ironic at this stage after the war that tiny digital cameras carried by soldiers, rather than big TV cameras carried by reporters, have now caused the U.S. such grief. Inexperienced reservists, thousands of prisoners, pressure for interrogation results, digital cameras and e-mail ... it's a dangerous mix. The pictures we have seen in the past week, with a second lot from The Washington Post, have done greater damage to the Americans than any suicide bomber could. Used in this way, a tiny digital camera can be a weapon of mass destruction...destroying an entire country's image. The latest pictures, including one of a prisoner being led on a leash like a dog, are as nauseating as the ones published a week earlier. Even supporters of the American involvement in Iraq (like myself) will feel that this is a strange way of introducing democracy and respect for human dignity to this unhappy part of the world. The fallout from this is potentially enormous. We now know that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld knew something about what was going on in the jails in Iraq months ago, yet took little or no action. We are also being asked to believe that he forgot to tell President Bush, who is reported to be annoyed as a result. Rumsfeld may yet be forced to resign. The bottom line is that this is now way beyond a mere embarrassment. It is doing untold damage to America around the globe, and particularly in the Muslim world. The pictures of Muslim men being degraded by a female American soldier is, in their eyes, the ultimate insult. We may not agree with this perception of women, but that's their belief. The whole disgusting mess is also Manna from heaven for the anti-American lobbies everywhere. But, although this humiliation of Iraqi prisoners is totally unacceptable, some of the equivalence with the Saddam regime that has been suggested in the media on this side of the Atlantic is out of proportion. The facts are that (apart from the millions he murdered on the outside) Saddam murdered thousands of people in custody. Brutal, sadistic torture, rather than humiliation, was an everyday reality in his jails. There are around 8,000 prisoners now being held in 14 separate jails in Iraq by coalition forces; only a few deaths have occurred and they are being investigated. Yes, prisoners in Iraq have been held for months with no access to a legal system. Yes, it seems that a great many of them are ordinary Iraqis who are deemed to be a security risk for often vague reasons. Yes, the regime in the overcrowded prisons and detention centers has been rough. And yes, there have been numerous complaints about mistreatment of prisoners, especially in the Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. But so far there is little hard evidence other than the pictures, and we have yet to learn exactly what was going on when they were taken. Reprehensible though the behavior of the American soldiers seen in the pictures seems to have been, it is important to keep a sense of proportion about what may have happened. Iraqi prisoners have been humiliated physically, and in some cases sexually, that much is clear. Over the weekend we saw pictures of a prisoner who appears to have been savaged by a U.S. Army dog. And Rumsfeld has warned us that much worse is to come, describing some of the unseen pictures as sadistic. There may also be videos. But so far - and I stress so far - we do not know how much real torture has taken place. We know that a new get-tough policy was being implemented from last August when General Miller (then in charge of Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo) was sent to Baghdad by the Department of Defense to improve the flow of intelligence. His report recommended that all interrogation around Baghdad should be centered in Abu Ghraib, with a special interrogation unit of guards and a general softening up program to encourage prisoners to talk. This seems to have been accepted by the Department of Defense. So the new get tough policy was official - but the big question is whether the soldiers we have seen in the pictures were following or exceeding their orders. The techniques they used to soften up prisoners before interrogation are not new - stripping, hooding, sleep deprivation, sexual humiliation. They are a violation of human rights. But these techniques, or ones very like them, have been used in many places before, including Northern Ireland. It's inhuman and degrading treatment. But is it torture? The word torture is being used repeatedly in reports in the media here describing the pictures. But whether one can call all of what we are seeing torture is questionable. In fact there is a quantum difference between this kind of mistreatment and the kind of extreme cruelty normally categorized as torture, the sort of stuff that was happening in Abu Ghraib when Saddam was in power. It is very easy - and perhaps unwise at this stage - to make assumptions about exactly what the pictures we are seeing imply. If prisoners were being tortured as opposed to being humiliated or abused, where are the cracked jaws, blackened eyes, bloody heads, whip marks or burn marks from electric shocks? Where are the broken bones and badly bruised bodies? The International Committee of the Red Cross, which visits prisoners held by coalition forces in Iraq, has said in the past week that it repeatedly urged the U.S. months ago to take corrective action at the Baghdad jail where these pictures were taken. But the Red Cross did not comment publicly on conditions at the prison at the time, only doing so when the pictures were published two weeks ago. If it believed at the time that extensive brutal torture (instead of mistreatment and humiliation) was taking place, would it have remained silent? There is also the obvious fact that although a week separated the publication of the two main batches of photographs, the same female reservist is in both sets of pictures. If this unacceptable behavior was as widespread as is now being suggested, why so? How come there are not other U.S. troops in pictures? Close examination of the pictures we have seen so far in my view does not support the allegations of extreme torture that have been made. They are not pleasant to look at. There is real fear in the eyes of the prisoners. But there are few signs of serious injury. Does handcuffing a prisoner to cell bars constitute torture? Does forcing groups of naked prisoners to lie on top of each other or to simulate sex constitute torture? It may be disgusting and degrading, but it does not fit with the usual definition of what brutal torture means. Only one of the pictures seen so far - that of the hooded man standing on a box with wires attached to his hands - indicates torture in the normal sense of the word. We have been told that he was led to believe that if he fell off the box he would be electrocuted. But we don't know how accurate this is, or how long he was on the box, or if he was simply posed there because it made a good picture, like the picture of another prisoner with female underwear over his head. It is easy to jump on the anti-American bandwagon in all of this and many commentators on this side of the Atlantic have done so, swayed by the power of the images we have seen. And swayed by the perception that the American involvement in Iraq is becoming a bigger mess with every day that passes. But anyone who thought that bringing democracy to a tribal and feudal country like Iraq was going to be easy was fooling themselves. It was always going to be extremely difficult. With so many U.S. soldiers being killed over there and the situation getting worse every day, it's not really surprising that there was pressure for better intelligence to try to contain the problem. The failure which led to this mess really seems to have been the assumption by the Bush regime that, after September 11, any behavior is permissible, and the percolation of that attitude via Rumsfeld's Department of Defense all the way down to the Abu Ghraib guards. The point is, of course, that while we may accept such behavior from tyrants like Saddam, it's not acceptable from the troops of the Land of the Free. It is a tragedy that it has happened, not only for the unfortunate Iraqis who have suffered but also for all the decent U.S. soldiers whose good name has been dragged in the mud. Over the last few weeks when we were on holiday in Florida, I spoke to many ordinary Americans who, uncertain though they are about the U.S. involvement in Iraq, still carry the burden of the conflict there every day with great dignity They do so even as they are full of fear every moment for what may happen their sons, daughters, fathers, wives. While we were there a local soldier was buried, hardly more than a boy. The grief of the entire community was palpable. The We Support Our Troops banners were flying proudly on many buildings. The funeral report and obituary filled two pages in The St. Petersburg Times the next day. I became conscious then that the same thing is happening all over America every week now. Yet this enormous sacrifice has been forgotten by people in Ireland, indeed all over Europe. That is the bigger picture. And it is now submerged beneath the scandal of the smaller pictures we are seeing from Abu Ghraib. It is worth remembering at this difficult time that the reasons America went into Iraq in the first place were honorable, and that the most recent opinion polls showed that a majority of Iraqis are still glad that Saddam has been removed, even if they are unhappy with the progress of stabilization and reconstruction in their country. If we are looking for scapegoats here, we should lay off the misguided reservists who posed for these pictures and concentrate on the superior officers and private contractors who were driving the effort to extract information from prisoners, but failing to ensure proper standards were followed.

"Dr. David R. Marples is a professor of history and director of the Stasiuk Program for the Study of Contemporary Ukraine at the University of Alberta. The author of 10 books, his latest publication, released on April 21, is The Collapse of the Soviet Union, 1985-1991 (Harlow, Essex: Pearson Education-Longman, 2004). On May 1, 10 nations became full-fledged members of the European Union, raising the EU's overall population by 105 million, and expanding its area by about one-third. What are the likely results of this expansion for Ukraine? The EU has existed in some form for over five decades, originating in Paris as the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. Thereafter it expanded in waves, in 1957 with additions to the original five countries (Italy, Netherlands, France, Germany, Belgium and Luxemburg); 1973 (Britain, Ireland and Denmark); 1986 (Spain and Portugal); and 1995 (Finland, Sweden, and Austria). Certain countries that logically should be a part of a European alliance have remained steadfastly outside it -- Norway and Switzerland being the most obvious examples. Two others are poised to join in 2007, providing that they meet the relevant criteria: Romania and Bulgaria. Another would like to join but has been spurned thus far: Turkey, with a Muslim population of over 67 million, is not yet regarded as a stable democracy. Turkey is not the only state outside the commonly known geographical borders of Europe to express a desire to join. Several others, headed by Israel and the states of the Caucasus, have also indicated their interest. The EU is already a vast bureaucracy ruled from the Belgian capital of Brussels. In theory, it is a potential powerhouse with a combined economy larger than that of the United States. But it is far from cohesive. Britain, which joined only after a bitter referendum, is currently experiencing another national debate on whether it should adhere to the EU Constitution. The two countries that have kept the European Union afloat are France and Germany. Once traditional enemies that went to war twice in the 20th century, they are currently close partners and allies under Prime Ministers Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroeder. They have recently found common ground with Russia in opposing the war in Iraq. The leadership of France and Germany provides the key to understanding the EU: some partners are more important than others. The large countries will often meet privately to discuss major issues. What, then, is the advantage to joining? The answer is financial aid, subsidies, adherence to a single set of rules for trade and tariffs, and a common economic zone free from visa restrictions. What are the criteria for joining? The EU insists on the so-called Copenhagen Criteria: member countries should enjoy a stable democratic environment with a working market economy, and meet the standards of EU law. Decisions inevitably are somewhat arbitrary. But, in general, the 10 new members meet those stipulations. The largest new member is an ancient European state, Poland, with a population of 38.6 million. The smallest are Cyprus (the Greek part of the island) and Malta. The rest comprise states that had Communist or Socialist regimes for most of the post-war period: the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary and Slovenia. The new members present some interesting social and demographic issues. Ethnic Russians make up between one-quarter and one-third of the population in Estonia and Latvia. The latter country is the poorest of the 10 nations. Two countries -- Slovakia and Hungary -- have manifestly failed to deal with the dire economic plight of Roma Gypsies, a group that is anticipated to make up 10 percent of Slovakia's population within the next decade. Slovenia is the first EU member from the former Yugoslavia. All the new members are poorer than the existing ones. The current and prospective expansions (possibly including Turkey) will likely satiate the EU and bring with it a series of perplexing problems. In the short term, none of the new entrants can expect many benefits. In turn, the various countries offer varying degrees of political stability. Romania and Hungary, for example, like Turkey and Bulgaria, have long had serious disputes over ethnic nationals in the other's territory. Established members like the Netherlands and Britain already are discussing the establishment of strict quotas on immigrants and migrant workers. It also is unlikely that the sort of generous subsidies that led to the economic growth in recent years in countries like Ireland will continue in the future. The expansion has also caused much bitterness in those countries left outside the new borders. Writing in the Financial Times (April 30), former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev took issue with a statement by entrepreneur George Soros that Russia had spurned democracy and should always remain outside the EU. Ironically, Cyprus, one of the main business partners for Russian oligarchs, has gained entry without difficulty. In Ukraine, opposition leader Viktor Yushchenko is fighting an election campaign based on providing a viable campaign for his country's entry into the EU in the near future. In his view, the complaints of President Leonid Kuchma that the EU has failed to come up with a constructive entry program for Ukraine are unjustified. He maintains that it is the Kuchma regime that has stymied Ukraine's prospects through its authoritarianism, restrictions on the media and corruption. However, Ukraine and Russia (along with Kazakstan and Belarus) have also taken steps toward forming their own common economic space. They have little choice, since there are no prospects for entry prior to 2010, and some EU leaders have expressed their views that even long-term membership for these countries seems far-fetched. Should Ukraine celebrate the expansion of the EU? Perhaps it should -- though for symbolic rather than material reasons. For most of the countries, May 1 marked the return to a world that seemed little more than a dream during the years of Nazi German and Stalinist tyranny, through war-fare, deportations and repression, and the indescribable dreariness of living in a Soviet-style command economy. No country has suffered more in this regard than Ukraine, which experienced (along with Belarus) the full brunt of the two most destructive wars in history, not to mention civil war and man-made famine. The past two years have seen both Ukraine and Poland revisit some of the more painful events of the war years. The questions discussed -- the events in Volhyn in 1943 and Akcja Wisla -- elicited widespread debate at the highest levels. It was possible to conduct such an open debate between two post-Soviet countries dealing with issues of their national histories and self-perception. But now the old Soviet border between Poland and Ukraine is now the new border between the EU and Ukraine. It is not an event that seemed likely 12 years ago. The EU, both implicitly and sometimes explicitly, holds the view that Ukraine's development since independence has left a country with significant prospects mired in political conflict and corruption, one in which there has been close collusion between the political leadership and powerful oligarchs from the industrial towns scattered along the Dnipro and Don rivers. Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, the former boss of the Donetsk region, is a classic example of the oligarch/bureaucrat that has given Ukraine such a bad name. The political situation in Ukraine is little short of a tragedy in terms of Ukraine's international prospects. That tragedy would be compounded if, following the May 1 expansion, the EU does not make some sort of positive gesture toward Ukraine, and in particular toward Our Ukraine and Mr. Yushchenko personally. If the door is firmly shut, then the prospects for Mr. Yanukovych as a candidate for president in the October 31 election would be enhanced considerably. The elusive so-called multi-vectored foreign policy of President Kuchma might conceivably be replaced by the one originally advocated by Mr. Kuchma in his first presidential campaign 10 years ago: moving closer to Russia. Ten years ago, such a policy did not seem outrageous. Russia had embarked on shock therapy, and while Russia and Ukraine had significant disputes in the Crimea and over oil and gas deliveries, they were not insuperable, as evidenced by the 1997 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the two states. Russia in 2004, however, is a very different prospect. Moreover, President Vladimir Put in, his power firmly consolidated, has made no secret of the importance of Ukraine to Russia (even going so far as to suggest that the two Orthodox Churches be merged during a recent visit to Kyiv). Russia may have been willing to make concessions on Central Asia and the U.S. military presence in this former Soviet borderland. No such compromises will be forthcoming on Ukraine. And the ramblings of Mr. Gorbachev do not make a serious case for Russian membership of the EU. The Russian path lies outside the community. Ukraine's prospects should not be painted uniformly black. The EU, as we have noted, is far from monolithic. It may also improve its relations with both NATO and the United States independently of the EU. Ukraine has experienced significant economic growth (though from a very low base point), and it has strong opposition voices that have widespread electoral support -- in contrast to both Belarus and Russia. Nonetheless, May 1, 2004, a day celebrated across central Europe, is unlikely to please -- and should even alarm -- those concerned with the development of democracy and prosperity in Europe's largest country.

"In the worst outbreak of violence since the cessation of hostilities five years ago, ethnic Albanians torched Serbian homes and churches in mid-March as Kosovo convulsed in bloodshed since war officially ended in the southern Serbian province, now inhabited mostly by Albanians, in 1999. War in Kosovo ended after NATO airstrikes halted former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian militants seeking independence. Ethnic Albanians have since mounted periodic revenge attacks on Serbs. Fighting erupted in the divided city of Mitrovica on March 18 after a protest over the drownings of two Albanian youhts. A third boy was reported missing, and a fourth boy, who had been with the group, said he and his friends had been chased into the Ibar River by a group of Serbs with a dog. Interviews with the boy were broadcast on local Albanian-language television channels, and thousands of Albanian men subsequently gathered in Mitrovica to protest the deaths. The protesters blamed Serbs for the deaths (at press time, the Albanian allegations were still unconfirmed). By nightfall the United Nations had lost control of several city centers, and mobs of Albanian men were attacking Serbian areas at will. In the provin-cial capital, Pristina, machine gunfire and explosions could be heard late into the night. In response, Serbian nationalists set mosques elsewhere on fire and threatened to retaliate with slaughter and death. NATO sent reinforcements to quell tensions in the U.N.-run province and ease the threat of renewed conflict in the volatile Balkans. In Belgrade, the capital of Serbia-Montenegro, demonstrators set the city's 17th Century mosque on fire after clashing with police. A mosque in Nis, Serbia's second-largest city, was also torched. GREEK PEACEKEEPERS The clashes killed dozens of people and wounded hundreds more, including more than 60 U.N. police and NATO peacekeepers. The violence also impacted Kosovo's Greek peace-keepers. The Athens News Agency reported that American helicopters detected suspicious moves by ethnic Albanians in the Urosevac region of Kosovo at noon on March 18, near a small church guarded by Greek peacekeepers in that area. Greek soldiers reportedly took heed of U.S. warnings and quickly abandoned the region just before the ethnic Albanians attacked the small church in Mitrovica and burned it to the ground. According to ANA, 15 Greek soldiers guarding a church in Mitrovica were attacked by 1,000 Albanian demonstrators that afternoon. The demonstrators threw a hand grenade at the Greek soldiers, resulting in the destruction of an armored vehicle and minor burns to the face of one Greek lieutenant. The soldiers who were attacked later withdrew to safety following the intervention by a 100-man Greek contingent which went to their aid, ANA reported. Upon sight of the Greek contingent, which rushed to the area with ten armored vehicles, the Albanian demonstrators dispersed. The Greek peacekeeping contingent in Kosovo has since stepped up security measures, ANA reported. The reinforced Greek contingent guarding the church after the attack, along with the few Serbian families living in the area and a U.S. company, returned to the base of the 525th Mechanized Battalion the following morning. American soldiers specialized in riot control started guarding the church, as did police officers from the Ukraine. The Serbian families were transferred to the region's U.S. army base. The Greek contingent was expected to resume its mission once order has been restored in the area. In a statement by Foreign Ministry Spokesman George Koumoutsakos on March 18, the Greek Government categorically condemned the hideous acts of violence in Kosovo and encouraged all the sides to continue efforts for the consolidation of peace and democracy. Mr. Koumoutsakos also said the full implementation of U.N. Resolution 1244 is an essential precondition to safeguard peace, stability and democracy in Kosovo. The bloodshed has underscored the bitter divisions which have polarized Kosovo's mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians, who want independence from Serbia and Orthodox Christian Serbs, a minority in Kosovo who consider the province their ancient heartland. ATTEMPTED POGROM The breakdown in order also illustrated the failure of U.N. and NATO efforts to defuse ethnic hatred. Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica angrily denounced the attacks on Serbs as an attempted pogrom, although he later called on Serbs not to respond to violence with more acts of violence. The province is U.N.-administered but remains part of Serbia, with its final status to be decided by the United Nations. Ethnic Albanians are frustrated that the international officials who rescued Kosovo from Milosevic have failed to deliver on what for them is the only issue: independence. You can see a form of independence being negotiated in a new and violent way without the Serbs and the international community, said Alex Anderson of the International Crisis Group in Kosovo. We are entering an incredibly dangerous time now.

"A significant number of Armenians living in America are adopting the practice of circumcision - a procedure that historically has not been a custom among Christian Armenians. The following is an article based on the review and analyses of books, research papers, articles, as well as personal interviews with physicians, literary figures, human rights activists, and members of the Armenian and Jewish communities. I also collected data from day care centers and practicing Armenian pediatricians, which revealed a 30-40% circumcision rate among Armenian children. (The national incidence with U.S. males is 60%.). The practice of circumcision among Armenians serves no religious purpose and is mainly performed for hygienic reasons. Some parents have been victims of negligent doctors who circumcised children at the hospitals without the parents' informed consent. Others have been solicited by hospital staff, and have fallen prey to the institution that promotes the procedure for financial reasons. Still other people in our community seem to want to assimilate to the dominant American culture by embracing its custom of circumcision. While routine circumcision of male infants has been a much-debated issue in the US. for many years, it is now being questioned in an unprecedented way. Nonetheless, it remains an especially uncomfortable topic of discussion among most Armenians: The subject of circumcision, however, is a rather complex multidimensional social issue that ought to be discussed from the perspective of history, culture, religion, and medicine. It is also a sexual and human rights issue. In short, it requires the attention of medical professionals, lawyers, educators, ethics scholars, and religious leaders. Their collective knowledge and expertise would contribute a sound foundation upon which we can begin raising awareness regarding this controversial cultural introjection that has been neglected for far too long. ORIGINS OF CIRCUMCISION Despite the common belief that circumcision was invented by Jews, it is known from history that it originated in different areas of Africa and dates back at least 5,000 years, appearing in Egyptian representations of Pharaonic times. Thus, both Jews and Arabs learned circumcision in Egypt. An array of explanations for the motives behind the practice has been offered by historians, anthropologists, and other scholars. As described in Circumcision of Male Infants Research Paper (Queensland Law Reform Commission. Brisbane, 1993), the roots and motives of circumcision are barbaric and cruel. In fact, circumcision is believed to have been applied as a castigatory measure, and as a mark of slavery. Some anthropologists also speculate that circumcision is attenuation of human sacrifice, relating it to the practice of cutting off the entire penis, which was offered as a sacrifice to the gods, or were used as war trophies. Some warriors offered the genitalia of their enemies as trophies to the girls they chose to marry. Other interpretations of the motives of the practice have been: rites of passage, tribal integration; gender identity; desensitization of the sexual organ to moderate sexual activity, and thus, to perfect morality; cultural assimilation, as well as hygienic and medical reasons. I will narrow down my discussion on the sexual aspect of the procedure, assimilation and acculturation issues, as well as the claimed hygienic and medical reasons. Moses Maimonides, the famed 12th-century Jewish rabbi, physician and philosopher, wrote in his book The Guide of the Perplexed (University of Chicago, 1963) Part III, Chapter 49, Page 609: ... with regard to circumcision, one of the reasons for it is, in my opinion, the wish to bring about a decrease in sexual intercourse and a weakening of the organ in question, so that this activity be diminished and the organ be in as quiet a state as possible. ... this commandment has not been prescribed with a view to perfecting what is defective congenitally, but to perfecting what is defective morally. The bodily pain caused to that member is the real purpose of circumcision...The Sages, may their memory be blessed, have explicitly stated: It is hard for a woman with whom an uncircumcised man has had sexual intercourse to separate from him. In my opinion this is the strongest of the reasons for circumcision. MASTURBATION HYSTERIA IN THE VICTORIAN ERA The non-religious practice of circumcision was introduced into secular society and medically popularized in the U.S. and Britain over a century ago in a period of time often retrospectively referred to as the masturbation hysteria. During my interview with Mark D. Reiss, MD, Vice President of Doctors, Opposing Circumcision (D.O.C.), he discussed the origins of circumcision practice in the Victorian era, when it was falsely thought that masturbation caused insanity, epilepsy, paralysis, bed wetting, blindness, asthma, rheumatism, curvature of the spine, alcoholism and criminality. By circumcising, Victorian doctors hoped to eliminate these dreaded diseases and conditions. However, it is now known that circumcision does not prevent masturbation, or the above-mentioned conditions, but rather only serves to make sexual functioning more difficult. MODERN PRACTICE OF CIRCUMCISION In the early 20th century, circumcision was claimed to be more hygienic and became a routine procedure in the U.S. and continued to increase after the mass military circumcisions during WW I, and WW II, and the Vietnam War. During this period, the incidence of circumcision was dramatically increased and reached its peak in 1979, when 85-90% of American boys were circumcised. Circumcision is far less common among other industrialized countries, as well as in the non-Islamic regions of Asia (around 10-15%; Circumcision Reference Library, 2003). The U.S. is the only country in the world that routinely circumcises most of its male infants for nonreligious reasons. Proponents of the procedure cite potential health benefits, such as lowered risk of urinary tract infections (UTI), penile and cervical cancer, human papilloma virus (HPV), as well as reduction of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Conversely, anti-circumcision activists oppose the removal of any healthy, functional part of a human body as a means of disease control. Moreover, the American Academy of Pediatrics states (1999) that ... these data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision and ...there is no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision. Likewise, the American Medical Association (Complete Medical Encyclopedia, 2003) states: There is no medical reason for routine circumcision of infants. In fact, no medical organization in the world recommends routine circumcision of infant boys. Many have specific statements arguing against circumcision, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the British Medical Association, as well as the medical associations of other European countries, Canada, and Australia. In the face of the absence of medical indication, circumcision practice continues, and those who promote it certainly gain financially. The American Academy of Pediatrics states that each year, 1.2 million newborn males are circumcised in the United States annually at a cost of between $150 and $270 million. That estimate does not include hospital and nursing fees, medical supplies, and expenses that arise as the result of complications. The primary beneficiary of circumcision, thus, is not the child, not the parent, but the medical community, which is involved in a lucrative multimillion-dollar business. CIRCUMCISION AND HIV The latest renewed attention toward the correlation between HIV/AIDS epidemic and circumcision status comes at a time when claims for medical benefits have been losing stance for decades. Studies claim that HIV infection rates are much lower in some West African nations, where circumcision is common, than in some South and East African nations, where circumcision is rare. However, since most of the circumcised men in the study are Muslim, it is unclear whether circumcision status or variables like sexual behavioral patterns typical of Islam play a role in the protective effects. Secondly, the U.S. has one of the highest circumcision rates among the industrialized nations and also the highest HIV rate. Obviously, circumcision did not protect Americans from HIV infection. On the other hand, circumcision rates are low in Europe, as are HIV infection rates. The American Medical Association (Report on Neonatal Circumcision, online) has stated, Regardless of these findings, behavioral factors are far more important risk factors for acquisition of HIV and other sexually transmittable diseases than circumcision status, and circumcision cannot be responsibly viewed as 'protecting' against such infections. Marilyn Milos, the co-founder and director of National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC), wrote to me in her email letter, The scare tactics are always consistent with the dreaded disease of the times. There was a penile cancer scare in the '30s; a cervical cancer scare in the '50s; and the sexually transmitted disease scare of the '60s. WHERE IS MY FORESKIN? Does the foreskin have any function at all, or has evolution failed? Didn't evolution determine that the male mammals' genitals be an internal and not an external organ, sheathed in a protective foreskin? Is a foreskin just a dead piece of skin? Is it nature's defect? In his article The Case against Circumcision (Mothering Magazine, Winter 1997), Dr. Paul Fleiss writes that most American textbooks do not even mention the foreskin and illustrate the human penis circumcised, as if that is its natural state. Millions of years of evolution have fashioned the human body into a model of refinement, elegance, and efficiency, with every part having a purpose, writes Dr. Fleiss. Furthermore, he explains that the foreskin is an essential part of human sexual anatomy, containing greater concentration of blood vessels and nerve endings than any part of penis. The foreskin, he explains, is a uniquely specialized, sensitive, and functional erogenous organ of touch. The foreskin removed by circumcision represents about 80% (depending on the circumcising doctor) of the penile skin. Dr. Fleiss concludes that circumcision denudes, desensitizes, and disables the penis. It also destroys nature's design of the double-layered sheath that facilitates the gliding mechanism during intercourse. Garry Harryman, the coordinator for the Southern California chapter of the National Association of Restoring Men, writes in his article titled What is Lost to Circumcision: Contrary to pseudo-medical myth, the natural penis with its foreskin intact is not defective or dangerous and does not require urgent surgical correction. Through four thousand millennia of trial and error, Nature has perfected human sexuality as a physical collaboration between two exquisitely complementary designs. The vagina was not designed to accommodate a dry, keratinized, and immobile penis. He calls circumcision a mutilating radical sexual surgery euphemistically called 'male circumcision.' [Infant] circumcision requires that the surgeon tear the skin from the sensitive glans to permit removal. Dr. George Denniston, President of Doctors Opposing Circumcision (D.O.C.), explains in his interview, As a result, scarring occurs, the surface of the glans thickens, and keratinization occurs. Dr. Denniston's advice is to leave the foreskin to fulfill its several functions. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics pamphlet on Care of the Uncircumcised Penis; Guidelines for Parents, follows: Care of the uncircumcised boy is quite easy. Leave it alone is good advice. External washing and rinsing on a daily basis is all that is required. Do not retract the foreskin in an infant, as it is almost always attached to the glans. Forcing the foreskin back may harm the penis, causing pain, bleeding, and possibly adhesions. The natural separation of the foreskin from the glans may take many years. Many parents, whom I talked to explain their choice of circumcision with claims of cleanliness. However, what makes us humans think that part of our body is not clean, and needs further modification? In the above-mentioned article, Dr. Fleiss writes: The white emollient under the child's skin is called smegma. Smegma is probably the most misunderstood, most unjustifiably maligned substance in nature. Smegma is clean, not dirty, and is beneficial and necessary. It moisturizes the glans and keeps it smooth, soft, and supple. Its antibacterial and antiviral properties keep the penis clean and healthy. Forcibly retracting and washing a baby's foreskin destroys the beneficial bacterial flora that protect the penis from harmful germs and can lead to irritation and infection. The child's foreskin, like his eyelids, is self-cleansing. In fact, according to Dr. Denniston, the foreskin is there to protect the glans from the exposure of feces and urine in the infancy. With circumcision this protection is gone. Penile hygiene will later become a part of a child's total body hygiene, the American Academy of Pediatrics states, including hair shampooing, cleansing the folds of the ear, and brushing teeth. At puberty, the male should be taught the importance of retracting the foreskin and cleaning beneath during his daily bath. COMPLICATIONS As with all kinds of surgery, circumcision has some risks. Here are some of the complications of circumcision from the report of the American Medical Association, (1999). Bleeding and infection, occasionally leading to sepsis, are the most common adverse events requiring treatment reads the report. Other untoward events can result from taking too much skin from the penile shaft causing denudation or rarely, concealed penis. Other postoperative complications include formation of skin bridges between the penile shaft and glans, meatitis and meatal stenosis, chordee, inclusion cysts in the circumcision line, lymphedema, hypospadias and epispadias, and urinary retention. Case reports have associated circumcision with other rare but severe events including scalded skin, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis and meningitis, urethrocutaneous fistulas, necrosis (secondary to cauterization), and partial amputation of the glans penis. There is no data as to how many deaths a year occur as the result of circumcision. Circumcision kills an unknown number of U.S. infants every year, writes Gary Harryman. The cause of these deaths, he continues, is a fact the billion-dollar-per-year circumcision industry willfully obscures and conceals...Every year boys lose their penises altogether from 'botched circumcisions.' They are then 'sexually reassigned' by transgender surgery and must live their lives as females. Obviously, any potential benefits of circumcision are far outweighed by its risks and drawbacks. Dr. Vigen Zargarian, an Iranian-Armenian pediatrician in practice for 27 years, has dealt with the circumcision issue throughout his long experience in pediatrics. I have seen many circumcision procedures performed both in Iran and the U.S., explains Dr. Zargarian in his interview. I have seen a child die in 24 hours from gangrene and sepsis caused by necrotizing fasciitis (flesh-eating bacteria), right in front of my eyes. BEHIND CLOSED DOORS Most parents are ill informed about the short-term and long-term effects of circumcision on the child. Dr. Zargarian explained how the typical circumcision procedure is carried out in American hospitals. As usually performed without analgesia, circumcision is very painful, says Dr. Zargarian. In fact, children feel excruciating pain, and local anesthetics are not effective enough, he explains. This procedure is agonizing; the powerless child is taken away from his parents, stripped naked, and put on a 'circumstraint' board. His arms and legs are fastened tightly with straps. The whole scene looks like a crucifixion. In fact, research shows that, during circumcision, the infant withdraws into a state of neurogenic shock (coma), due to sudden massive pain, which in fact is misinterpreted as being quiet or falling asleep. (Dr. George Denniston, Circumcision Quiz, online). Parents should know what lies ahead for their tiny infant, insists Dr. Zargarian, and the best way to educate them about this procedure is to have them watch a video. (The two films that are highly recommended are: It's a Boy! and Whose Body, Whose Rights) However, the idea of observing a circumcision is not acceptable to many parents. Meanwhile, the baby has to undergo a procedure his own parents cannot stand to watch. If parents have a chance to ever observe the procedure, Dr. Zargarian adds, I am almost certain that they will not let their child go through it. Circumcision Resource Center (Mothers who Observed Circumcision) reports the numerous testimonies of mothers who have observed circumcision. One mother writes: The screams of my baby remain embedded in my bones and haunt my mind. She added later, His cry sounded like he was being butchered. I lost my milk. Here is how a mother felt after circumcision of her son: It was as close to hell as I ever want to get! Another mother shares her deep feelings of regret: My tiny son and I sobbed our hearts out...After everything I'd worked for, carrying and nurturing Joseph in the womb, having him at home against no small odds, keeping him by my side constantly since birth, nursing him whenever he needed closeness and nourishment - the circumcision was a horrible violation of all I felt we shared. I cried for days afterward. A mother noted that she still felt pain recalling the experience about a year later. She wrote to her son: I have never heard such screams...Will I ever know what scars this brings to your soul? ... What is that new look I see in your eyes? I can see pain, a certain sadness, and a loss of trust. A DIFFERENT KIND OF PENIS ENVY Very often, parents explain their choice of circumcision by appealing to the concern that their intact sons would be ridiculed by their circumcised peers in the locker rooms. It is most ironic that, instead of educating our children about the importance of our unique cultural and individual identity, we, ourselves, as parents, fall prey to the peer pressure. Another common factor for the choice of circumcision is the father's circumcision status. Parents argue that they do not want their child to feel different from his father. This like-father, like-son syndrome is widely applied by all groups in the U.S., including Armenians, and it is even viewed as family tradition. At other times, it is the older sibling who has been circumcised, so the younger brother is circumcised, too. However, is there any necessity that all the males in the household have similar penises? After all, as some human rights activists say, boys do not undergo plastic surgery when they are a day old to make their noses look like those of their fathers. In fact, the National Organization of Restoring Men offers an opportunity to circumcised fathers to look like their intact sons. These are non-surgical stretching techniques for foreskin restoration, which can be partially effective in restoring the lost sensitivity of the glans by rejuvenation of the keratinized skin. BAPTIZED AND CIRCUMCISED? CIRCUMCISION ISSUE IN THE HISTORY OF CHRISTIAN ARMENIANS For centuries, circumcision has been a crucial issue in the lives of Armenians. Leaving their children intact was a significant aspect of ethnic identity and religious association among Christian Armenians. Living under Islamic domination, the preservation of this identity was continuously at stake. It is known from history that the Turkish government led systematic and coercive policies to convert Armenians to Islam. In his book, Turkish Documentary Sources about Armenians, the historian Avetis Papasian writes that, after 1464, Armenian boys were forcefully taken away from their families by the Turkish government. This plan of ethnic cleansing was a real menace for Armenians living in historic Western Armenia. Every two to five years, representatives of the Turkish government would gather physically fit and healthy boys between eight and twenty years of age. Then they would be transported to Istanbul where Armenian boys were made to ceremonially take an oath to convert to Islam. These children then were ritually circumcised and given new Turkish names. Eventually, these Armenian males would receive military training and were brought up as fanatic followers of Islam. The 17th-century historian Arakel Davrizhetsi [of Tabriz] writes in his History about the heroic deaths of Christian Armenian youth who resisted conversion to Islam, which was always accompanied with circumcision, and chose death instead. These youth were venerated as saints among Armenians of those times. During my interview with Stepan Topchian, an Armenian author and literary figure, he voiced his concern about this new cultural phenomenon. Circumcision status, Dr. Topchian explained, was one of the distinctive features of our ethnic and religious identity. He stated that it took a lot for our forefathers to resist any attempts of forceful assimilation. Today, they would be amazed at how easily we abandon an important tradition central to our national identity. He calls for Armenians to be more prudent and responsible in preserving this heritage that has come all this way, only to be jeopardized for no valid reason. It is rather disturbing to witness that a few decades of American reality proved more potent than centuries of threat of coercive assimilation. In one of his email letters to me, Gary Harryman wrote, Of all the horrors that have been visited upon Armenians in the last century, I hope circumcision was/is not one of them. From the perspective of our Christian heritage, it is essential to acknowledge that there is an inherent fundamental conflict in baptizing and, at the same time, circumcising our sons. Let us remember what Paul said to his followers: In him [Christ] you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by Christ, having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead... (Col 2:8 & 11-13.) Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, Christ will be of no value to you, at all. Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace... (Gal... 5 v. 2-6) As part of my efforts to raise awareness about our Christian heritage, I call for our religious leaders of the American-Armenian community to come forward and bring their authoritative involvement in this most urgent issue. JEWS AGAINST CIRCUMCISION We are educated and enlightened Jews who realize that the barbaric, primitive, torturous, and mutilating practice of circumcision has no place in modern Judaism, reads the homepage site of the organization Jews Against Circumcision (JAC). Since ancient times, Jews suffered the grim consequences of circumcision, which claimed the lives of their infant sons. In fact, Jewish law allowed the families to forgo circumcision of the third son, if the family had already lost two previous children as a result of circumcision. More and more Jewish people are rejecting the controversial ceremony and are not afraid to question tradition that is in conflict with common sense, and basic human rights. I mourned my own circumcision, Dr. Reiss told me in a most candid interview. Of Jewish heritage, Dr. Reiss never questioned this tradition until later in life, when he discovered that any potential benefits of circumcision are far outweighed by its risks and drawbacks. Jewish people are now leaving their sons intact, as they view circumcision as a part of Jewish law that they can no longer accept, he explains. In fact, according to Dr. Reiss, there are proportionately more Jews fighting against circumcision (as compared to their population size in the U.S.) than non-Jews. He holds that it is not the Jewish but the American culture and its medical institutions that are promoting the circumcision industry in the U.S. He states that, among Jews in Europe, South America, and even in Israel, circumcision is not universal (only 40% of newborn Jewish boys in Sweden are being circumcised). HUMAN RIGHTS: THE ULTIMATE ISSUE The various cultures of the world have practiced religious and secular rituals that infringed on the bodily autonomy of the individual, including female circumcision, infibulations (stitching together the labia to prevent intercourse before marriage), sterilizations, human sacrifice, feet binding, body piercing, cutting off the fingers as a sign of mourning, and other mutilations. As average Westerners, we watch National Geographic films about male and female circumcision rites in Africa and, with our typical ethnocentrism, label them as primitive, unclean, and brutal. We assume that what happens in American hospitals is scientific, sterile, and humane. Nonetheless, human rights activists argue that, regardless of the place and style of the procedure, both male and female circumcisions are genital mutilations and violations of the child's right to an intact body. No one, says Dr. Denniston in his interview, and especially not a doctor has the right to remove normal body parts from another individual (mutilation by definition). Nor do they have the right to torture that individual. Some parents resent the procedure because it involves genital manipulation by the circumciser, which they think strips their sons of their innocence. As Marilyn Milos put it in her interview, Circumcision is where sex and violence meet for the first time, and it imprints the connection between the brain and the penis with pain instead of the pleasure that organ is meant to feel. Unfortunately, the proponents of circumcision either avoid or trivialize discussions of such important aspects as psychosexual trauma associated with routine neonatal circumcision, the degree of pain, and human rights issue. The research paper on Male Circumcision: Pain, Trauma and Psychosexual Sequelae (Journal of Health Psychology, May 2002, Boyle, G., Goldman, R., Svoboda, S., Fernandez, E.) views circumcision as a procedure that involves an imbalance of power between perpetrator and victim, contains both aggressive and libidinal elements, and threatens a child's sexual integrity by amputating part of the genitalia. Involuntary neonatal circumcision is described as an experience of violence and powerlessness - inflicted by other human beings. Many adult men who recognize the importance of the irreplaceable part of their body that has been removed without their knowledge or consent tend to manifest feelings of resentment and emotional suffering. As cited by authors, avoidance of the topic of circumcision, or obsessive preoccupation with such a loss is typical of the circumcised individual. The article also discusses the so-called I'm circumcised and I'm fine syndrome, which is a common attitude of the circumcised father, who unreasonably insists on the circumcision of a son in the face of contrary evidence. Dr. Paul Fleiss discusses the psychological mind-set of the circumcised father and explains how to best overcome these feelings. A circumcised father who has mixed feelings about his intact newborn son may require gentle, compassionate psychological counseling to help him come to terms with his loss and to overcome his anxieties about normal male genitalia. In such cases, the mother should steadfastly protect her child, inviting her husband to share this protective role and helping him diffuse his negative feelings. Most parents want what is best for their baby. Wise parents listen to their hearts and trust their instinct to protect their baby from harm. The experience of the ages has shown that babies thrive best in a trusting atmosphere of love, gentleness, respect, acceptance, nurturing, and intimacy. Cutting off a baby's foreskin shatters this trust. LEGAL REMEDIES Today, lawyers and human rights activists raise the issue of limiting the parental right of consent for this procedure. The American Academy of Pediatrics clearly states that there is no absolute medical indication for routine circumcision. By this reasoning, parental consent for this surgical operation, which is neither diagnostic nor treating a disease, is not legitimate. Circumcision can always be performed in adulthood with fully informed consent for those individuals who desire it, says Dr. Zargarian. I always tell parents, let the child grow up and decide for himself. Do not assume that he would want to be circumcised and remove a healthy, functional, and most importantly, a private body part. Furthermore, the Code of Medical Ethics prohibits a physician from advising unnecessary medical or surgical treatment. Thus, the practice of circumcision is de facto in conflict with medical ethics. As Dr. George Denniston pointed out in his email letter, Armenians are one of many minority groups who never before dreamed of removing half the skin from their son's normal penis, who have been betrayed by the American medical profession. David Llewellyn, who is the Director of the Atlanta Circumcision Information Center as well as a practicing attorney, calls for parents, whose children have been victims of wrongful circumcision, to enforce legal rights on behalf of their child. He holds that lawsuit is the only potent way to stop physicians and institutions from misinforming or soliciting this unnecessary procedure. (Legal Remedies for Penile Torts, The Compleat Mother, 1995). Little do the doctors know that today's helpless infants that they are now circumcising may grow up to become potential plaintiffs of tomorrow. As the number of lawsuits arising from circumcision is growing, so is the number of the states who have ended Medicaid funding of routine neonatal circumcision. Arizona, Missouri, North Carolina, Montana, Utah, Florida, and Maine have joined California, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, and Washington in not funding neonatal routine circumcision. The history of circumcision reveals a chronicle wherein the motives of the practice have been continuously changing, consistent with the times and the beliefs of people practicing it. From assign of slavery to a mark of social prestige, to its medical popularity, circumcision has been and remains one of the most controversial procedures. As members of a society that places high value on the rights of its citizens, we should question circumcision regardless of our religious and cultural backgrounds. Today's society should ultimately be guided by sound science, common sense and respect for basic human rights. The myths surrounding circumcision are inconsistent with our values and beliefs. Circumcision is not clean, it is not fashionable or prestigious, nor is it medically necessary. If you believe in evolution, it contradicts evolution. If you believe in God, than cutting off a part from God's creation is a disbelief. Circumcision does not belong to Christians, it does not belong to Armenians. It is not humane, and it is not what our children are asking for. Ultimately, circumcision is against any parental instinct. Circumcision is irreversible, concludes Dr. Zargarian. I call for parents to be more considerate and responsible in their decisions! Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.","Vardanyan, Astrik",Armenian Reporter International,2004-04-24,1
"As Armenians worldwide enter a solemn week of commemoration of the Armenian Genocide of 1915, the terrible events that shook apart Armenian families three generations ago are occurring again elsewhere in the world. I am referring to the Genocide currently taking place in the Sudan. As in 1915, this Genocide is being reported in the world press including The New York Times. World leaders are aware of it, yet little is being done to prevent it, in spite of the fact that the Sudan is a poorly armed nation that could, comparatively speaking, easily be contained or disarmed. The Sudanese Genocide is being committed in an organized and systematic way by the government of Khartoum, which is arming Arab Muslims known as Janjaweed in order to wipe out the entire black Sudanese population, which belongs to several different tribes and which is also Muslim. Samantha Power, in a recent New York Times piece entitled Remember Rwanda, but Take Action in Sudan, notes that as little as 10,000 troops would be needed to avert this genocide. Yet, as in Rwanda, where the world once more stood still and watched Hutu militias brutally murder 800,000 Tutsis, nothing is being done. Thirty thousand Black Muslim Sudanese have already been murdered, with 700,000 still trapped in Darfur awaiting the same fate. How do these current events relate to Armenians and their struggle for continued recognition of the 1915 Armenian Genocide? By all means, the events should be remembered and set in historical stone. We should fight as hard as we can with whatever means that are at our disposal not only for recognition, but for all sorts of restitutions, ranging from insurance policy payouts to the rebuilding of Armenian monuments and monetary compensation from the Turkish government. Part of the difficulty that we experience as Armenians in this struggle is the sense that we have of being alone on the one hand (Jews have their Holocaust, Cambodians their own, etc.), and of being up against overpowering force on the other (namely Turkish and Western interests in the Middle East). Yet when we speak about the Armenian Genocide of 1915, whether it is in books by Armenian authors or statements by civic leaders, clergy or our very successful lobbies, we almost never mention the other 1.5 million Christians killed by the Turkish government. In fact, the Pontic Greeks and the Assyrians, two people as ancient as the Armenians, were also wiped out from Anatolia. Similarly, I have yet to read statements from Armenian leaders, whether in the Diaspora or in Armenia proper, denouncing the killings in the Sudan. The coming weeks are crucial to preventing the genocide in the Sudan from spreading. Khartoum is continuing to arm the nomadic Janjaweed against their rival African tribes. If the West does not intervene, the remaining 700,000 African tribesmen will perish, tracked down and gunned down in cold blood, for no other reason than their ethnic background. What can we, as civilians, do to stop this terrible Genocide from taking place? We can write our Congressmen and Senators and demand that the United States intervene militarily or otherwise and that we impose maximum sanctions on the Sudan; that we make Khartoum understand that the repercussions for what they are currently doing will make the Sudan a pariah nation for decades to come. We can demonstrate in front of the Sudanese Mission to the United Nations or, barring that, organize protests at the UN itself. We can also call our own Armenian lobbies and insist that they too lobby vociferously to have the Sudanese horrors ended immediately. To say that we do not have the resources to help others or that it takes away from our own vested interests as Armenians is to advance precisely the same types of arguments that led to the world turning a cold shoulder during our own national tragedy. Let us make sure that we at least do our best in the coming months to show that we have learned something from the past about empathy and reaching out. If we do not begin to support others in their darkest days, then we should not expect others to support us in our own. Meanwhile, there is never a dull moment back in Armenia. This week, Robert Kocharian made it clear that any attempt by the opposition to mount a second Velvet Revolution similar to the one that brought Sakaashvili to power in Georgia last month would be met with the harshest reprisals. Armenia is not Georgia, Kocharian stated and, later on: The authorities in Armenia are stronger... we have the means to counter any coup attempt. These last statements came in the wake of anti-government demonstrations in Yerevan and Giumri, in which anti-democratic arrests were made. These last statements by Kocharian boost the arguments of those who see Kocharian as an authoritarian who will stop at nothing to keep the presidency. It is hard to evaluate Kocharian's reign. Armenia has survived changes and events that would have felled other, weaker nations (war, earthquake, blockade, economic collapse), yet it has failed to achieve prosperity or anything resembling self-sufficiency. So it is difficult to know just how much Kocharian's policies are to blame for Armenia's current situation. Armenia, as everyone knows, is in a precarious state. Industry and tourism are just starting to take off and international aid is slowly being converted now into job-forming initiatives. Slowly, some of the over one million people who have emigrated in the past decade are returning. And not far away, in Azerbaijian, in anticipation of Baku-Ceyhan dollar windfalls, the drums of war are beating again. The last thing Armenia needs now is a coup d'etat. However, if the will of the people is so strong that it demands a change of government, if the past decade of ineptitude and corruption has finally made the people of Armenia say NO MORE and mean it, then that will must be obeyed. What type of reflection can it possibly be on the Armenian nation if neighboring Georgia can operate along democratic lines, yet we cannot? On the one hand, we should not forget that Kocharian was democratically elected not once, but twice. On the other hand, it seems that the present government has ignored the will of the people long enough. If Kocharian and his aides cannot pull the country out of its morass, and if the people of Armenia demand his resignation, then perhaps it is time to go. Should Kocharian, however, decide to call in the army to prevent such a coup, then he will be playing into the hands of Armenia's detractors and send a very wrong message about Armenia, its democratic impulses, and its future direction as a people and a nation.

"New York: New York's United States Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton met privately with His Eminence Bartholemew during his recent trip to the United States. His Eminence placed a high emphasis on meeting Senator Clinton while in America with the purpose in mind to urge the Senator to support increased freedom of the Patriarchate as Turkey awaits membership in the European Union. It is largely believed human rights abuses and religious restrictions have served up road-blocks to Turkey's membership, and His All Holiness believes a lifting of restrictions on the Patriarchate in Istanbul would serve to prove to world leaders that Turkey has entered a new realm of religious tolerance. This is not the first time Senator Clinton and His All Holiness have met. The Senator has been a guest at the Patriarchate in past years. World leaders believe it would be well served to have a Muslim State as part of the European Union and Turkey is the best hope, however, there are several issues which still stand in the way of Turkey's membership. Senator Clinton left the meeting with a clear understanding of the Patriarch's positions and promised to keep a watchful eye on the situation. Article copyright Hellenic Times.

"HAVE you heard about the brouhaha involving Long Island Congressman Peter King? King has refused to apologize to outraged American Muslims for characterizing most of their leaders as extremists who are an enemy living amongst us. King has added: I don't see any need to be politically correct here. The stakes are too high. Now, King's standing as an Irish American is impeccable. He has played a central role in the Northern Ireland peace process, acted as a subtle, complex thinker on tough questions ranging from abortion to labor, and - on top of all that - has published several novels. His latest, Vale of Tears, is about a terrorist attack, and thus prompted some of the comments which have caused this recent ruckus. Still, some people can be forgiven for cringing upon hearing King's comments. On the surface, they seem to echo what many Americans said about Irish Catholic immigrants not so long ago. The Irish, after all, were a religious minority. They were accused of being loyal instead to Ireland or the Pope. Furthermore, Irish Americans were often accused of advocating radical politics which, in the minds of many, were not in America's best interests. For a good example of that, pick up the latest novel by best-selling Irish American novelist and historian Tom Fleming. In A Passionate Girl (Forge), Fleming dramatizes the events surrounding the Fenian invasion of Canada in the 1860s. The plan was to win control of Canada - then an outpost of the British Empire - and pressure the Brits to loosen their grip on Ireland. Imagine a parallel event these days. Imagine immigrants plotting a military invasion of another country on U.S. soil. Indeed, Fleming tells the Irish Voice that the Fenian invasion rankled many respectable leaders in the U.S. The Irish were very much outsiders in America, Fleming said. So, should Irish Americans today be wary of potentially anti-Muslim comments along the lines of Congressman King's? That's a tricky question, says Fleming. First of all, he notes that - agree or disagree with radical Irish politics in 19th Century America - politicians were very much courting the Irish vote. That translated into solid support in some circles for even so extreme a plan as the Fenian invasion. The Fenian flag flew over Tammany Hall in New York for a year, Fleming points out. Even national politicians such as Secretary of State William Seward were egging the Fenians on, in the hopes they would secure Irish political support down the road. True, some elements in even the Irish community eschewed radical politics. The Catholic Church had abandoned that game in favor of a more moderate approach. And yet, Fleming says: There was a feeling among the Irish that said they could never achieve respectability in America until they freed Ireland. Fleming adds: Don't forget, they were still in the aftermath of the Know-Nothing frenzy. Only 10 years before, in the mid-1850s, the Know-Nothings were in control of a number of states. They were really pretty scary people, talking about getting rid of the Irish...blocking further immigration. When you add in the fact that the Irish were just 20 or so years removed from the height of the Famine, perhaps it's not surprising they could amass an army of 20,000 Fenians in the late 1860s to invade a British colony. And I have no doubt (the Fenians) could have conquered Canada. Some might disagree with me, but the British had very few trained troops there. So who knows what would have happened then, Fleming adds. But the Fenian invasion failed, in large part because those powerful Americans who seemed so supportive eventually backed down. They were listening to the Irish in one ear, but in the other they heard the British, who saved some of their most vicious attacks for the Fenians. So, the Fenian invasion ultimately failed. Yet the whiff of disrepute hung around the Irish for decades, certainly up to World War I, when the Irish in America were skeptical of the war effort, displaying little interest in fighting what they saw as a British war. Yet again, their patriotism was questioned. They were putting Irish interests ahead of America interests, it was charged. (Fleming explored this question in his previous book, the excellent non-fiction study The Illusion of Victory.) In the end, no matter where one stands on Peter King's recent comments, it is instructive to remember the Irish themselves have often been seen as the disloyal element in the U.S. It must be added, however, that this was typically the result of anti-Catholicism in the U.S. and ill treatment by the Brits abroad. Can Muslims make a similar case? Perhaps. Let the debate continue. Contact Sidewalks at tdeignan@irishvoice.com. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"My wife and I were fortunate to be invited to attend a showing of the movie The Passion of Christ directed by Mel Gibson, after which a panel of experts and the audience in the theater discussed what was seen. This article does not address the technical aspects of the film. I have seen comments that it appeared obvious to some critics that the actors, all relatively unknown, were reading the Aramaic language used in the film. Perhaps my wife and I do not have a critical eye but we did not notice flaws in the acting, the use of the lost language added a unique touch, and we did not even notice the marginal translations written in English. We read them and accepted the speech as though the actors were speaking in English, I suppose, because we were both so thoroughly engrossed in the movie. BRUTALITY NOT A FLAW When the movie ended, I had to take a deep breath to comprehend all that took place on the screen. This is not a movie for a child to see. The brutality is the grimmest and longest that I have ever seen. Is this a flaw in the movie? I think not. Crucifixion has to be one of the worst means of being put to death, and Mel Gibson was showing people the extent of the sacrifice that God made for the love of His people. It is still beyond my comprehension why the Son had to be sacrificed for our sins, but had the sacrifice been of an ordinary type the impact would not have been significant, nor would His rising from the tomb been as dramatic, at least to the extent of creating a new religion that would shake the world. Yet, this was a movie from which anyone could conclude what one wished. A radical person baptized a Christian may condemn all Jews. A true Christian who understands the love and forgiveness that Christ teaches understands that the Jewish leaders played an important role in Christ's death but certainly not the key role. Other Christians may see nothing but the love of which Christ spoke and the power and mystery of God at work, lifting Christ up from the dead. An overly sensitive or radical Jew may see nothing but anti-Semitism. Some Jewish leaders saw the rabbi Jesus as a true prophet paying for battling against the status quo and Roman power. A Muslim may strengthen his Islamic knowledge that Christ was a prophet, perhaps not on the level of Mohammad, but one of history's great teachers. NO ANTI-SEMITISM Did I see anti-Semitism? No. Indeed, the Jewish leaders advocated Jesus' death but it was Pilate who made the decision and cowardly washed his hands in an attempt to be absolved from the crime. We see at work one of the most infamous acts of scapegoatism. It was not the Jews who mercilessly beat Jesus to the point of stripping skin from his body, spitting on Him, jamming a crown of thorns onto His head that ripped the skin from His forehead. It was not Jews that beat, kicked and plagued Him along the way to Golgotha. To contrary, two lay people showed love and compassion in this movie and both were Jews. One was a woman who offered water but was prevented from giving it by a Roman soldier. And the second was the Jewish man who, initially reluctant, was called upon to carry the cross with Jesus and on the way became compassionate and dared to chastise the Romans for what they did. So, if we want to find heroes, people with whom the moviegoer could relate in this movie, Christ aside, both were lay Jews. PAINFUL ISSUES I Saw a number of issues that were painful. I did not see the garishly dressed Jewish religious leaders as Jews, but as men who abused power for self-aggrandizement. No more, but no less, than the historically later Christian leaders that made a mockery of Christianity and went on killing rampages in the name of Christ. They were no different from the ornately dressed pseudo-Christian hierarchy that sent condemned people to the gallows or to the stake to be burned for a number of trumped-up reasons, solely to enhance the power of whatever church they were a member. In the movie, Pontius Pilate was the epitome of a coward who shirked his responsibilities. He found a scapegoat (the Jews) on whom he could cast his decision to kill Jesus. Thus, the beasts in this movie were the Romans and their unbridled power. My Jewish friend saw in the movie the gas chambers to which Jews were led by the Nazis. My frame of reference was Tzet village, Palou city, Dyarbakir Province in 1915; the village from where my parents and relatives were torn away from their friends, parents and family in a planned diabolical plot through which they were eventually killed. I saw the men murdered and the villagers uprooted from all they knew and loved and sent on the road to their Golgotha. On the way they were raped, beaten, scourged and killed. REMINDERS ON BOTH SIDES I Pained for the Jewish man, who during the comment session after the movie, condemned the movie as another planned hypocritical Christian reminder to non-Christians that Jews supposedly killed Christ. He criticized the continual reminder of the crucifixion as though this was fiction that should be forgotten. This person confused worldly weakness with the distortion of a belief handed down from Christ. He fails to distinguish between the Christian faith and the corruption of it by worldly leaders. Just as the Jewish leaders in the movie who demanded Jesus' death and crucifixion were faulty and poor religious leaders, many Christian leaders have branded all Jews as Christ killers. He asked, why do we have to be subjected to Christ's death over and over? One may ask the same question of the Holocaust. The Holocaust was fact, just as the Crucifixion of Christ was fact and from both there are valuable lessons for humanity, whether one believes that Christ was divine or not. The brutality in the movie was intense. But the scourging of Christ, the whipping that He received, particularly with the leather straps that had iron shards laced in them, was intended to do exactly what was shown in the movie. I doubt that an ordinary person could have endured such brutality for such a long time. Yes, others received shipping from the same barbaric tools. But we are not aware how many, if any, humans ever received and survived such intense and prolonged punishment. This was Mel Gibson's way of showing that the Son of Man had the life of god in Him and only God could take it away and then give it back. This was God at work for a purpose that I think I understand, but the methodology, I repeat, is beyond my comprehension. If Mel Gibson had made the movie less brutal in this regard, I am not sure that it would have had the same impact that caused me to think along the lines indicated above. Mel Gibson presumed that the movie viewer would know quite a bit about Christ. This may be presumptuous and arrogant. But whether one believes, as I do about the divine nature of Christ, whether one believes He was God or not, all peoples who wish to be considered educated need to learn about one of the greatest teachers of all time. This movie is one person's powerful account. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2004-04-03,1
"THERE are a lot of worried people here after Madrid. The question - first being whispered here in the days after the bombs and by the end of last week being asked out loud - is could we be next? Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern may insist that he was always against the war. Certainly his statements on the matter in the Dail (Irish Parliament) were so confusing that it's possible for him to argue that he was. And he can insist that the use of Shannon Airport conformed with the normal access that we give other countries and did not imply approval of or involvement in the American war in Iraq. But no matter how much Ahern may play the innocent, there's no denying the way the Irish government allowed Shannon to be used as a key stopover for hundreds of aircraft and thousands of military personnel en route from America to the conflict in Iraq. And the use of Shannon is ongoing. Al-Qaeda are unlikely to be impressed by Ahern's fine distinctions. On that basis, after what happened in Madrid, Ireland must be considered a possible target. Of course Britain is a much more obvious and high profile target than Ireland, given Prime Minister Tony Blair's unflinching support for the American intervention in Iraq, the role played directly by British troops there and the way Blair has continued to stand by President George W. Bush as the difficulties of occupation and reconstruction have multiplied. After Madrid, security chiefs in Britain warned the public there that an attack on London in the near future is now probable rather than possible. But there's another way of looking at this. Unlike Spain, there's no imminent election in Britain which a terrorist attack in London might influence. Nor is it likely, even if a Conservative government replaced Blair after the next election, that it would significantly alter Britain's position on Iraq and its support for America. So, even if it seems obvious that Britain should be the next target, it may not appear to al-Qaeda to offer the kind of immediate payoff that the bombs in Madrid did. In Ireland, there is another factor in the calculation. There's no imminent national election here either, of course. And it's true that the Shannon link had a very low visibility on the international stage. So one can argue that Ireland is low on the al-Qaeda target list, if it is on it at all. But this other factor is highly significant, and it can be argued that it makes us a more immediate target even than Britain. That factor is the visit to Ireland in June by President Bush for the U.S.-European Union summit, which is happening here because Ireland currently holds the EU presidency. Clearly that offers a much more immediate propaganda opportunity to al-Qaeda. If dozens, maybe hundreds, of people were to be killed by al-Qaeda bombs in Dublin a couple of months from now, say a week before Bush is due to arrive here, would it stop the visit? Probably. Might al-Qaeda calculate that Madrid-style carnage in Dublin would send a message out to all other countries that any visit by Bush might have catastrophic consequences? Possibly. All of which would appear to make us a potential target, which is why people here are nervous. But how real is the threat? Probably very low, given that Ireland is such a small player on the international stage, a tiny independent republic with a non-imperialist past usually seen as a friend in the developing world rather than an exploiter. There are practical reasons as well. Spain and Britain both have large immigrant populations originating in North Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. Many are Muslim and anti-American, and some are supportive of al-Qaeda's terror war against us western infidels. In Britain, for example, the Muslim population is close to half a million and if only 1% of that number are extremists it still amounts to a very significant indigenous threat. Here in Ireland the situation is different. We have a very small Muslim population (a few hundred at most) which would make it difficult for extremists to hide. It is true that several people with direct connections to the al-Qaeda money chain and to an al-Qaeda operation in Canada and the U.S. have been living here, and at least one of them has been a successful asylum applicant in Ireland. These cases made headlines here in the aftermath of September 11, but the numbers are very small and the Irish intelligence services are on top of the situation. So although the huge increase in asylum seekers arriving in Ireland in recent years does not make the job of the security forces any easier, few of the arrivals have been from Muslim backgrounds. Which would make it very difficult for an al-Qaeda cell to hide, find support and operate here. Of course al-Qaeda likes to link up with local terrorists in other countries (although they have yet to do so with any non-Muslim group) and there's always our own revolutionaries, the IRA/Sinn Fein, who are proud of their international links and support for liberation movements around the world. And they have well-established Arab connections, as we know only too well from the amount of arms they shipped in from Libya. The Republicans are opposed to the American involvement in Iraq as, of course, they are opposed to all kinds of terror. (Except their own, which is not real terrorism at all, you know.) We can expect them to be out demonstrating against the visit by George Bush and preaching to Ireland and the world about peace. (Get the sick bag ready now!) But even if asked they are unlikely to offer any support to foreign terrorists operating here - this is their territory, after all. The Shinners are not the only ones getting ready to oppose the Bush visit, of course. Already the usual coalition of dreamy idealists, left over lefties, student revolutionaries from the 1970s who never grew up, anti-globalization nutters and the plain bothered and bewildered are joining forces to demonstrate when Bush is here. There was a preliminary demo last weekend in Dublin that attracted only 5,000, so it remains to be seen how many will turn out to protest in June. One of the unfortunate side effects of Ahern boxing clever on the issue and claiming to be against the war while all along giving access to Shannon to the U.S. is that a strong case for the American intervention in Iraq has never been made here. In fact almost all the voices you hear in the media here were opposed to the war, and are opposed to the continuing involvement. It's yet another example of Ahern failing to give forthright leadership on an issue, so perhaps it's not surprising that so many people here have had doubts about what America is doing. In fact, one year on from the start of the war with Iraq, it is clear that America was right to intervene. There have now been several independent surveys of opinion in Iraq, all of which clearly show that a majority of people there are happy that Saddam, one of the bloodiest dictators of modern times, has been ousted. They remain happy that the Americans ended Saddam's appalling regime, even though they are unhappy that so far the security situation has not been stabilized and unemployment and the economy have not recovered. But overall there can be no doubt that the majority of Iraqis continue to support the American intervention. And the surveys also show that they are optimistic about the future. There is also a growing awareness, both here and elsewhere, of the extent of the sacrifice being made by ordinary American families across the U.S. who every week are losing loved ones in Iraq as remnants of the old regime, religious fanatics and tribal elements battle to prevent the introduction of democracy there. And there is a growing understanding of the immensity of the task being attempted. Given that democracy is something completely new to the people there, the current difficulties are hardly surprising. What should be surprising people here is the willingness of ordinary Americans to put their lives on the line against tyranny and in defense of democracy. The critical importance of the introduction of democracy in Iraq cannot be overstated. That change in Iraq - and the potential spread of democratic values across the region - are truly the only defense we have in the long term against Islamic fanaticism and terror in the west. The lives and the freedom of those deluded and blinkered Irish people who will be out protesting against the Bush visit depend on it, even if they don't realize it. All of that is much more important than the attempt to keep the irrelevant debate about weapons of mass destruction going on. Of course the failure to find any is a major embarrassment. But the fact is that before the invasion many countries, including France and Germany who refused to support the U.S., believed they existed. Saddam did nothing to convince the inspectors otherwise and frustrated their efforts at every turn. And since he thought nothing of murdering hundreds of thousands of his own people, clearly he was capable of any international evil involving biological and chemical weapons which are easy to conceal. The more important point at this stage is that, knowing what we now know about his brutal regime and its mass graves and how pleased the Iraqi people are that he's gone, it should be self-evident to anyone with common sense that the American intervention was correct. It does not require retrospective justification by the discovery now of weapons. In spite of the current difficulties, the reaction now of most Iraqis is justification enough. I'm not an admirer of the Bush dynasty and certainly not of George W. It remains to be seen whether he and his pals will be able to keep their hands off some of the oil contracts. But it's clear that this was never just about the oil. If that had been the case, it would have been far easier for the U.S. simply to do a deal with Saddam and leave him in power.

"On the morning of March 2, 2004, the Second Inter-Religious Peacemaking Forum commenced it work here. Participating in the Forum were representatives of the CIS countries. His Holiness Alexy II, Head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, presided during the meeting. His Holiness Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, delivered his opening remarks to the participants. In his address, the Pontiff of All Armenians expressed his high appreciation for the initiative of Patriarch Alexy, and praised his efforts to establish a corresponding body, the Inter-Religious Council of the CIS. The Catholicos specifically referred to the problems and challenges facing the CIS countries and spoke about possible solutions and methods which would help in their resolution. His Holiness stated in part, Today we have the freedom to practice our religion; faith is reawakening in the hearts of our people. However, our souls are not free from concern, as eternal and universal spiritual values are endangered. These values are the only basis on which new relations between societies, nations, and states can develop and progress. We are witnessing moral degradation, the polarization of society, the destructive results of proselytizing cults, and the proliferation of terrorism and related crimes. Recalling recent terrorist acts and their tragic consequences, each of us can confirm that these are not the objectives or dreams of our nations. Our peoples wish to live in safety and security, and not in an atmosphere of fear and terror. They wish to see their families happy and their homelands thriving and prosperous. They wish to look to the future with faith and confidence. Today we have assembled here to make cooperation, friendship and peace the chosen path in the lives of our nations and states. The paths that are God-pleasing are not armored with guns, cannons and rockets, but rather are protected under God's graces and blessing. Each of us wishes to see his concerns addressed and the difficulties of our peoples resolved. However, in the reality of the current century, those concerns and difficulties, as diverse as they are, are also interconnected. All problems should be solved only by peaceful means, through the respect of rights, justice and law. The Catholicos of All Armenians placed great importance to the mission of the spiritual leaders, noting that they are the sowers of spiritual values. His Holiness stressed that goodwill and mutual confidence are the result of spiritual values, and stated his satisfaction for the initiative of inter-religious cooperation manifested by the authorities of the Russian Federation under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin. Also during the first session, Armen Smbatian, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Republic of Armenia to the Russian Federation, read the message of Robert Kocharian, President of the Republic of Armenia, addressed to the Forum participants. Nearly 200 clergymen from the CIS countries, among them spiritual leaders representing the Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist faiths, as well as state officials, participated in the Forum.

"It is difficult to tell whether Bernard Lewis invented the culture of force or whether he learned from it. He certainly espouses the concept that there is no pain that cannot be eased with a bullet in the right spot. None other than Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz were weaned on what has been called the Lewis Doctrine. It is, in short, that most Moslem countries have failed miserably at modernizing their societies so it is up to the US to use force to put them straight. When the immediate shock of 9/11 began to wear off, some members of the Bush White House considered it necessary to frame or understand the enemy. One wing wanted to find out what caused the attack and felt that if Muslims hate the US, the US should endeavor to educate them about America's true virtue. This group argued that Muslim anger at the US as being decadent and godless was all a misunderstanding. INFLUENCES TOP U.S. CIRCLES The opposite wing in the White House decided that the need to find out why the Muslims hate the US was misplaced. This group had no qualms that the Muslims do indeed hate the US. Many of the key advisers and decision makers were very familiar with Bernard Lewis and he was invited to address the White House staffers, military personnel and members of the National Security Council. Not missing a chance, Mr. Lewis had a private conversation with National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice. David Frum, then a White House speech writer, said that soon after the meeting he noticed President Bush Carrying a marked up article written by Mr. Lewis. Mr. Lewis does not believe that the foe is rational. They are not clashing over interests or ideology but over cultures. According to the Lewis thinking, in the Mideast the US must get tough or get out. The reason is that, for 300 years, the Muslims have been humiliated, as the Christian civilizations in Europe and North America have overwhelmed them economically, politically, culturally and militarily. Thus, he waves the banner of the Clash of Civilizations, made popular by Samuel Huntington, but which was earlier articulated by none other than his truly. So as far as Mr. Lewis is concerned, asking why they hate the US is asking the wrong question. According to this guru of force conquers all, the Muslim world has hated the West for centuries - an emotion that he calls natural. This rivalry between the Christian- and Muslim-dominated worlds has peaked, and Muslims conclude that they are losing. According to Mr. Lewis, the proper question to ask is, why do they neither fear nor respect the US? His answer is because the Muslim culture only respects might and people that do not fear using it. Thus, eight days after 9/11, Mr. Lewis addressed the US Defense Policy Board, of which Richard Perle was the Chair at the time, and he argued that the US must take over Iraq to avoid greater terrorism in the future. Remember, this is only eight days after 9/11 that he argued - not about taking over Afghanistan where the al-Qaeda, Taliban, Osama bin Laden connections were firm, but to get rid of Saddam Hussein and to seize Iraq. LEWIS DOCTRINE BECOMES U.S. POLICY Just before the Iraq invasion, I listened to VP Richard Cheney speak on Meet the Press. My wife wondered why I was taking notes. Mr. Cheney said, I believe, along with men like Bernard Lewis, who is one of the great students of that part of the world, that strong, firm US response to terror and to threats to the United States would go a long way, frankly, toward calming things in that part of the world. In effect, the Lewis Doctrine had become US policy. This is a colonial mindset. It is no wonder, because Mr. Lewis worked with British Intelligence on Mideast issues during World War II, at a time when Winston Churchill labored to hand on to the British Empire. Mr. Lewis taught at the University of London and saw the empire being whittled away. He left England and took a position at Princeton University and influenced those folks we now label neocons that have such a tremendous influence in the Bush administration. Mr. Lewis no longer teaches but the maintains a close relationship with the governments of Israel and Turkey, non-Arabs that, he says, are the only successful modern states in the region. Needless to say, he became a close confidant to Ariel Sharon. He embraces Kemal Ataturk, who suppressed Islam, which is exactly what Mr. Lewis currently advocates. Of course, neither of these states hesitates to use guns when a band-aid might work. He has stated that the Ottoman killing of 1.5 million Armenians was not genocide but an unfortunate and brutal byproduct of war. One must assume that Mr. Lewis is willing to count Iraqi, Afghan, or other Arab casualties in the millions as well, to say nothing about the continuing maiming and killing of American soldiers in harm's way. THE ISRAELI PRECEDENT Mr. Lewis has branded the Arab nations as losers who deserve to be transformed through military intervention. But, so far, the losers in Iraq and Afghanistan seem to be developing more terrorism, albeit local, rather than democracy. Both areas seem to be breeding grounds for terrorism. Ilan Pappe of Haifa University said that Mr. Lewis' contention that cultures can be remade through force contributed to Israel's decision to invade Lebanon in 1982. Mr. Pappe has stated, It took the Israelis 18 years, and 1000 soldiers killed, to abandon that strategy. IF the Americans operate under the same assumptions in Iraq, they'll fail the way the Israelis did. At a conference, Mr. Lewis had some interesting things to say. One of the most enlightening indications about his mindset was his definition as to what should transpire in Iraq. In short, the policy that he espouses he himself called imperialism. One critic of Mr. Lewis has stated that this man has lived so long (born 1916) that he is back encouraging his students that the US must be a colonial power. Mr. Lewis continues to stress assertive US actions around the globe. The question is where next: Iran or Syria? He advocates no soft approach to either. We know that he as had a decisive impact on the short-term policies in Washington. Whether or not his troglodyte thinking has long-term longevity depends on whether his neoconservative loyalists, such as Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith, and Richard Perle, retain their power in Washington.

"The Turkish Government's paramount concern regarding Cyprus has been to prove to the European Union that it is demonstrating goodwill towards a settlement; to thereby bolster Turkey's chances of beginning negotiations for its own European candidacy, which is considered remote at this time (the E.U. is scheduled to decide by the end of this year if Turkey's economic. and political progress is sufficient to warrant even starting negotations for accession in the foreseeable future). On the eve of the recent United Nations breakthrough (see related story, page 1), the National Security Council of Turkey, with the consent of the main opposition party of Deniz Baycal, agreed to accept U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's plan in principle. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayip Erdogan reportedly warned Turkish Cypriot community leader Rauf Denktash that he would be removed from the negotiating process altogether if he makes belligerent statements or leaves the negotiating table. ERDOGAN VISITS BUSH In meeting with President Bush at the White House on January 28, Mr. Erdogan made painstaking attempts to deflect pressure from the Administration's push for compromise. The Cyprus issue was near the top of the agenda, signalling Washington's keen interest in a settlement prior to the Republic of Cyprus's scheduled accession to the E.U. While he was in the Oval Office, Mr. Erdogan indicated, for the first time, that the Turks are willing to accept the U.N. blueprint as a formal basis for negotiation. As it is currently structured, Cyprus's imminent accession to the E.U. would make it very difficult for the Turkish side to negotiate the Cyprus issue with Europe after May 1 because European laws and regulations guarantee, inter alia, freedoms of movement and property. At the same time, if the Republic of Cyprus accedes to the E.U. as is (i.e., without a settlement), it would then become even more difficult for Turkey to pursue its E.U. objectives. It is politically unacceptable for an aspiring E.U. candidate to occupy part of another E.U. member state, not to mention the fact that Turkey's accession, the potential of which is presently limited at best, would need to be ratified by the parliaments of all E.U. countries, including those of Greece and Cyprus. E.U. Commissioner Gunter Verhuegen, who was present for the opening discussions on February 19, indicated that Europe is demanding a settlement which conforms to nothing short of E.U. standards: All parties concerned will work out the details of a final agreement which will meet with the minimum requirements of the European Union, he said. In other words, if the current reunification effort fails, Turkey, which is already mired in immense social and economic instability, will come under even greater international pressure to reform. Just prior to his visit with Mr. Bush, the Turkish Premeir also met with Mr. Annan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, which was held in Davos, Switzerland last month. The U.N. Secretary-General later met with the President on February 3 for the express purpose of discussing Iraq and Cyprus. Two days later, after a series of calls to high-level American, British, Greek, Turkish and Cypriot government officials, Mr. Annan announced resumption of the U.N.-sponsored Cyprus talks and invited both sides to met in New York on February 10. American diplomacy has been a major factor in the whole process. Secretary of State Colin Powell and National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice have been in constant contact with all concerned governments. They also met with National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes President Andrew Manatos, United Hellenic American Congress President Andrew Athens, and Cypriot American leaders Philip Christopher and Peter Papanicolaou on January 21 to discuss American efforts to end the illegal 30-year division of Cyprus. PLAN MUST BE AMENDED Mr. Christopher, President of the International Coordinating Committee - Justice for Cyprus, and Mr. Papanicolaou, President of the Cyprus Federation of America, stated jointly that the U.N. blueprint must be modified: In a new round of Cyprus settlement talks, it is important that the United States does everything in its power to ensure an agreement that is viable, but for that to be accomplished, we believe the Annan plan must be amended, they said. In a statement issued on February 13, the day Mr. Annan declared the Cyprus talks have resumed, Western Policy Center Executive Director John Sitilides stressed caution on the recent Cyprus breakthrough. The Greek-Turkish military tripwire in Cyprus threatens regional stability in the eastern Mediterranean, Mr. Sitilides explained. The United States hopes a reformed Turkey inspires its neighbors to reject fascism, tyranny, and extremist fundamentalism, he added, so Turkey's desire for E.U. accession is a weighty factor in the current reunification effort: The success of Turkey's long-term Europeanization project is critical to President Bush's strategic goal of transforming the Middle East and the broader Muslim world towards liberalism, accountable government, the rule of law, and full human and civil rights for all citizens ... For the American strategy in the Muslim world to eventually succeed, Turkey must become fully integrated into the European Union. In Cyprus itself, the reaction to recent developments was muted. According to Reuters reports, residents of Europe's last divided capital (Nicosia) reacted with a mixture of relief and skepticism to the news that their leaders have agreed to groundrules for relaunching a drive to reunite ... the far wealthier Greek Cypriot south was more cautious than the Turkish Cypriot north, which is looking for an end to its international isolation. But if either or both sides reject the final agreement in their respective referenda, which are to be held simultaneously (under direct U.N. auspices) before the end of April, the Annan deal is off, and any new attempts to negotiate a settlement will have to begin from square one.

"IT'S a Ned Kelly moment - again. According to filmmaker Barrie Dowdall, every 10 years there's a surge of mania about Australia's iconic outlaw. Next month sees the U.S. release of Ned Kelly, a big budget account of Ned's brief life and daring deeds starring Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom. Dowdall, meanwhile, was in Boston last week for the U.S. premiere of his own film, a documentary called Ned Kelly: The True Story. Dowdall is a former horseman turned filmmaker from County Carlow who is slightly bemused to finds he's part of the latest contagious outbreak of Ned Kelly-mania. Shortly after he began research for the joint Irish-Australian project three years ago, along came Peter Carey's Booker Prize-winning True History of the Kelly Gang, the film rights for which were bought by great Irish director Neil Jordan (The Crying Game, Michael Collins). And while Dowdall touts his documentary, hoping to garner TV and film festival interest, the interest in Kelly grows and grows. The subject of the world's alleged first feature film (made in 1906) and countless histories, novels, and movies since then, Kelly is a figure around whom ambivalence continues to swirl, especially in Australia. He is the stuff of myth: an avenging angel in his weird, homespun armor. Indeed, Australia's Robin Hood was no altar boy. Celebrated on postage stamps and an emblem of the Australian Olympics, he's also an unwelcome reminder to Australia of its inauspicious beginnings as Britain's dumping ground for convicts in the 19th century. Ned's father, Red Kelly, was born in Tipperary. Red was transported to Australia in 1841 for stealing two pigs. Ned's mother, Ellen Quinn, came to Melbourne from County Antrim with her family when she was nine years old. At the bottom of the social heap, survival was a precarious business for the couple who married in 1850. In place of Ireland's Anglo landowning class, Australia had its squatters, who had pushed out the aboriginals and claimed huge tracts of land. A corrupt judiciary and police force (80 percent of whom was Irish) maintained the status quo. I realized the story had never been told from its Irish perspective, says Dowdall, supplying his incentive for making the film. The theme of the underdog taking on the authorities is a universal one, but nobody had ever really looked at what shaped him. When the Irish went to Australia they found much the same situation they had left in Ireland. Ned Kelly would have been nurtured on stories of oppression, famine, and failed rebellions. Ned Kelly was born in 1856 near Melbourne in Victoria. As Dowdall's film establishes, his impulsive gestures as a boy - when he was 11 he saved a drowning boy - reveal a generous nature. But soon Ned and his brother Dan were being picked up by the police for one alleged misdemeanor or another. At 16, Ned was sentenced to three years hard labor for receiving a borrowed horse. They were targets, historian Siobhan McHugh says in Dowdall's film. Just the same as a young aboriginal guy can be picked up, just because he's male, or indeed now where young Muslim guys are assumed to be probably having links with terrorism. The incident that shaped Kelly's fate occurred when an inebriated police officer arrived at his mother's house looking for Ned and Dan. The police officer fancied Ned's sister Kate and made a pass at her. In a skirmish that followed he injured his hand on the door latch. Back at the station he reported a tale of resisting arrest. Mrs. Kelly, with her four-day old baby, was sentenced to three years in prison. Ned's offer to surrender in exchange for the release of his mother was ignored. Outlaws now with a price on their heads, the brothers were joined by their friends Steve Hart and Joe Byrne, and in 1878, the four were involved in a gunfight that resulted in the death of two police officers. Mixing vague talk of establishing a republic in East Australia, the boys next carried off a couple of daring raids, sharing the money with friends and supporters, many of whom were arrested and held for months as suspected sympathizers. Following a raid on a bank, Ned left a letter with the bank manager with instructions that it should be published in the local paper. Outlining his story and justifying his actions, the letter was never published. Confiscated by the government, its existence wasn't revealed until the 1930s. Though a diatribe in parts, it's far from an illiterate rant, according to Dr. Eamonn O'Ciardha of Trinity College Dublin, who says the alliterative style of the letter brings to mind the satirical writings of 17th and 18th century Gaelic writers. With a price on their heads equivalent to $2 million today, and a posse of 200 policemen in pursuit, the gang forged their famous suits of armor. Made from the idle ploughshares on the unworked farms of sympathizers who were now in prison, and synonymous with the Kelly Gang legend, in fact, they wore the suits only once. Tipped off about a raid they were planning, the police anticipated them, and in a battle that lasted through the night, the Kelly gang, with the exception of Ned, all died. Ned's last request before he was hanged in 1880 was that his mother be released from prison. She served out her time. Told through a series of interviews, reconstructions, and film clips, Dowdall's account is distinguished, too, by the fact that it received the endorsement of Kelly family descendants, a number of whom appear in the film. Still farming in Australia, and by times vilified for their heritage and hounded by sensation seekers, they have, until now, always refused to participate in the Kelly Gang industry. Having watched An Bothar Fada (The Long Road), an earlier documentary Dowdall made about Irish immigrants in England, they were impressed. They trusted me to present an unbiased account, he says.

"In August of 2003, I visited the Armenian Quarter of Jerusalem to meet with the Patriarch and community leaders, but I could not help spending some time touring the historic sites, and also looking for one of my favorite crafts - the Armenian pottery of Jerusalem. While many Armenian-Americans possess some pieces of Jerusalem pottery, I find it less popular than Armenian rugs, woodwork and needlework, primarily because it's not produced in Armenian. In fact, most of the pieces I acquired before my trip to Jerusalem came from online purchases. Even in Jerusalem, I had a difficult time getting information on the various Armenian potters. Fortunately, I finally discovered six shops, and they did not disappoint. Each had wonderful handmade pottery made exclusively by Armenian families. They produce some of the finest and most unique ceramics that I've ever seen, and I wanted to relate my experience. First, I must point out that much of the pottery sold in Jerusalem, particularly the Old City, is made to resemble Armenian pottery. I was surprised to find hundreds of shops in Jerusalem that sell imitation items, known as Hebron pottery, which is often factory made. Unless the shop is owned and operated by Armenians, it is unlikely to be Armenian pottery. 'The Armenian pottery of Jerusalem differs from ceramics made in the Republic of Armenia, in that the former is executed in bright under glaze colors of cobalt blue, turquoise, yellow, green, black and red on a white background generally. It is contrasted with the ceramics of Armenia that tend to be on rough brown earthenware, but also with lively colors painted on top. It's also important to know that the Armenian pottery of Jerusalem can remind the untrained eye of Turkish pottery because it originated with potters who fled the Ottoman Empire at the time of the genocide. These potters lived in the town of Kutahya where Turkish and Armenian influences often converged. However, to my knowledge, there are no longer any Armenian potters in Turkey. I did not see any Turkish pottery for sale in Jerusalem, and it is unlikely that a shopkeeper would try to pass off Turkish pottery as Armenian because both are high priced and equally prized. The father of Armenian pottery in Jerusalem was David Ohannessian, who arrived in Jerusalem in 1919. By 1922, two craftsmen who had come with Ohannessian from Kutahya - the potter, N. Balian, and the painter, M. Karakashian - left Ohannessian's workshop and established their won shop on Nablus Road. The partnership between N. Balian and M. Karakashian lasted 40 years, but with their passing in the 1960's their sons established two separate workshops, still in operation today: the Karakashian Brothers, 15 Via Delorosa in the Old City, and Balian Armenian Ceramics, 14 Nablus Road, located opposite the American Consulate. First, I visited Balian Ceramics where Neshan Balian, grandson of the founder, offered to open his workshop for me on a day when they are normally closed. The Balian workshop is the largest in Jerusalem. It has a central courtyard that bedazzles with murals of palm and Cyprus trees flowing with flowers, birds and exotic animals created by Neshan's mother, Marie Balian. Off the main courtyard on one side is the sales shop with hundreds of ceramic vases, plates and tiles. On the other side are the kilns, the clay formations and the stations for various painters. Every type of Armenian pottery is available at the Balians. The tile murals inspired by Marie are the most unique, but I also purchased a plate with the picture of a Persian musician, and another with Mount Ararat in the background. Nishan made me three beautifully decorated cups with the names of each of my three children. Second, I visited the Karakashian Brothers workshop. Getting there was part of the fun because they are located not in the Armenian quarter, but near the central market place of the Old City, which is culturally Arab, both Muslim and Christian. I had to wind through the narrow streets and inquire about its location on the Via Dolorosa. For Christians, this is the path of Jesus and many of the Stations of the Cross. Hagop Karakashian, grandson of the workshop's founder, finally greeted me at the entrance of a small facade that led to a bigger sales shop, and ultimately to an upstairs open-air courtyard and work area. A sense of history overwhelms the Karakashian store. The styles are the traditional Armenian flowers, birds and animals. Larger pieces are harder to find, but the quality is unmistakable. M. Karakashian, the founder, was the painter of the original group from Kutahya, and the painting of his descendants' work still excels. I purchased a yellow vase with deer prancing and a blue plate with two peacocks entwined. There is nothing that compares to the various shades of blue in the Armenian ceramics of Jerusalem. The next three shops I wanted to visit are actually in the Armenian Quarter of the Old City. They are easy to find along both sides of the Armenian Patriarchate Road, and should be visited along with the historic sites of the Armenian Quarter. The potters often copy the designs from the churches and historic sites of Jerusalem, particularly Saint James Cathedral, the seat of the patriarchate. You must visit St. James Cathedral, including Etchmiadzin Chapel as well as the Armenian Museum. The chapel has ceramic tiles with religious scenes, copies of which exist in several of the shops. Hanging from the ceiling of the Cathedral's main sanctuary are the colorful ceramic eggs with motifs of angels, crosses and flowers. They were made in Katahya by Armenian potters and were brought to Jerusalem by pilgrims. The Armenian Museum has beautiful ceramic vases also brought from Katahya by Armenian benefactors of the patriarchate. They have Armenian writing on the surface, which is rarely the case with modern ceramics made by Jerusalem potters. In order to reach the three shops in the Armenian Quarter, it is best to enter the Old City by the Jaffa Gate and immediately turn right, pass the Tower of David to the Armenian Patriarchate Road. The first shop on your left is Vic's Armenian Art Studio. Vic Lepejian, the store's owner, was in California at the time of my visit, but his son gladly helped me. From what I could surmise, Vic is as much a painter as a potter, and there were many of his watercolors for sale along with ceramics. I actually purchased a large watercolor of the Armenian Quarter with the view I could see from the King David Hotel where I was staying. Vic's ceramics were unlike the others, in that he creates scenes of Armenia, as well as Jerusalem. I purchased a two-tile set with an unidentified Armenian church set against the background of Mount Ararat. It had Armenian writing with a religious message across the bottom. When you leave Vic's, proceed further down the Patriarchate Road and to the right just before the entrance to Saint James Cathedral you'll find Sandrouni Armenian Art Center. Garo Sandrouni, one of three brothers who are potters, greeted me on a Sunday. His is the only one of the six shops to my knowledge that is open on a Sunday. Garo Sandrouni has a brother who moved to Toronto, Canada a few years ago and makes Jerusalem pottery there that I have purchased by mail. His third brother still works with him in Jerusalem. Garo is also a painter whose oils and watercolors are for sale in the shop, but most of his works are ceramic. My favorites were the tiles, which he copied from the Etchmiadzin Chapel. Sandrouni Armenian Art Center also sells ceramic eggs like the ones hanging in St. James Cathedral, and I purchased two different ones. Garo is particularly proud of his vases and tiles with Persian hunting scenes. They are beautiful, but I stuck to the Armenian items with my purchases. Next, you will want to continue down Patriarchate Road past St. James Cathedral until you come to the Zion Gate on your right. Just past the Zion Gate on the left is Hagop Antreassian's Studio for Pottery and Ceramics. It is easy to miss because there are larger stores on either side, displaying the imitation Hebron pottery so make sure you go to Hagop's. Hagop was also in the U.S. at the time of my visit, but his daughter showed me the shop and the particularly styles for which he is known. Hagop prefers flowers and birds, the traditional Armenian ceramic art. There were no scenes of the city on his pottery and many items had just geometric designs. He also had wooden boxes with ceramic tiles on top, and several items with inverse colors so the background was blue and the decoration stood out in white against the blue background. I purchased two large vases in this style as well as a small wooden box. I also purchased some geometric plates. After leaving Hagop's shop, I made my way back to the Jaffa Gate and left the Old City to return to the King David Hotel, about a 15-minute walk. I fully intended to end my shopping for Jerusalem pottery because I was unaware of any other shops. However, as I approached the shopping arcade next to the hotel, I noticed a ceramic tile mural on the wall of the arcade at the corner of the street. It was signed Arman Darian. I walked into the store behind the wall and asked the Israeli shopkeeper if he knew how to contact the potter. He directed me to Arman's shop about three blocks away from the hotel on Shlomzion Hamalka Street. Arman's store could not have been missed because the ceramics were displayed on the sidewalk outside. Arman Darian is of interest personally because he is from Armenia. He was educated as a painter there, and did not switch to ceramics until he came to Jerusalem after finishing school about 20 years ago. As I've mentioned, most Armenian potters in Jerusalem are natives of Israel of Israel, and some go back generations. Arman was pleased to know that I had been to Armenia many times, and we discussed various sites that visited in Yerevan and elsewhere. Few people who have been to Armenia apparently visit his shop. Arman's ceramics were unique in that he combined traditional Jerusalem styles with his own creative ideas and rarely was there an item that appeared repetitive of another. I particularly liked a vase that was cut out on top in a filigree style, which I purchased. I also bought two cups that were shaped like challises, and matching candlesticks. Lastly, I bought plates with wonderful vivid designs and multicolor tiles with scenes of Jerusalem. Arman is really an interior designer who will decorate all or part of your house with Armenian ceramics. His work is becoming part of the public landscape in the center of Jerusalem. When I returned home to the U.S. with my Jerusalem pottery, I was surprised to find how much nicer it looked in the house than in the shops in Jerusalem. I believe this is because there are so many items in the shops that they get a chance to display the individual pieces at home they really shine!

"Imagine it is the present day in an alternate universe. A historically progressive American paper publishes a front-page article declaring that the Jews of Europe were killed in world War II because they were agents of a foreign power that did not yet exist. A prestigious literary journal sneeringly dismisses the Holocaust as have been the massacre of a few thousand Jews who had rioted against their Christian fellow citizens of Germany. Now let us imagine that the same Nazi Germany had been fought not to defeat, but to a draw. The modern state acknowledges that regrettable atrocities were committed on both sides during the Second World War, but venerates the architects of the Final Solution as national heroes. Tourists can visit the ruins of synagogues and the cultural relics of Eastern European Jews who lived in the region, even as the government destroys the few remaining monuments - the more artistic of which are attributed in guidebooks to the ancestors of the Germans themselves. One U.S. presidential candidate after another promises to sign a Congressional bill acknowledging that what happened to the Jews was genocide but nobody ever does, for good relations with Germany come at the price of a courteous silence. There is an Israel, but it is isolated by a Nazi blockade, a third of its population dead of disease and starvation or in emigration in search of work. The Jews themselves have tried in vain to advance recognition of their cause. A very few have resorted to terrorism. Some write books, and the most recent is about how the catastrophe, when it actually did happen, managed to rouse the conscience of the nest and the brightest across America, only for everything - historical record meetings, missions, resolutions, headlines, eyewitness reports and published archives - to be consigned to oblivion soon thereafter. Substitution of Armenians for Jews in the paragraph above returns us to this universe. It was a front-page article in the Forward in 1995 that claimed that Armenians, about 1.5 million of whom were exterminated by the Ottoman Turkish state in 1915, were assisting the Soviet effort to overtake Turkey - even though it was not until 1920 that the Russian Armenian province, the guberniya of Erevan, was conquered by the Bolsheviks, and two years more until a state called the Soviet Union came into being. The majority of the Armenians who were killed were farmers and craftsmen who knew no foreign language, lived in villages a fortnight from the nearest port or railhead, and rarely traveled even half as far. The second article, by Christopher de Bellaigue, which reduced the whole business to a few thousand Armenians killed while rioting against their Muslim fellow citizens, was published in the New York Review of Books. The latter is not only an untruth, it is the opposite of the truth. There were two waves of the extermination of the Armenians in Ottoman Turkey, and de Bellaigue's remark seems to refer to the first: In 1895-96, members of the Armenian community of the capital, Constantinople, demonstrated peacefully against the systematic murder and extortion of their compatriots in the Anatolian interior (historical Armenia) by government tax-collectors and Kurdish marauders in the pay of the Ottoman authorities. The protest was suppressed with extreme violence; it was followed by a wave of state-sponsored massacres, called a jihad and led by Muslim mullahs and softas (theological students), in which some 200,000 Armenians were slaughtered. I replied to these lies and defamations in letters to the editors of both periodicals. Neither was published without phone calls, more letters and reminders stretching out over months, in the case of the Review, which cut my original letter down to 700 words - half its original length. And this in a publication that this year devoted thousands of words in its Letters section to arguments about the placement of an umlaut in a German name. Today's Armenia, a tiny state in the Transcaucasus, exists only because it was part of Tsarist Russia and then the Soviet Union. In Soviet times, it flourished: The country was cherished and supported by the Diaspora much as Israel was to be by Jews; there was even a kind of law of return, of which many thousands took advantage. The region today is now independent, and has been under Turkish blockade for over a decade. As a result of severe conditions, many of my colleagues there [Turkey] have died young. The Ottoman leaders who planned and carried out the Armenian genocide are officially celebrated as heroes of the present successor state, which simultaneously denies that the genocide took place. Throughout eastern Anatolia, the names of Armenian towns have been changed and priceless monuments of medieval Armenian Christian art had been systematically destroyed by 1997. The official Turkish line is that the Armenians are not there now because they never were; and if there were any, well, then it was they who did the massacring - of their Turkish neighbors. But the Armenians were also dangerous foreign elements, a fifth column, so the genocide was justified. Though it didn't happen. So all the testimony of the survivors, those unlettered, gentle grandmothers who never served a foreign state, who never struck a fellow creature in anger, but who worked and cooked and raised children and forged a new life in the factory towns and working-class neighborhoods of New England, is all a carefully corroborated fraud, a conspiracy. The vast majority of Armenians seek recognition of the genocide through writing and political action (to such an extent that some Armenologists have come to believe that the domination of this single issue has frozen out other aspects of Armenian life and culture). One such writer is Peter Balakian, a poet and professor of English at Colgate University, who, in a memoir titled Black Dog of Fate (Basic Book, 1997), chronicled how he gradually became aware of his family's tragic past even as he was growing up in an affluent Tenafly, NJ home, visiting scholarly aunts on Riverside Drive, going to college, being a jock, getting laid. At the end of the book, Balakian presents a dreamlike poem in which the hike for fixings for the night's dolma with Grandma becomes a kind of death march down the New Jersey Turnpike, with contemporary Newark in flames in the distance: Armenia in 1915 transferred to America. There is a coda to match this nightmare of repetition: It is the waking catharsis of transformation, of Balakian's first participation in a demonstration on Times Square to commemorate and anniversary of the beginning of the genocidal campaign of 1915. The writer, in finding a past that his family's sense of grief and shame had muted, had recovered a pat of his own voice, thereby enlarging and sharpening his engagement with the world as he emerges as an activist. So it may have been inevitable that, from this newly enraged conscience on fire, The Burning Tigris would flow. It is a mighty work, a slow burn of muted eloquence, dense with scholarship. Balakian's training in English literature and American studies has served him especially well, since a large part of the book is dedicated to the stupendous and nearly universal outpouring of sympathy for the Armenians and condemnation of Ottoman barbarity throughout the nightmare years among American and British writers, intellectuals, clergymen and politicians. Armenia was a pivotal moral issue in American society, and Balakian makes a compelling argument that the expressed sense of responsibility for a distant, oppressed nation marked the beginning of the modern human rights movement. It was not seen, even at the time, in isolation, not was advocacy on behalf of the Armenians an expression of Christian chauvinism: The fate of the Armenians was likened repeatedly to that of the Jew enduring the Tsar's pogroms. The ancient Armenian language, with its rich literature dating back to pagan and early Christian times, enjoyed great respect and an intense academic interest nearly inconceivable today: Alice Stone Blackwell's anthology of translations, Armenian Poems (reprinted by Caravan Books, 1978), the vision of a culture in crisis, was but one of many popular books on Armenia. During World War I, eyewitness reports of the arrests, death marches and mass killings poured in from American diplomats and missionaries, journalists and physicians. When the war ended, President Wilson declared, Armenia is to be redeemed. But, as Balakian points out, no amount of agitation or mass of fact could ever materially affect American policy. The While House did not condemn the Ottomans in 1896. The United States did not go to war against Turkey in 1971. After the October Revolution, Russia withdrew from the war and Turnkey invaded the Transcaucasus, continuing to massacre the Armenians even after its own capitulation. The surviving sliver of Armenia controlled by Russia was incorporated into the Soviet Union, and President Wilson's postwar plan for an American mandate in Armenia was eventually voted down by an isolationist Senate. Despite continuing public pressure on behalf of the Armenians, American policy in the 1920s was more concerned with achieving a foothold in the Muslim Middle East, and access to oil, than in a nation of which a third were refugees, another third under Soviet rule and the rest extinct. Balakian's book rehashes the voluminous testimony to the dangerously disenfranchised condition of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in the mid- and late-19th century and to the planning, execution and aftermath of the Armenian genocide at the close of that century and in World War I. Much of this material is already well known from various published memoirs, and from the monographs of eminent historians specializing in the period, such as Processors Vahakn Dadrian of SUNY Geneseo and Richard Hovannisian of University of California Los Angeles. Balakian's true accomplishment with this book is his demonstration of how visible, vigorous and universal was consciousness of, and support for, the Armenians - so much so that the book often reads like a Who's Who of New England and New York. This raises in my mind a question that I think historians of Armenia have hitherto failed to pose. The late Edward Said's influential polemic, Orientalism, presented a picture of the Near East without Ottoman official Islam, imperial power or Armenian massacres - an unreal world in which statements and concerns of scholars of the region would indeed appear biased or imperialistic. Armenian history gives the lie to Said's constructions. In the 19th century, there was no Arab state that played any significant political role in world affairs. The only Muslim state on the world stage was Ottoman Turkey, whose sultan also was the titular head of Sunni Islam and the guardian and ruler of Mecca and Medina (and Jerusalem, too). Turkey was a powerful empire whose borders were close to the heart of Europe. It ruled millions of Christian subjects, all of whom were second-class citizens at best. At worst, they were the victims of frequent extortion and pogroms. Any serious European or American student of Near Eastern affairs could not fail to take note of Turkey's strength as an adversary and of the oppressive and retrograde character of its official religion, Islam. It was natural, moreover, that such students dedicate their expertise, while exercising appropriate professional standards, to the service of their countries' interests. The case of the Armenians, so egregious and so universally known, throws into the sharpest relief this state of affairs. Mountains covered with forests and orchards, their higher slopes often wreathed in fog, loom above the plain of Issos, where Alexander the Great inflicted a stunning defeat on Darius, above the waters of the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean. One of these is Musa Dagh, the Mountain of Moses. In 1915, the besieged people of five Armenian villages there fought the Turkish soldiers sent to exterminate them, and held them off until a French warship rescued the survivors. They returned after the war and placed a small stone plaque depicting a ship on the summit of Musa Dagh. Some of the Armenian citrus farmers are still there. I visited their new church, in the village of Vakifli. One old man led me out of town and showed me where the fighting had taken place, but the plaque was gone: The Turkish authorities destroyed it long ago. The German Jewish writer Franz Werfel published his novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh in 1933 and, two years later, Hitler acceded to Turkey's request that the book be banned; the same year, the U.S. State Department, under Turkish pressure, forced MGM to drop its plans to make a movie of the book. Since then, the U.S. government has steadfastly refused to term what happened to the Armenians a genocide. This year, an Armenian nurse at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem who specializes in the rehabilitation of survivors of Palestinian suicide bombings was to receive an award on Israel Independence Day: Under Turkish pressure, the government removed from the program booklet the lines mentioning that her grandparents had been survivors of the Armenian genocide. It is well known, of course, that Ottoman Turkey afforded a welcome, by the standards of the age, to the Sephardic Jews fleeing the Inquisition, and in recent years the Turkish Republic has been a crucial friend and military ally of Israel in a very tough neighborhood indeed. But the insistence of the government in Ankara that America and Israel deny the Armenian genocide as the price of continued friendship is too high to pay and in the end probably need not be paid for the alliance to continue. It is, besides, misguided. Denial warps Turkish society itself, as the Turkish scholar Taner Akcam has pointed out: Falsification of history leads to other kinds of repression. Toward the end of his book, Balakian notes that in 1997 France recognized the Armenian genocide as such. Turkey protested loudly, but soon life went back to normal. The United States, he suggests, is too fearful, and he closes on a generous and optimistic note, citing the brave verses about the Armenian tragedy by the great Turkish poet, Nazim Hikmet. Unfortunately, I fear Balakian's optimism is misplaced. His petitions and warm appeals to human solidarity have their place, but they are not the lesson of The Burning Tigris. Since the Tigris burned and the Euphrates ran red, genocide has become a permanent aspect of human affairs. The Armenians, a visible and striving minority with economic and intellectual strength but no military or political power, dehumanized as infidels over a millennium of Muslim oppression and misrule, survived in the end only because the Russian army's nuclear umbrella sheltered (and shelters) Erevan. The Armenians of Karabagh averted a new massacre in the early 1990s because they got arms and learned how to use them. As a Zionist leader told an assembly full of yeshiva kids in Lithuania on the eve of the Holocaust: Children! I want you to learn. I want you to learn to shoot.

"I usually conduct my own research when writing my column. However, a few weeks ago, I was sent an article written by Jim Lobe, called Neo-conservatism, hardcore. It arrived by email two days before Pres. Bush's State of the Union address. Coupling it with what the president had to say, I became frightened as to the possible direction the neo-conservatives (neocons) might succeed in pulling this great country. The neocons continue to insist that anyone in opposition to their entire program must be sympathetic to Saddam Hussein. This accusation or contention is so ridiculous that, if it were not a major line in the neocon bible, it would qualify as a terrible joke. The ironic part about it is that most of the ideologues in the neocon camp who have no qualms about unleashing war and fighting against other countries have not so much as dared to wear a uniform. The closest that Richard Perle has come to combat as a serviceman is sitting at a desk in the Pentagon. Now David Frum (former Bush speechwriter), who has been credited with coining the phrase the axis of evil that was included in Pres. Bush's earlier justification for pre-emptive strikes, joins Mr. Perle in advocating an all-out war against all countries with whom the US has serious differences. They spell out their plan for waging war in their book, An End to Evil: How to Win the War On Terror. CONJURING UP THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM These two ideologues think they must remind Americans that terrorism is a scourge that sucks many innocent people into its vortex; they believe that Americans are losing their ardor for the fight. So they conjure up images of Adolph Hitler with the comment that it must be total victory or holocaust. It is no accident that these two men use the word holocaust. They know that the word has become the metaphor for the Nazi Final Solution for the Jews, one of the major horrors of the last century. I don't know of anyone who does not agree that Saddam was one of the most despicable leaders to ever gain the seat of power in a country. He ranks with the 20th-century murderers Talaat, Hitler and his crew, Stalin, Lenin, Pol Pot, and the Rwandan orchestrators of genocide. There is no question that Saddam Hussein had to be brought to justice. The issue is the means that were employed and their consequences. The two neocons do not advance the idea that there are only some Muslims who are radical and want the destruction of the US and any nation that opposes their perversions. They argue that the roots of Muslim rage are to be found in Islam itself. Logically extended, their arguments that Saddam had to be eliminated, and that Osama bin Laden should follow, points to the Islamic faith. Carrying the Perle and Frum logic a step further, if the roots of evil are in Islam, the religion itself can breed others similar to Saddam Hussein and bin Laden; hence, the US and the West should declare war on the religion itself. These two characters all but declared a Christian-Jewish jihad against Islam. They are apparently true believers of the war of civilizations. The Jews and Christians who I know shudder at this perverted thinking, and I honestly doubt that these radicals (Perle and Frum) will find too many advocates, even among their fellow neocons. THE ULTRA-EXTREME CAMP I have criticized VP Cheney, SECDEF Rumsfeld, Deputies Wolfowitz, Feith and some others. However, while I disagree with many of their policies, I have not read or heard anything that puts them in the same ultra-extreme camp as Perle and Frum. These two ultra-extremists pose and immediate danger to US values, even if one agrees that Iraq posed a near term danger to the US. They see no friends outside of the US borders except Israel and perhaps Great Britain. Even internally, they insist that certain members of Congress, such as CIA Director George Tenet, numerous high-ranking retired military officers (among them would be Wesley Clark and Gen. Zinni), some members of George Bush the elder's cabinet, and officials in the State Department who questioned the veracity of going to war against Iraq need to be set aside. How dare anyone argue against their demands to expand the war against Syria, Iran, North Korea and, if necessary, against Saudi Arabia? Mr. Frum is apparently a Johnny-come-lately to the public. He made his mark in Washington as a speechwriter, not as a foreign policy expert. But Richard Perle did not gain the sobriquet as the Prince of Darkness on a whim. He earned the title. From his seat in the Pentagon during the Reagan administration, not too far from my office when I wore a uniform, he opposed arms-control agreements with the Soviet Union. He is close to Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith, and hopefully those two gentlemen have the sense to recognize the dangers to the US public that Mr. Perle espouses. Some of the ideas advocated by the two (Frum and Perle) are truly incomprehensible and border on the insane. Unless Saudi Arabia provides utmost cooperation in the war on terror, they want the US to actively promote the secession of the lands on which Saudi oil is found. WHAT'S THE FORMULA FOR COOPERATION? Presumably, the two radical thinkers have a formula of what comprises cooperation. Forget about Syria's borders. The US should pursue suspected terrorists across the borders unless Syria's policies and economics metamorphose to Western orientation. Since these two neocons are in opposition to France and Germany, Western really means US. Forget trying to talk North Korea into scratching its nuke program and allowing inspectors into the country. Instead, the US should prepare preemptive strikes against the nuclear plants, even though the US does not know where all of the nuclear plants are. Forget the UN, unless it charter is amended to accept Washington's pre-emptive strike concept. Do not pay attention to the grass-roots initiatives in Iran to make changes and ignore the moderates in government. Erect a bigger barrier on Iran and support the overthrow of the current regime. The madness of these two men goes on. Implicit in all of this is constant erosion of civil liberties in the US, on which the foundations of this great democracy were established. I have great faith in the American system of checks and balances. There has been some damage, but I keep in mind that Joe McCarthy had a few days in the spotlight and then he self-destructed. We have too many people in Congress (Democrat as well as Republican) who, in the bi-partisan spirit, will continue as a check to the radical fringe.

"In the UK, 27th of January is officially recognised as Britain's Annual Holocaust Memorial Day. Jews, Armenians and other peoples that have been subjected to crimes against humanity organise various initiatives to create awareness and address their plight on and around the above-mentioned date. Sunday, the 25th, I attended one such initiative called Desecration, organised by the Gomidas Institute (UK) in association with Naregatsi Art Institute of New York. The event was held at Hayashen in Acton, London. Mr. Ara Sarafian, the director of Gomidas Institute and an academic, welcomed all the attendees who seemed to be a mixed crowd of Armenians and non-Armenians. Then he introduced Mr. Nareg Hartounian of Naregatsi Art Institute, who, in turn, asked Mr. Hrair Khatcherian to talk about Desecration as a project and narrate along with the film. Mr. Khatcherian talked about how this project was first initiated and the pains and perils endured to bring it to completion. Desecration was a documentary film and a photo exhibit that symbolises the gallant spirit of the Armenians which Hrair Khatcherian, as a photojournalist, has naturally inherited. And this is clearly manifested in his art. The artists that are acquainted with Hrair seem to know him as the Hawk, and this has become his nickname within artistic circles of North America. This is due to his unique and personal approach towards art. For an example, take Desecration: it is all about attack and retaliation of an individual who is born into an oppressed community that has suffered extensively, a nation that has been made to believe that lamentation is all they have left. Through Desecration, Hrair the Hawk dares to explore the denialist policy of Ankara and the grave consequences of such a policy. His photography and filming demonstrates the current methods and tactics of a state ethnocide that seems to be systematically implemented against the Armenians and their heritage in Turkey. Where a vast number of hamlets and monasteries have been, they are now being reduced to rubble by destruction. Armenian tombstones have been destroyed and utilised by local Turks and Kurds as building materials. Many churches have been converted to mosques and equally a large number of monasteries, dating back to the early Christian era, have become storage houses for local peasants or where they milk their goats. Once watching the film, I came to believe that the predominant policy of Turkey towards Armenians and other national minorities seems to resonate with what the Nazi leader, Herman Goering, used to say, When I hear the word culture, I reach out to my revolver. And this is what Hrair is so defiant about. According to him, this policy must change, and a more civilised and brotherly attitude must be adopted, to create an environment for the coexistence of Armenians and Turks. As an Assyrian this event was a real experience to me. I came to understand that it is not just the Assyrian people and anything to do with the Assyrians that are given an appalling treatment. And that the oppression of the Assyrians is shared by all the national minorities in Turkey. Yes, it seems apparent to me that the genocide of the Greeks, Armenians and the Assyrians remains unrecognized and a taboo in Turkey. The Turkish policy makers want to eliminate or distort everything that is of non-Turkish and Muslim heritage. I met some wonderful people who were very welcoming and greeted me as one of their own. One such lady was Ms. Odette Basil who is involved with the British-Armenian All Party Parliamentary Group. This is a strong lobby group that has sixty-six parliamentary members striving to gain recognition of the Armenian Genocide in Great Britain. Towards the end of the event I had an opportunity to talk to this wonderful lady who was astonished to learn that we, Assyrians, do not have a similar group based in London.

"In our lifetime we have witnessed breathtaking changes in the fields of science, technology, medicine, space exploration, global economic integration and geopolitics. Based on the level of their economic, sociological and educational development, nations of the world are divided among three categories : 1) Developed, 2) In transition and 3) Underdeveloped. According to their economic, technological and military potential and might, nations of the world are classified as: A) Global Superpowers. B) Regional Powers. C) Dependent and Client States. In the early seventies and eighties there was another group called the Non-Aligned Movement, led by President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito, President of India Jawaharlal Nehru, and President of Indonesia Sukarno. This group included many Afro-Asian states, all of whom rejected the Cold War as an organizing principle for international relations and tried to establish political space between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. This entity is currently nonexistent. WORLD DOMINATION THE GOAL During our time we have witnessed grand alignments among the great powers either to dominate the world, to protect the world from domination, or to dictate fascist or communist ideology or spread democracy. The underlying motivation has been to control energy sources and energy transportation routes, to have access to new markets, the labor and capital of other nations, in order to control the world economy. Our generation and that of our fathers witnessed WWII and the rise of communism in Russia and fascism in Germany. We witnessed WWII and the collapse of fascism in Germany, Italy and Japan and the beginning of the protracted Cold War between Soviet expansionism and American imperialism. During the Cold War we lived through tense experiences, including the Berlin blockade, crush of freedom up-risings in East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Poland by Soviet forces, and the frightening Cuban missile crisis. We have seen the wars of containment in Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Afghanistan, to stop international communist aggression initiated by the Soviet Union and Red China. Now we are seeing the war and clash between civilizations, war between the civilized Judeo-Christian world and the angry Muslim fundamentalist world. Predisposing factors that have triggered this clash between Christian and Islamic world are: 1) The humiliation of the Arabs and Muslims in general by Jews, Christian Europeans, Russians and Americans, during the Palestinian conflict, Suez Canal crisis, Russian invasion of Afghanistan and Chechnya, U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq. 2) In order to distract their own population from their daily difficulties, the leaders of Saudi Arabia are exporting Wahabism by terrorist methods in the Caucasus, Central Asia and Middle East, to undermine Russian, British and American cultural and political influence and hegemony. 3) Great powers' determination to establish full control over the energy sources located in Islamic lands, causing resentment, and militant Muslims are reacting. HAVES VS. HAVE-NOTS There is also a clash between the worlds of the haves and the have-nots. On one side are the proponents of globalization led by multinational corporations, like Honeywell, IBM, Lockheed Martin, Telecom, Hewlett-Packard, Mobil-Exxon, Caterpillar, General Electric Xerox, General Motors, Whirlpool, Proctor and Gamble, AT&T, etc., which are forming a corporate coalition and advocating to eliminate national boundaries and to establish global free trade zones to sell their products in the world market unopposed. On the other side are the anti-globalization crusaders that are advocating the protection of national economy and national independence and are opposed to the idea of being open markets for industrialized nations and providers of cheap labor to multinational corporations. According to academics, economists and geo-strategists, with the end of the Cold War, contemporary politics has shifted toward integration and control of the global economy and energy resources. The broad term of globalization indicates economic, ecological and social interdependence among nations, as well as new concepts in co-production and capital investment. For this, a mechanism is established to de-territorialize open markets and utilize the cheap labor readily available in underdeveloped countries. Globalization is also a historical process of internationalization, westernization and modernization of the world economy. According to its proponents, it will bring economic prosperity to the underdeveloped countries by creating new jobs and improving the standard of living. According to its opponents, it is a neo-colonialism that is trying to eliminate the current national boundaries and nation-state structures by making the entire world an open market and the entire world population cheap laborers and consumers to the multinational corporations' products. The opponents of globalization claim that multinational corporations also control the world news media, the governments of industrialist nations and their military, and are in the position of reshaping interstate relations and political events, and determining whether to settle or create conflicts in different parts of the world. Although proponents of globalization are not neocolonialist and opponents are not neo-Marxist, there are merits in their arguments on both sides. Indeed, interrelations between industrialized and lesser developed or underdeveloped nations present a complex picture. Yet both sides need each other. U.S. UNDISPUTED GLOBAL POWER The U.S. is an undisputed global power with immense technological, economic, and military advantage over the rest of the nations of the world. Most of the multinational corporations that are instrumental in the development of highly sophisticated military and aerospace technologies, research and discoveries in medical science, chemistry, physics and genetics, are also specialized in how to excel in industrial and economic productivity and marketing, and they are headquartered on U.S. soil. The most advanced telecommunications and news media corporations, like Reuters, UPI, NBC, CBS, Fox News, TBS and AOL Time Warner, RFE/RL, VOA, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Time and Newsweek magazines are all headquartered in the U.S.; with branches all over the world, they are in a position to reshape world public opinion through an extensive network of television and satellite telecommunication broadcasting systems. Media and big business usually are interconnected and the corporations and media moguls are the primary beneficiaries as well as the bankrollers of the political system on the international level. The U.S. supremacy is challenged only by a group or groups of nations among the European Union countries, resurgent Russia and China. EU countries are fragmented into three separate factions. The first group is led by France and Germany, challenging U.S. leadership. The second group, led by UK, Spain and Italy, supports Washington without reservation. The third group, led by newcomers like Poland and the Baltic states, is in a state of realignment. RESURGENT RUSSIA Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, is trying to regain some of its lost superpower status. Moscow is facing Islamic militant threats along its soft southern belly, home of 60 million Muslims, and is content that the U.S. is trying to eradicate the Islamic fundamentalist threat and attempting to bring democracy to the Middle Eastern and Central Asian countries that are ruled by despots who are tolerating Islamic militants and terrorists to distract their discontented citizens' attention from internal difficulties. On the other hand, Russia is wary that the U.S., with its new assertive and aggressive policy, is penetrating into the traditional Moscow's sphere of influence. The Russians are also frustrated over being unable to control evolving political events in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia. China is another emerging power, which has the potential to challenge the U.S. in the near future. China, like Russia, is facing an Islamic threat and separatism within its borders so it is also happy to see the nests of the Islamic fundamentalists and militants crushed by the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. Yet China is also wary of the U.S. military might and their will to use it, and is looking for a close working relationship with the European Union, Russia, Far Eastern countries and Japan. CONCERNED U.S. ALLIES The U.S.'s power and might is also causing some concern in those countries that are traditionally considered to be close U.S. allies. One of them is Turkey. Unable to influence post-war political events in Iraq, Ankara is helplessly watching the formation of an autonomous Kurdish state along its southern border. Turks are blaming Americans for not taking their national interests into consideration. In order to counterbalance Kurdish ascendancy to power in Iraq, Turkey is forming a close working relationship with Syria and Iran, which are considered by Washington to be part of the Axis of Evil. In the same context, France and Germany are distancing themselves from the U.S., in turn, to get even. Washington is intending to withdraw military bases from Germany and establish new small mobile bases in Rumania, Bulgaria, Georgia and possibly in Azerbaijan. While these important political events are creating new alliances and reshaping the political orientation of the countries in the Eurasian continent, Middle East and Far East, our attention is focused on the future of Armenia. Although Armenia's importance to both Russia and America is considered to be marginal, both powers continue to have a close working relationship with Yerevan. While the U.S. is building a very sophisticated embassy building in Armenia, Russia continues to maintain a large embassy in Yerevan. Russian leaders praise Russian-Armenian strategic relationships, and the U.S. continues to provide economic and financial aid to both Armenia and Karabagh. In the middle of shifting loyalties in the Caucasus, where Georgia, after the Washington-inspired coup, has firmly become a U.S. ally. In Azerbaijan, Azeri leaders are continuously asking Washington to establish military bases in their country. NEED FOR MORE POLITICAL ACTIVISM Armenia feels the heat and urgency to face these new realities in the region. Armenia is counting on the Diaspora factor, which has the potential to influence political decision making in Washington through their elected congressmen and senators. Armenian lobbyist organizations, in particular the Armenian Assembly of America, have a crucial role to play in Washington. We heard over and over again that if Armenian lobbyists hadn't lobbied in Washington, Armenia and Karabagh wouldn't have received any financial and economic aid (which has so far totaled 1.2 billion dollars) during the past ten years. Equally America wouldn't have had a relatively evenhanded policy in the Karabagh dispute. Taking into consideration these new world realities, new geopolitical developments and geo-strategic imperatives, the Armenian Diaspora, now more than ever, needs to rally behind Armenian lobbyist organizations and directly participate in advocacy efforts in Washington, like the one sponsored by the Armenian Assembly of America in the nation's capital on April 18-20, 2004, and raise money for the elections of congressmen, senators, governors and mayors, through election fund drives. The corporate would coalition is playing a crucial role in today's global and regional economic and political decision-making process. According to sources, recent events in the Caucasus are part of these global games.

"The year 2003 also saw much activity within the Ukrainian religious realm. The appointment of new eparchs, a synod, the deaths of several prominent religious figures and attempts at the unification of divided Churches were among some of the more notable developments The Weekly reported. On February 3-6 the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UGCC) held a meeting of the Permanent Synod of Bishops. The UGCC hierarchs gathered in Rome to discuss the problems of the beatification of Ukrainian confessors of the faith, as well as the religious situation in Ukraine. On the morning of February 3, Pope John Paul welcomed members of the Permanent Synod of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, in particular their major archbishop, Cardinal Lubomyr Husar, and told them that their meeting in Rome is a happy occasion to reaffirm your communion with the Successor of Peter. On February 5, Cardinal Husar, and members of the Synod met with Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins, prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, and Archbishop Edward Nowak, secretary of the congregation. Special attention during their meeting was focused on the beatification of Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, which has entered its final stage. In addition, the Ukrainian hierarchs presented a list of new martyrs of the UGCC whose beatification processes would start shortly. All necessary documents for the beatification of Cardinal and Patriarch Josyf Slipyj were also submitted to the congregation's officers. Following the synod, Cardinal Husar made a pastoral visit to Canada on the invitation of Archbishop Michael Bzdel, metropolitan of Canada, and Bishop Cornelius Pasichny, eparch of Eastern Canada, on February 6-24. The 19-day trip included the cities of Winnipeg, Ottawa, Hamilton, Toronto and Montreal. In metro Toronto, an area with myriad Ukrainian institutions and many churches, Cardinal Husar's trip included parish visits and celebrations at the churches of St. Nicholas, St. Demetrius and the Holy Dormition Church. The Toronto visit included a grand banquet in Mississauga, attended by about 1,200 people, where the Church leader was welcomed by the mayor. Cardinal Husar left Toronto on February 24 for Great Britain, where two days later he marked his 70th birthday. During his trip to Canada Cardinal Husar also described the changes in the life of his Church. The cardinal said that the realization of a self-sufficient, partriarchal Church is no longer hampered by past problems. Today, the Church is ready to move toward the realization of a patriarchal Church because, we have all the necessary elements: our own homeland - the Ukrainian state - and our own ecclesiastic territory with more than 4.5 million faithful, Cardinal Husar said during an interview at the Holy Spirit Ukrainian Catholic Seminary in Ottawa. What is more, the said territory is now covered with a network of our [Ukrainian Catholic] structures, that is, eparchies, monasteries, seminaries, parishes. In short, we have all the elements in place that the Eastern canon law and ecclesiastic tradition require. We also have 1.5 million faithful engaged in the living, well-organized Church outside Ukraine. So, in terms of structure, there are no problems in creating a partriarchate, he said. The cardinal then went on to speak about ecumenism. Although, there are no formal ecumenical relations between the UGCC and the Orthodox Churches in Ukraine, personal relations between hierarchs of these Churches are friendly. However, he also observed that the beautiful stories from the Soviet past about Christians of different denominations helping each other, now that freedom is guaranteed, are being obliterated in some sectors of society by the return of prejudice. He talked, with considerable enthusiasm, about the ecumenical role of the UGCC within the sphere of the 21 Eastern Catholic Churches, on one hand, and within the global Catholic Church, on the other. As Cardinal Husar explained, within the global Catholic Church, the UGCC's role is unique. Since Ukraine is geographically placed between two worlds, two great cultures, it is our task to explain the East to the West, and the West to the East, that is, to bridge these two worlds by explaining Byzantine culture to the Latin culture and vice versa. The Weekly also reported that in response to the challenges and needs of Ukrainian Catholics and Ukrainian Orthodox in the 21st Century, the hierarchs of the Ukrainian Orthodox and Ukrainian Catholic Churches in North America - metropolitans, archbishops and bishops - were hosted by Metropolitan Constantine and Archbishops Antony and Vsevolod at a Fraternal Encounter on July 11 at St. Andrew the First-called Apostle Ukrainian Orthodox Center in South Bound Brook, N.J. The hierarchs had for some time been discussing the possibility and necessity of such a meeting as a means by which they could come to know one another on more than simply a social level. Such an encounter with open discussion of ecclesiastical and community issues was meant to be beneficial for the faithful in the long term. Participating in the one-day session were: Metropolitan Constantine, Central Eparchy, the prime hierarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A.; Metropolitan Stefan Soroka, Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia; Archbishop Jurij, Eastern Eparchy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church in Canada; Archbishop Antony, Eastern Eparchy, UOC; Bishop Basil Losten, Stamford Eparchy, UCC; Archbishop Vsevolod, Western Eparchy, UOC; Bishop Robert Moskal, St. Josaphat Eparchy, Parma, Ohio, UOC; Bishop Severian Yakymyshyn, Eparchy of New Westminster, British Columbia, Yukon and Northwest Territories, Canada, UCC; Cornelius Pasichny, bishop emeritus of Toronto and Eastern Canada, UCC; and Bishop Robert Seminak, St. Nicholas Eparchy Chicago, UCC. Reflected upon at great length at this first fraternal encounter of the Catholic and Orthodox hierarchs were issues common to both Ukrainian Orthodox and Catholics, whose parish communities and eparchies took root, grew and developed in North America as far back as the late 1800s. Addressed in broad terms were relationships with Ukrainian communities and organizations in North America and Ukraine; the challenges presented by the ongoing process of secularization in society; and the Church's role as the principal teacher and repository of faith and morality, and as the promoter and guardian of the sanctity of life. There was a solid agreement that in spite of the fact that there do exist some theological and dogmatic issues that divide the two Churches, there is the real possibility that the relationship between the two Churches on all levels can improve. The hierarchs agreed that such fraternal encounters should continue and set the date for the next one in early 2004. The Metropolia Center of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. in South Bound Brook/Somerset, N.J., on June 8 held a commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the death of Patriarch Mstyslav, the longtime prime hierarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. and Diaspora. Several hundred people took part in the prayerful commemoration, which began with divine liturgy in St. Andrew Memorial Church. Metropolitan Constantine and Archbishops Antony and Vsevolod concelebrated the liturgy, assisted by clergy. In the patriarch's crypt in Holy Resurrection Mausoleum beneath St. Andrew Church the hierarchs, 35 clergy and the faithful gathered in the late afternoon to offer prayer for the repose of Patriarch Mstyslav's soul. Participating in these prayers were the patriarch's son, Yaroslav, with his wife, Sophia, from Edmonton; and daughter Tamara from Toronto, with her children and grandchildren. Archbishop Vsevolod spoke prior to the panakhyda (requiem service) remembering Patriarch Mstyslav as the eldest among all the patriarchs of the Orthodox world and a Church leader who linked the 19th and 20th centuries. The patriarch was the nephew of Symon Petliura and it was from this family line that he inherited his civic and political commitment, which, in conjunction with the spiritual commitment he inherited from his monastic relatives, made him the unique leader he was. Following the memorial service, over 200 people remained for a memorial dinner in the Ukrainian Cultural Center. Metropolitan Constantine spoke about Metropolitan Mstyslav, who worked closely with Metropolitan John, his predecessor as prime hierarch of the Church. The evening concluded with the screening of a videotape of the patriarch's first arrival in Ukraine to the capital of Kyiv, well after midnight, his reception by thousands of people at the airport and surrounding St. Sophia Cathedral in the city, and his first visit to St. Sophia Cathedral in 49 years. In a move towards unity, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate (UOC-KP) called upon the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church (UAOC) to overcome the crisis inside the Church and unite in a national Orthodox Church in Ukraine in a statement released on March 20. The press service of the UOC-KP released the statement, titled We Will Love in Deed and Truth, But not Through Words and Tongue. With deep sorrow did the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate learn that over the last several months the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church has suffered events that aggravated the division in the Ukrainian Orthodoxy. Metropolitan Mefodii [Kudriakov], spiritual head of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, and Archbishop Ihor [Isichenko of Kharkiv and Poltava], responsible for managing affairs of the Patriarchate of the UAOC, released documents that caused another split in the UAOC, the statement read. The agreement on concrete measures towards unification signed by the UOC-KP and the UAOC at the Constantinople Patriarchate, working meetings on this matter both in the Constantinople Patriarchate and in Ukraine, and the approval of concluding documents gave many Orthodox believers in Ukraine hope that the division between the two Orthodox jurisdictions with similar standpoints concerning patriotism and the autocephaly of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church would be overcome. Unfortunately, since that time little has been done towards unification. The Kyiv Patriarchate has repeatedly called to resume the process which had already been begun, but received no response. After the UAOC hierarchs with whom an agreement had been reached lost their unity, the current situation was aggravated even more. Therefore, the Kyiv Patriarchate of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church fulfills its obligation to encourage the hierarchs and faithful of the UAOC to unite in a national Ukrainian Orthodox Church. This unification corresponds to the message and the spirit of the documents which were signed by plenipotentiary representatives of the UAOC in the Constantinople Patriarchate in the presence of His Beatitude Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople. This unification will meet the demands of Ukrainian Orthodoxy and mean the fulfillment of the covenant of love given by Jesus Christ. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church held the 18th Session of the Synod of Bishops of the Kyiv and Halych Metropolitanate in Lviv on March 18-19. Among the participants were 12 Ukrainian hierarchs, the members of the synod, and Archbishop Ivan Martyniak, metropolitan of Przemysl (Peremyshl) and Warsaw, Poland. Participants of the session discussed various organizational problems of the metropolitanate's hierarchical bodies and the synod, as well as a number of pastoral issues. They also considered possible ways for proper commemoration of the Year of the Family, proclaimed by the head of the UGCC in early January 2003. They gave corresponding instructions concerning The Procedure of Preparation for Marriage and other Church documents and religious practices. In addition, all priests of the metropolitanate were advised to emphasize the importance of joint prayer in families. Observances of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet-imposed Famine-Genocide in Ukraine in 1932-1933, the publication of a pastoral letter on economic reforms in Ukraine, and commemorations of the 700th anniversary of the establishment of the Kyiv and Halych Metropolitanate and of the 750th anniversary of the coronation of King Danylo of Halych were also discussed during the session. The Weekly also reported that thousands of people were forming queues outside of St. Volodymyr Cathedral in Kyiv beginning on May 3 to get a glimpse of the Shroud of Turin, what is perceived to be the likeness of Jesus Christ found on a copy of an ancient cloth. The relic, a Vatican-sanctioned replica of the Shroud of Turin, arrived in Kyiv from Lviv during Holy Week according to the Gregorian calendar. Since September 2002, it had been on display at St. George Cathedral of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin. The copy, one of eight that exist in the world, bears the imprint of a human figure, which Christian believers say is the likeness of Jesus Christ. The original shroud, found in the Italian city of Turin and displayed very rarely, is said to be the cloth that the biblical figure Joseph of Aramithea gave for the burial of Jesus after He was crucified. The copy that toured Ukraine, which is considered the best replication of the original, is permanently found in Miensk, Belarus. Later in the year, the pope announced the appointment of Msgr. Richard Seminack, pastor of Holy Trinity Ukrainian Catholic Church in Carnegie, Pa., as the new eparch of the St. Nicholas Eparchy in Chicago. The appointment, made on May 25, affirmed the nomination made to the holy father by the Synod of Ukrainian Catholic Bishops. The bishop-elect succeeded Bishop Michael Wiwchar, CSsR, who was appointed in November 2000 as the bishop for the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy in Saskatoon. Bishop Wiwchar had served as administrator of the Chicago Eparchy from November 2000 until the appointment by the pope. Bishop Seminack, 61, studied at St. Basil's Seminar College in Stamford, Conn., at St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Seminary and The Catholic University of America in Washington, where he received a master's of divinity degree. The year 2003 also saw the ordination of the Rev. Stephen V. Chmilar, 58, as the Ukrainian Catholic Church's eparch of Toronto and Eastern Canada on July 23 at the Church of the Holy Dormition in Mississauga, Ontario. Cardinal Husar, recognized within the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (UCC) as its patriarch, traveled from his chancery in Lviv via Rome to lead the ceremony. Bishop-elect Chmilar succeeded Bishop Cornelius J. Pasichny OSBM, who retired earlier in the year at the age of 75, after heading the eparchy since 1998. Having received nominations from the Synod of Bishops of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II announced on May 3 that the Rev. Chmilar had been named as the next eparch of Toronto. A reception at the Mississauga Convention Center after the service was attended by over 800 clergy, faithful and well-wishers. Pope John Paul II also approved on July 28 the creation of the exarchate of southern Ukrainian Odesa and Crimea by dividing the territory of Kyiv and Vyshhorod exarchate. The pope also approved the appointment of Father Vasyl Ivasiuk of the Sokal eparchy as exarch of Odesa and Crimea that same day. On November 23, the pope sent Cardinal Husar and Roman Catholic Cardinal Marian Jaworski a statement on the commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the Famine Genocide of 1932-1933. Millions of people suffered a terrible death through the pernicious activities of an ideology that throughout the 20th century became the cause of suffering and grief in many parts of the world. On this occasion, I wish to participate spiritually in the memorial ceremonies that will be held in honor of the countless victims of the Great Famine that occurred in Ukraine during the reign of the Communist regime. I speak of the terrible plan carried out with cold calculation by those in power in that era, the pope's statement read. The experience of this tragedy should today guide the feelings and activities of the Ukrainian people on the road to concord and cooperation. The Weekly also reported that Bishop Isidore Borecky, the former Ukrainian Catholic eparch of Toronto and Eastern Canada, died on July 23, at Toronto's Western Hospital, after 65 years in the priesthood and 55 years as a bishop. An estimated 1,200 mourners paid their last respects on July 23-26 to a man hailed as a builder, a patron and an active supporter of the Ukrainian Catholic Patriarchate. Cardinal Lubomyr Husar was on hand to officiate at Bishop Borecky's funeral at Mississauga's Church of the Holy Dormition, and delivered the funeral oration. The newly ordained eparch of Toronto and Eastern Canada, Bishop Chmilar, read a message from the Vatican. A bishop's parastas was offered on July 24 at St. Nicholas Church, and on July 25 at the eparchy's cathedral, St. Josaphat's, both in Toronto. An estimated 650 clergy and laity participated. It was also reported in 2003 that a shrine dedicated to Nicholas Charnetsky was consecrated in Lviv. During the divine liturgy that Pope John Paul II celebrated in Lviv on June 27, 2001, 27 Ukrainian Catholics - referred to as Blessed Venerable Martyr Nicholas Charnetsky and his Companions were beatified as martyrs and confessors of the faith. On July 11, 2002, a memorial cross had been consecrated on one of the scenic hills in the city of Lviv, marking the future site of the Shrine of Blessed Venerable Martyr Nicholas Charnetsky. On July 4, 2002, the relics of the martyr Nicholas Charnetsky were solemnly transferred from the Lychakiv Cemetery to the Church of St. Josaphat, which is under the pastoral care of the Redemptorist Fathers of the Lviv Province. A procession of many thousands of faithful passed through the streets of the ancient royal city. During the first week that the holy relics were on display at the Church of St. Josaphat, nearly 150,000 faithful arrived from all parts of Ukraine to offer their personal prayers at the reliquary of the Blessed Nicholas, known also as St. Nicholas the Miracle Worker. Since the deposition of the relics of Blessed Venerable Martyr Nicholas Charnetsky, the Church of St. Josaphat had become a popular pilgrimage site for thousands of faithful from all of Ukraine. From morning to late evening, people came to pray at the reliquary of the Blessed Nicholas in the hope of recovering their spiritual strength and physical health. The Ukrainian Catholic University (UCU) in Rome celebrated its 40th anniversary on December 6-7. Professors, senators and students of the Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv traveled to the Eternal City for the festivities. They were joined by representatives of the St. Sophia Association, which is now the owner and caretaker of the university's premises in Rome. Professors from various Roman universities, Ukrainians presently working in Italy and other interested parties also took part. Cardinal Husar presented special awards to Bishop Ivan Choma and the Rev. Dr. Muzyczka, who had been close co-workers with Patriarch Josyf Slipyj in the creation of the UCU in Rome. A religious event held in Uman, Ukraine, a sleepy county seat of 88,000 two hours' drive south of the Kyiv metropolis, also made headlines in 2003. More than 14,000 Hasidic Jews, the overwhelming majority from Israel and around 90 percent of them members of the Bratslav branch of Hasidism, gathered on September 26-28 to celebrate the Jewish New Year, or Rosh Hashanah. They came to celebrate the beginning of the Jewish year 5764, explained Dov Nathan Kramer, the director of the International Charitable Fund of Rebbe Nachmann, considered the central organization of the Bratslav Hasidic movement, which does not acknowledge a leader other than the founder of the movement. The gathering, one of the strongest established religious traditions in Ukraine, has occurred every year since 1812, except for the 70 years of Soviet rule when the celebration was banned. For the most part it involves much prayer at the burial site of the group's founder, Rebbe Nachmann, in compliance with instructions that he set out for his followers before his death. But it also includes an upbeat atmosphere, light-hearted communal meals in a huge cafeteria, ritual cleansings and the ancient Jewish tradition of bringing in the New Year to the sound of a Ram's Horn. The Orthodox Jews who gather in Uman belong to the branch of Hasidic Jewry that identifies itself as Bratslav Hasidism. Rebbe Nachmann, who developed the movement, was a recognized Jewish mystic and holy man born in 1772, who lived in Bratslav, Ukraine (hence the name), located not far from Uman. The Hasidic Jews of the Bratslav movement have gathered in Uman for Rosh Hashanah every year since Rebbe Nachmann instructed them to do so. Celebrations on a large scale did not occur only when Uman was considered a closed city during the Soviet era and authorities forbade non-residents to enter. However, even then, the daring and the most faithful would find a way to Rebbe Nachmann's grave, which was hidden in the garden of a local Jew who acted as the caretaker. Since Ukraine's independence was re-established in 1991, the pilgrimage tradition has resumed and taken on a grand scale. Today around 15,000 of the world's 20,000 Bratslav Hassid, as well as followers of other Hasidic movements, travel annually to Uman for the Jewish New Year. The Weekly also reported that the Armenian Cathedral of the Dormition of the Mother of God in Lviv was reconsecrated on May 18. After 50 years in government possession, the historic cathedral was recently returned to the local Armenian community in the largest and most important city in western Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's first president, Charles Aznavour, a French singer of Armenian descent, and other representatives of Armenia and the Armenian diaspora from around the globe were present at the ceremony. The ceremonial opening of the church began with a procession of about 1,000 people through Lviv's historic city center. An icon of the 17th century spiritual and cultural leader Metropolitan Petro Mohyla, prepared by monks of the Romanian Orthodox Church in honor of his canonization in Romania, was presented to the Annunciation Church of the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy on January 14. The Romanian Orthodox Church had canonized Metropolitan Mohyla a saint on October 13, 2002, during a ceremony in his hometown of Iasi, present-day Romania, assigning December 22 as the date of his commemoration. In 1997 a synod of the Romanian Church had recognized the canonization of Mohyla by the Ukrainian Orthodox. The metropolitan was canonized by both the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate (1996) and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate. Representatives of the Ukrainian Embassy in Romania presented a stylized likeness of the legendary metropolitan of Kyiv, Halychyna and all of Rus' to the Annunciation Church of the National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy. Today known as the Church of St. Petro Mohyla, the church honors Metropolitan Mohyla, who founded the Kyiv academy that bears his name in 1631. Monks of the monastery in Iasi created the fresco. Metropolitan Mohyla, who had been appointed the archimandrite of the Kyivan Cave Monastery in 1627, in 1631 established the Kyivan Cave Monastery School. In 1632 the Kyivan Cave Monastery School merged with the Kyiv Epiphany Brotherhood School to create a college. With time it became the Kyiv Mohyla Academy - eventually the largest educational and scholarly center in Eastern Europe. Ukraine's National Committee on Religious Matters at a press conference on February 4 released official information on the development of religious institutions in Ukraine in 2002 and presented statistics on religious organizations in Ukraine as of January 1, 2003. According to the report, Ukraine is currently home to 28,567 religious organizations, including 27,480 religious communities that profess 54 different religions. More than 1,000 religious communities of the total number are unregistered. During 2002 the number of religious organizations increased by 5.7 percent, constituting 1,423 organizations, 726 (52.4 percent) of which are Orthodox communities. Among these Orthodox communities, 525 (72.3 percent) belong to the Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP). The total number of UOC-MP communities in Ukraine is 10,040. The Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church ranks second with its 3,334 communities. The Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Kyiv Patriarchate has 3,196 communities; the Baptist Church - 2,272; the Pentecostal Church of Evangelical Faith - 1,366; the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church - 1,110; the Seventh-Day Adventist Church - 928; the Roman Catholic Church - 847; and the Charismatic Church - 790. There are also 262 Jewish communities and 462 Muslim communities in Ukraine, 320 of which are in Crimea. New religious organizations in Ukraine constitute 4.5 percent of the total number. The number of religious buildings in Ukraine has increased by 478 and currently constitutes 19,112. Most religious communities, however, are not fully provided with church buildings. The Subcarpathian Reformed Church is the only religious organization whose needs in church buildings are completely satisfied, according to the report. Today, 2,232 religious buildings are being built in Ukraine, among which 439 are funded by the state. The Weekly also reported that a multi-faceted missionary movement had achieved successes in Ukraine and had brought to the country several non-denominational and U.S.-based religions not previously known there, among them strong evangelical and charismatic movements including Embassy of the Kingdom of God and a Presbyterian church. A study by the Religious Information Service of Ukraine showed that about 50 percent of Ukrainians claim membership in one of the three Orthodox Churches that exist in Ukraine today and about 6 percent to 8 percent say they belong to the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, with fewer than 2 percent claiming Roman Catholic Church affiliation. The study stated that there were probably no more than 700,000 to 800,000 Protestant believers in Ukraine. However, another survey, this one conducted by the Association for Spiritual Renewal in Moscow, disputed the figures for the number of Protestant believers and noted a 33 percent increase in membership and a doubling in median attendance in what they termed Evangelical Christian-Baptist Churches. In Ukraine, these Churches consist of the traditional Protestant religious confessions, such as the Baptists, who have been in Ukraine since the mid-19th century; the Lutherans, who have been here since at least the 16th century; and the Seventh Day Adventists, who appeared in the 1880s. But they also include an influx of missionary movements from Africa and the United States, bearing witness to the particular beliefs of the Presbyterian Church, the Church of the Latter-Day Saints (Mormons), Jehovah's Witnesses and other religions further on the fringe, including homegrown religious sects such as the White Brotherhood, which achieved notoriety in Kyiv in 1992-1993. Ukraine has also seen the explosion of charismatic religions, such as the Pentecostals, who believe in communion with God through hypnotic trances and speaking in tongues. For example, the Embassy of the Kingdom of God has become among the most popular of the Pentecostal Churches. Its founder, Pastor Sunday Adelaja, a 36-year-old Nigerian from a religious Christian family who studied journalism in Miensk, Belarus, came to Kyiv after the Soviet Union fell. In 1993 he began a bible-reading group. Pastor Sunday claims that his Church has more than a million believers scattered across Ukraine in more than 200 communities. In Kyiv alone he claims more than 20 churches and 20,000 members. The Church funds a rehabilitation center for detoxification and counseling for alcoholics and drug addicts, and a center for women and homeless children. There is also a soup kitchen that feeds 1,500 to 2,000 people daily. In other news related to our Churches, All Saints Camp of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. celebrated its patron's feast day and the 25th anniversary of the camp's spiritual ministry among youth on Sunday, July 22. Several buses and hundreds of people arrived in Emlenton, Pa., the site of the camp, to share in the mutual celebration and memories that formed and continue to form generations of faithful of the UOC. Metropolitan Constantine, Archbishop Antony and clergy from the western Pennsylvania, Penn-Ohio and New York deaneries of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A. celebrated divine liturgy. In his remarks, Metropolitan Constantine, the ruling hierarch of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the U.S.A., journeyed back 25 years to when he blessed the camp property and reflected upon the importance of the spiritual, social and national achievements of the campers and their counselors over these 25 years. The Detroit Ukrainian Catholic Deanery, at the invitation of the Very Rev. Dean Basil Salkowski, OSBM, pastor of St. Josaphat Ukrainian Catholic Church, on June 1 hosted a special banquet in honor of the first official visit of the primate of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, Cardinal Husar, at St. Josaphat Church Center in Warren, Mich. The banquet was also a fund-raiser for the new informational center and Cathedral of the Holy Resurrection of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church being built in Kyiv, Ukraine. With a capacity audience of parishioners and faithful attending, the event was opened by master of ceremonies Vasyl Kolodchin, world head of the Ukrainian Patriarchal Society, who greeted the gathering. A total of $200,000 was raised - a gift to Ukraine's Holy Resurrection Sobor project from the Detroit area Ukrainian Catholic faithful. Not to be outdone, the New York community raised nearly $500,000 - $250,000 of the total came from the Selfreliance New York Federal Credit Union. The contribution was presented during Cardinal Husar's visit to New York City, where a reception and dinner took place on December 14. The Ukrainian Catholic primate's trip also encompassed other parishes that belong to the Stamford Eparchy, including Yonkers, N.Y., Hartford, Conn., and Albany, N.Y., which raised $100,000, $60,000 and $40,000, respectively, for the patriarchal cathedral and residence in Kyiv. Other large donors to this project were the parishes of the Philadelphia Archeparchy ($300,000) and the community of Parma, Ohio (nearly $200,000). In addition, the Roman Catholic Church in the United States donated $325,000. Article copyright The Ukrainian Weekly.",NA,Ukrainian Weekly,2004-01-11,1
"About ten years ago, Armenia, Karabagh and Azerbaijan placed their signatures on the cease-fire document with a commitment to conduct negotiations to find a peaceful solution to the Karabagh conflict. Since then, mediators from the US, Russia and France, under the auspices of the Minsk Group, have been trying to bring the conflicting sides to a mutually acceptable agreement. The members of the Minsk Group counties include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Turkey and the United States. Each of them has its own political agenda and strategy, dictated by economic priorities and national interests. Since the inception of the Minsk Group, new emerging international events and upheavals continue to reshape old political doctrines, and new global and regional alliances have reemerged. The collapse of Communism and the demise of the U.S.S.R. has created new opportunities for the U.S., the world's only superpower. The surge of Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism has brought new challenges, with unsettling effects on U.S. national interests. In its quest to claim control over the Caspian and Middle Eastern oil resources, the U.S. has aimed to neutralize those challenges coming from reemerging Russia, hostile Iran, and Islamic militants and fundamentalists. Having taken the offensive, the U.S. has begun to project its military might and spread its political influence in the region. U.S. TAKES INITIATIVE The U.S. took the initiative as Washington installed pro-Western leaders in the Balkan countries, including Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania and the republics of the former Yugoslavia, including Macedonia, Slovenia, Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro. The same scenario was staged in the Caucasian country of Georgia. This time, the U.S. orchestrated the downfall of onetime friend, the aging Eduard Shevardnadze, and promoted the election of Washington's protégée, Mikhail Saakashvili, to the Presidency of Georgia, who won the January 4, 2004 election by a landslide. The U.S. continues to penetrate further into the regions that used to be Russian turf, and has formed a military alliance with Azerbaijan and the Central Asian country of Uzbekistan. Meanwhile, following the events of 9/11, facing an unprecedented terrorist threat from Islamic fundamentalists and Al-Qaeda, the U.S. was forced to break the will and sources of Islamic militants, invaded Afghanistan and occupied Iraq. These new realities created an opportunity as well as a danger for Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh. In order to achieve geostrategic and economic dominance, multinational oil companies, multinational corporations, and the only global superpower, the United States of America, are trying to neutralize the influence of the emerging European Union, resurgent Russia and China, thus creating a rivalry reminiscent of the Cold War period. This competition and confrontation worsened during the Iraqi invasion, when the U.S. didn't get its anticipated support; as a consequence, the victor denied the defiler the right to participate in the postwar reconstruction projects in Iraq. Only the European Union, Russia and China are poised to challenge the U.S. supremacy; the rest of the nations of the world are acting like pawns or proxies and are serving the interests of the global or challenging regional powers on the grand chessboard of the world's political stage. A PLETHORA OF BOOKS Recently, many political scientists, academics, think tanks, former statesmen and diplomats have published numerous books and articles about current world affairs, touching on the same topics. The policy makers have expressed their ideas as to how to reshape the new world order and how to control global conflicts, world energy resources, how to advance economic and political interests at a global conflicts, world energy resources, how to advance economic and political interests at a global level, and how to eliminate the danger from Islamic militants and international terrorists. A brief glance at the titles of those publications will give readers a sufficient idea as to how today's world events are being discussed and reshaped and what to expect in the next several decades in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and Americas. A few of the titles of these books are as follows: When Corporations Rule the World written by David C. Korten, The Globalization Reader by Frank J. Lechner and John Boli, A World Without Walls by Mike Moore, Oligarchs by David E. Hoffman, The New Eurasia by David T. Twining, Russia's Muslim Frontiers by Dale F. Eickelman, Russia Faces NATO Expansion by J.L. Black, and the Grand Chessboard by Zbigniew Brzezinski. By reading these books one can learn how the oil giants and multinational corporations are trying to impose rules on world trade and commerce, and are establishing control of financial markets, and future economic and political trends in every part of the globe (globalization). Hegemony of a New Type is reshaping Superpower Politics and Geo-strategy Imperatives are determining relations between rival Superpowers or Superpower and Client States. OPPORTUNITIES AND DANGERS The policymakers in Yerevan and Stepanakert are facing new opportunities, as well as urgency among them as they try to pursue a complementary policy' to appease both the U.S. and Russia, the countries that are home to 1 million and 2 million Armenians, respectively. Georgia and Azerbaijan are already declaring their intention to join NATO and to enter into a military and political alliance with the U.S. Washington's protégée Mikhail Saakashvili has already been elected as the President of Georgia and Ilham Aliyev, the President of Azerbaijan, similarly has the endorsement of Washington. As far as Robert Kocharian, the President of Armenia, is concerned, neither Washington nor Moscow want changes; the alternative for the U.S. was an election of more pro-Moscow elements, while, for Russia, the election of untested new leadership at the time of crumbling Russian influence in the Caucasus was not desirable. Facing threats from both Turkey and Azerbaijan, Armenia is currently depending totally on Russia's alliance and protection. However, Yerevan also realizes that, in the past, Moscow double-crossed Armenia for its own national interests and wouldn't hesitate to do so if an occasion arises. AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION At this point Yerevan is studying an alternative settlement plan for a solution of the Karabagh dispute. According to the United States Institute of Peace, key points are: Both Azeris and Armenians are claming absolute historic ownership of the region, thus creating a stalemate. OSCE mediation so far didn't achieve the desired result since both sides are insisting on incompatible conditions. The Armenians will not discuss the withdrawal of their troops form occupied territories until Azerbaijan recognizes Nagorno-Karabagh's independence, and the Azeris, in turn, are insisting on Azerbaijan's complete territorial integrity and its sovereignty over Karabagh. Karabagh rejected the phased approach plan, proposed by the Minsk Group, entailing an Armenian withdrawal from seven Azeri provinces, followed by a discussion of the final status of Nagorno Karabagh. There are a number of obstacles to reaching a settlement of the dispute. These include mutual and historical mistrust between the Armenians and the Azeris. Armenians feel extremely vulnerable, surrounded by Azeris and Turks. There has been a tendency in Baku to overestimate the influence of oil and oil pipeline routes in the international arena, and the Azeris are anticipating that Americans, Russians, Turks, and international community will solve their problems. Azerbaijan must contend with its position as loser in the Karabagh conflict. The knowledge that they essentially lost that was has led the Azeris to be fearful of the possibility that their nation could disintegrate. Clearly the absence of security guarantees is a crucial obstacle to resolving this conflict. The United States Institute of Peace concludes: In the end, it is doubtful that there is any resolution possible other than the most recent plan proffered by the OSCE's Minsk Group. The three parties (Armenia, Karabagh and Azerbaijan) will have to agree that there should be recognition of the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, coupled with actual self-government for Karabagh by local Armenians. Only a settlement guaranteeing local Armenians sovereignty over Karabagh with de jure Azerbaijani control has a chance of lasting more than a few short years into the future, thus preventing the current dispute from being passed on to future generations. RESEMBLANCE TO MARESCA'S PROPOSAL All these proposals closely resemble John J. Maresca's proposal, that Nagorno-Karabagh would be reconstituted as the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh (RNK), a self-governing legal entity within and freely associated with the sovereign Republic of Azerbaijan. Armenian and Azerbaijan would sign a treaty on mutual transit rights across each other's territory. Refugees would be permitted to return to their homes, with certain villages designated for international monitoring. All of Armenia and Azerbaijan, including RNK, would be a free trade area. All agreed arrangements would be included in two documents to be the basis for a diplomatic solution signed at the Minsk Conference. The OSCE and the UN Security Council would in the Caucasus [at the present the U.S. is involved on the ground in Georgia and, in the future, may get involved on the ground in Azerbaijan - M.A.], but should take the lead in building ground road connections between RNK and Armenia, and between Azerbaijan and Nakhichevan, and enclave of Azerbaijan. A donors conference would be organized to raise funding for the economic reconstruction of the region. Since the inception of Maresca's plan, we were told about the existence of the Paul Goble Plan, and, lately, the Paris and Key West agreements [Its existence is confirmed by international mediators and Armenia but denied by Azerbaijan]. Russia's resurgence as a regional power player, and the undisputed U.S. supremacy as kingmaker in global and regional disputes and arbitrations, leaves no doubt that, sooner or later, the Karabagh dispute will be resolved. The question is, are the mediators going to stick to their promise that the three parties (Armenia, Karabagh and Azerbaijan) would be in agreement with the mediators' proposals? Or with outsiders who dictated based on their perceived geo-strategic and economic interests. Policy makers in Yerevan and Stepanakert have so far successfully prevented any imposition of a solution by outsiders, yet emerging new realities may create new circumstances that may alter the present political and military balance in favor of another party or parties.

"Before and during the Iraqi war, President Bush and his administration frequently and repeatedly used the terminology Coalition Forces and Coalition of Willing to describe the degree of participation of foreign governments, categorized as active supporters of political supporters of his mission. After the defeat and capture of most of the Iraqi ex-leaders, the moment of truth has come. Which nations are going to take part in the reconstruction of the war-shattered Iraqi economy, industry and entire infrastructure, the cost of which will amount to the staggering eighty billion dollars. Naturally, France, Germany, and Russia are excluded due to their stubborn opposition to U.S. war efforts, but Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan, along with many others, are included on the list of nations that will be permitted to take part in reconstruction projects. Even though Armenia opened its air space to U.S. warplanes by offering landing rights for refueling, it is excluded from taking part in the Iraqi rebuilding. Yet, a careful study of abundantly available documents reveals that Armenia has been the target of international terrorists yet Azerbaijan has been the clandestine supporter of international anarchists. It appears to be paradoxical to classify the collaborators of terrorists as coalition partner, yet exclude Armenia, the real friend of the U.S., from this undertaking. ARMENIA AND AL-QAEDA We all remember that Armenia condemned the September 11th incidents in the strongest terms and pledged its unequivocal support for U.S. military action against Al Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan. We also know that Armenians fought ferocious battles against Al Qaeda-trained Afghan mujahedin and Chechen fighters during the Karabagh war when Azeris, as a last-ditch effort, paid five thousand dollars to each Afghani to turn the tide of war to their advantage. Al-Qaeda's involvement in the Chechen war against the Russians began nine years before the September 11th incidents, yet no one at that time considered Islamic fundamentalist war against Christians, but it was. Between 1992-1994, Azeris, armed to the teeth with the support of Turkish and Chechen volunteers, hired Afghan Al-Qaeda-trained mujahedins, who not only attacked and burned every Armenian village and settlement, but bombarded Stepanakert every day for over hundred days in a row to break the will of the Armenian defenders, who vowed that they will clear Karabagh from Armenian population. Many observers later realized that Baku was cooperating with the terrorists from the beginning. It is now clear that the leadership in Baku maintained vast contact with the underworld of international terrorism. Azerbaijan's Ministries of Defense and Interior were actively recruiting Al-Qaeda-trained mercenaries from Afghanistan and Pakistan by bringing them to the Caucasus to fight along with the Chechens against the Russians and Karabagh Armenians. According to independent observers, the Azeri Defense Ministry brought about 2,500 of those battle-hardened, fundamentalist terrorists to the battlefront in Karabagh in 1993. Most of them belonged to Hezb-e Islamia's armed formations under the command of Afghanistan's notorious warlord Gulbuddin Hekmetyar and trained in the camps supervised by Osama bin Laden, one of the United States' chief terrorist suspects. AL-QAEDA AND AZERIS It is a known fact that Al-Qaeda established an office in Baku, and Osama bin Laden's emissaries were shuttling between Istanbul-Baku-Riyadh and Kabul, laundering money, smuggling opium, weapons and ammunitions, and planning terrorist attacks in deeper, Russian-controlled Chechnya, Dagestan, and North Ossetia, drawing battle plans against the Georgians in Abkhazia and Armenians in Karabagh. Azeris also played dirty with Russians, while asking for their help to subdue Armenians. Azeri intelligence continued to support Chechen separatists and terrorists both financially and politically. The branches of terrorist Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamic Path Party had their headquarters in Baku, where Wahabist Arabs, members of Hezbollah and Chechens, Al-Qaeda-trained Afghan mujahedins were conspiring to plan terrorist operations in Armenia, Western Europe, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Tanzania, Kenya, Sudan, Egypt, Israel, Tajikistan and the Philippines. Besides fighting against the Armenians in Karabagh, these terrorists were also conducting numerous terrorist attacks inside Armenia. Between 1993-1995, more than eighty terrorist bombing attacks on trains, rail lines and gas pipelines disrupted the flow of fuel and gas supplies from Georgia to Armenia. Russia and the U.S. were very much concerned with Azerbaijan's involvement in terrorist activities in the Russian-controlled Caucasus and the regions of the Middle East in the U.S. sphere of influence. In its guide, Patterns of Global Terrorism-1999, the U.S. Department of State indicated: Azerbaijan served as a logistic hub for international mujahedin with ties to terrorist groups, some of whom supported Chechen insurgency in Russia. Now it is a known fact that Azerbaijan's branch of the Islamic Jihad organization, which by then had merged with Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda, reportedly coordinated the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people and wounded 4,600. The murderous activities of Al Qaeda-trained Chechen terrorists in the Russian Federation, including bombings of apartment complexes, theaters, public places and hostage taking in hospitals and schools, were also coordinated by the Al-Qaeda-controlled terrorist headquarters in Baku. In the words of Islamic extremists in Baku, Azerbaijan is part of the global Intifada against Christians and Jews. U.S. REWARDING OF AZERBAIJAN PARADOXICAL All this explains why President Bush's administration wanted to repeal Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. His argument was to give access and opportunity to the U.S. to fight against international terrorism and to bring Azeri land and Caspian territorial waters under control to prevent terrorists from increasing their activities in the region. This argument not only has its merits but also bears acknowledgement to the fact that Azerbaijan's territory was used by terrorist and, in fact, is still being used by terrorists. After reviewing and analyzing the above facts, it appears to be paradoxical that Washington is rewarding Azerbaijan for paying lip service during the Iraqi war, while totally ignoring the fact that they collaborated with international terrorists. Yet the Armenians, who once fought against terrorist, are still threatened by them, and are ready to face challenges, were not considered to be part of the antiterrorist coalition. Yossef Bodansky, Director of Research at the International Strategic Studies Association and a onetime Director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare at the US House of Representatives, was aware of Azeri complicity earlier than any other terrorist expert. He shared his knowledge with many important people in Washington. His observations have been quoted by many authors and published in books about Al-Qaeda. Readers may refer to the following books: Inside Al-Qaeda by Rohan Gunaratna; Reaping the Whirlwind-Afghanistan, Al Qa'ida and the Holy War by Michael Griffin; Unholy Wars by John K. Cooley; and The Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington. REAL DANGER OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISM & TERRORISM The general message in all these publications is that the danger from Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism is real. They are part of the global Intifida against civilized Christian world, Jewry and even secular Islam. The sad part is, when terrorism was directed exclusively against Israel, Armenia, and, later on, Russia, others, including the US and leading Western leaders, didn't consider this terrorist threat as their problem. For political expediency, they even gave momentary thought that this might have unsettling effects on Russia, the onetime adversary power. Now, after September 11, everyone sees that the threat is universal and recognizes no boundaries. The Bush administration should be supported and applauded for efforts to punish international terrorists and eradicate terrorism. In this war, all mankind has a stake and responsibility. Yet, in these efforts, America has the burden and responsibility to identify and recognize that those who supported terrorism in the past have now jumped on the bandwagon, while the ones that truly suffer under terrorism, like the Armenians and Jews, tried for a long time to convince U.S. leaders that one way to fight against terrorism is to acknowledge all forms of terrorism, including state terrorism, in past and present forms. Reaffirmation and recognition of the Armenian Genocide is part of this process. It gives a strong message to future would-be state-sponsored genocide perpetrators that crimes of this nature will not go unpunished.

"ATHENS, Greece - A special tribunal convicted the mastermind, chief gunman and 13 other members of the 17 November terrorist cell on December 8 for killings and attacks spanning more than a generation, capping the prosecution of a terrorist group which taunted authorities for decades. Alexandros Giotopoulos - considered 17 November's ringleader - and Demetris Koufodinas, believed to be the group's key hitman, have since been sentenced to life imprisonment for their roles in a rash of violent crimes which was initiated by the assasination of Athens CIA Station Chief Richard Welch in December of 1975 and culminated with the murder of a British Defense Attache, Brigadier General Stephen Saunders, in June of 2000. Giotopoulos, 59, and Koufodinas, 45, were found guilty along with 13 other members of the radical Marxist group for multiple bombings, bank robberies and murders. The three-man court convicted Giotopoulos of instigating 19 murders (to include that of General Saunders) and Koufodinas of carrying out 13. Prosecutor Christos Lambrou had demanded multiple and consecutive life sentences for both men (21 for Giotopoulos and 14 for Koufodinas), as well as for four other members of the group. Greece does not have the death penalty (neither does any member state of the European Union). The remaining nine members could receive jail terms of up to 18 years, although four members will serve reduced sentences for cooperating with authorities. Another four members of the group were acquitted. Nearly two dozen prominent Greeks, as well as Turkish and American diplomats, were among 17 November's victims. In a landmark ruling which Greece hopes will allay fears of terrorism before next summer's Olympic Games, the Greek court found the 15 men guilty of a string of assassinations, car bombings and rocket attacks which stretched over nearly three decades. The verdicts, delivered by a judge here in rapid-fire style without commentary, brought an abrupt close to a trial which had riveted Greece for nine months, with nearly 500 witnesses, 10,000 pages of evidence and a carnival atmosphere which threatened, at times, to spiral into chaos. The rulings - following the trial, which was held in a bunker-like prison courtroom - were touted by the Greek Government as evidence of the Hellenic Republic's commitment to fighting terrorism ahead of the 2004 Olympics, scheduled to be held in Athens next August 13-29. They also mark the end of one of the last major prosecutions against European militants inspired by 1970's visions of Marxism and social revolution. 11,000 YEARS Mr. Lambrou had asked for a total of 11,000 years in prison for the 15 men who were found guilty. Democracy has defeated terrorism, said Cristos Protopapas, the Greek Government's Chief Spokesman. Terrorism received a decisive blow and, of course, Greece is now viewed through-out the world as one of the safest countries, something very significant, especially in light of the Olympic Games. In the past, Greece was accused of lacking the political will to attack domestic terror groups led by the notorious group, which was named for the day in 1973 when the country's then-military rulers crushed a student-led protest. Greek justice spoke today, said Athens Mayor Dora Bakoyianni, whose husband Pavlos, a spokesman for the conservative New Democracy party, was killed by the group in 1989. He was among 23 people slain by 17 November since the ambush of Mr. Welch, who was returning home from a Christmas party in 1975. From there, the death toll grew to include three more American envoys, two Turkish diplomats and prominent Greek political and business figures. Brigadier Saunders was the last victim of 17 November's 28-year campaign of terror. He was shot four times by two assailants riding a motorcycle while traveling to work four summers ago during the morning rush hour on the busy Kiffisias Avenue in Athens. He died three-and-a-half hours later. But Greece's statute of limitations meant the trial of the 19 defendants could only cover acts committed during the past 20 years. The three-judge panel - working under Greece's new anti-terrorism laws - issued blanket convictions against Giotopoulos, marked as the leader of the group, and its main assassin, Koufodinas, who was linked to many of the group's slayings and was known by the code name, poison hand. Four defendants were acquitted for lack of evidence, including the only female suspect, Koufodinas's wife. The entire group sat stone-faced as the head judge took more than 90 minutes to read the verdicts from hundreds of charges. The decision was expected. I was condemned from the start, said the silver-haired Giotopoulos, a Frenchborn academic who lived under an alias in Greece for decades. Giotopoulos has stead-fastly denied any links to the group. But others freely acknowledged their roles. Koufodinas told the court he took political responsibility for all the group's actions and was defiantly unrepentant to the end. We don't care about the court's judgment, he said. We care about the judgment of the Greek people. Heather Saunders, the widow of the group's last victim, said relatives of those killed would never fully recover from their ordeal. There's goodness knows how many children, how many parents. They will all carry this scar for the rest of their lives, she told British Broadcasting Corporation radio after the verdicts. After the death of her husband, Mrs. Saunders' tearful public appeal for justice helped spur authorities to take more decisive action and turn public opinion away from the militant group. The gunmen had enjoyed a degree of sympathy in the years following the 1967-74 military government, which was supported by the United States. 17 November professed a mix of hard-line Marxism, Greek nationalism and opposition to the imperialist power of the United States and its main allies. The militants also mocked authorities by evading arrests and building a reputation as the untouchable cousins of other European guerrilla groups: Germany's Baader-Meinhoff gang and Italy's Red Brigades. Come and get us, 17 November taunted authorities in a 1999 communique. A botched bombing last year began a wave of arrests. The ordinary backgrounds of those captured stunned Greece: hitman Koufodinas was a beekeeper; there was also a mechanic, a switch-board operator and a byzantine iconographer among the core members. The trial was a key test for new anti-terrorism laws which permit non-jury trials to avoid possible intimidation or tampering. The judges banned all broadcast coverage from the courtroom. I'd like to thank the Lord that I was saved and thank the court for convicting them, said former New Democracy Deputy Lefteris Papadimitriou, who was shot and wounded by 17 November in 1992. LINGERING RISKS But terrorism experts in the United States, Israel and Greece say the verdicts do little to address the bigger security threat to the Olympics, which comes from international terror organizations like Al Qaeda, not homegrown militants like those from similar outlaw gangs. Nor are they ready to discount a lingering risk from this group, which, though badly weakened by the arrest of one of its founders and its chief assassin, is still thought to have members at-large. The Greek Government thinks this was a big success for them, but to my mind that is very much exaggerated, said Shabtai Shavit, a former head of Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. One can not rule out the possibility that, somewhere, there are still operatives of this organization thinking, plotting and planning to wreak havoc on a major event like the Olympic Games. The Hellenic Police is still hunting for other members of the group who are likely to be peripheral figures. Still, most Greek officials characterize the judgments against 17 November as a turning point. One of Europe's most elusive terror groups, they argue, has been wiped out. The crackdown, they contend, will also lead Al Qaeda and other foreign terrorist groups to stop viewing Greece, with its long coastline, porous borders and proximity to Turkey and the Middle East, as an inviting target. I believe firmly that the verdicts send out a message that Greece has a new-found determination to fight against terrorism, said Public Order Minister Giorgos Floridis in an interview. We believe that traditional terrorism, as we knew it in Greece, no longer exists. Mr. Floridis added that Greece was now focused on foreign terrorists. In addition to Al Qaeda, Greek officials believe that other Muslim militants could target athletes from individual delegations. Mr. Floridis also said he had no evidence of any planned attacks. Athens is spending more than $750 million on security, an unprecedented sum and the most ever spent for an Olympiad - three and a half times the budget of the 2000 Games in Sydney, Australia. It plans to hire 50,000 security staff members, four times more than were used in any previous Games. Greece is also working closely with other countries to compensate for its own limited security apparatus, and to spread the burden of securing the Games.

"On Sunday, December 1, 2003, His Holiness Karekin II, Supreme Patriarch and Catholicos of All Armenians, returned to the Mother See following his meeting in Moscow with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church and the spiritual leaders of the Caucasus. The meeting took place on November 26 in the Monastery of St. Daniel, by the invitation of His Holiness Alexy II, Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia, and with the participation of the Catholicos of All Armenians Karekin II; His Holiness Ilia II, Patriarch of All Georgia; and Sheikh UI Islam Allah-Shukur Pashazade, Spiritual Leader of Muslims in the Caucasus. During his visit to Moscow, the Pontiff of All Armenians also met with His Excellency Vladimir Putin, President of the Russian Federation. At the conclusion of the meeting, the religious leaders signed a common appeal, the text of which appears below: MEETING OF THE RELIGIOUS LEADERS OF AZERBAIJAN, ARMENIA, GEORGIA AND RUSSIA APPEAL It is not for the first time that religious leaders have gathered in Moscow to seek together way to promote a settlement of conflicts and to establish peace and accord in the Caucasus. The Armenian Apostolic Church, the Russian Orthodox Church and the Islamic community in Azerbaijan have a long tradition of meetings on the highest level, which have made their own contribution on the settlement of inter-ethnic conflicts in the Caucasus. Today we welcome to this process the Georgian Orthodox Church renowned for her long peacemaking traditions. With hope, we expect the Second Inter-religious Peace Forum of the Commonwealth of the Independent States to take place on March 2-4, 2004, and call upon all the religious leaders of these countries to take part in it. The sensible position taken by the Muslim and Christian religious leaders in the Caucasus and the continued Christian-Muslim dialogue in the region have prevented the inter-ethnic disputes from growing into a total Christian-Muslim conflict. However, tension in the Caucasus continues, with Abkhazia, Karabagh, Chechnya and South Ossetian Tzkhinvali regions remaining as bleeding wounds for our peoples. We thank the Most high for the absence of large-scale hostilities in these regions today. However, there are still forces carrying death and destruction. Blood has been shed in terrorist actions and bandit attacks. Thousands of people are suffering from lawlessness and disorder. Whole peoples find it difficult to return to normal religious, social, economic and political life. Terrorists, extremists and political radicals try to use ethnic and religious differences to justify their own purposes, which are far from true religion. An enemy image is made of people of other nationalities or other religions. People of other ethnic origin or faith are declared the main authors of political instability, economic ruin, spiritual decline and all the disasters that fall on a particular people. Struggle with enemy by all means is often presented as a holy task. Such exploitation of ethnic and religious ideals promoted an essentially totalitarian and nationalistic ideology. It works for the benefit of those forces that seek to drive religion away from the life of society and to sow distrust towards it. The authentic confession of faith leads neither to enmity, nor national or religious pride, but to sacrificial love, peacemaking and good-neighborliness. We declare again that terrorism cannot be warranted by religion. Those who resort to it have obliterated the image of the Creator in their souls. State should do everything possible to stop the activities of extremist groups, especially those controlled from outside of the Caucasus region. It is necessary, in particular, to establish control over arms in the region and to cut off the inflows of funds nourishing terrorism. We insist that all the existing problems should be settled on the basis of international law. We call upon politician to give a new impulse to the dialogue aimed at resolving all the differences impeding a lasting peace in the Caucasus. We declare that religious leaders are ready to take a most earnest part in such a dialogue. In order to put an end to conflicts in the Caucasus and to set the development of the people on a peaceful course, it is necessary to restore trust among people. To this end, it is important that ethnic minorities should be involved in all the spheres of public life, that freedom of faith and religious work should be ensured for them, that they should enjoy an opportunity for developing their culture and their language. The refugees and asylum seekers who wish to return to their homes should not be forgotten. Those who are responsible for mass murder of civilians should be punished according to the law. But no one should suffer an unjust punishment or persecution. Indeed, even those who transgress law and especially their families have the right to humane treatment. The culture of inter-ethnic communal life, which has always been so rich in the Caucasus, should be restored. In this connection, we would like to remind the powers that be, politicians, scholars, public figures, cultural workers and the mass media that a person cannot be elevated or humiliated on ethnic or confessional grounds. Every one of us is responsible before the Creator and people for every word we pronounce or publish. We believe the mass media, especially electronic ones, have done little to support inter-religious and inter-ethnic cooperation. A broad platform should be offered not to extremists who sow discord and enmity but to those leaders of religious and ethnic communities who preach peace and are set to maintain dialogue with one another. It is gratifying to see that the dramatic events in Georgia have not led to bloodshed. A great contribution to it has been made by the principled peace stand of the Georgian Church. We see in the peaceful outcome of the recent events a guarantee for an adequate resolution of other conflict situations in the Caucasus and continue to lift up prayers for the peace and prosperity of the Georgian people. We would like to remind each of you that a life in harmony and dignity is unthinkable without a solid moral foundation. Our peoples have always been strongly committed to the eternal moral values revealed to us by the Creator. These values used to form our culture and our way of life. That is why we should restore today the moral foundations of personal and public life and to suppose resolutely such vices as debauchery, sexual laxity, crime, violence and all-permissiveness. Faith and morality are inseparable from culture. We have to exert every effort to protect the national cultural heritage, especially the places of worship, veneration and burial. An inspired, moral and cultured person is a benefit to his or her people and will always live in peace with neighbors. Today we address the faithfully of our religions. Let nobody sow in your souls the seed of enmity towards people of other faiths and nationalities. Heal the wounds inflicted by conflicts through prayer, communion and joint work. Remember that our people have an ages-long experience of common life. Do not listen to those who kindle hatred. They pursue their own purposes, while you will suffer if you let them lead you in their strings. In our prayers we ask the Most High to put our rulers and our peoples on the path of peace and good-neighborliness.

"According to recent news, the Turkish Interior Ministry sent a top-secret memorandum to all the provincial governors and mayors of all cities, town and villages throughout Turkey, demanding the establishment of vital data card indexes on Christian minorities, mainly Greeks, Armenians, Assyrians and Chaldeans. Upon completion of the study, tabulated information and secret files on minorities will be sent to Ankara and will be stored in a centralized secret data bank. Those who recall the dark days of the Turkish government-sponsored Capital Tax imposed on Greeks, Armenians and Jews during the middle of WWII, to push them into bankruptcy, and later the September 6-7, 1955 government-organized anti-minority pogroms, which forced minorities to abandon their wealth and properties and leave Turkey, understand well the significance of this latest ominous Turkish government move. ONE STEP FORWARD, TEN STEPS BACKWARD In order to become a member of the European Union (EU), the Turks are taking one step forward by reforming their existing laws or drafting new ones. However, with the above-mentioned memorandum, they are taking ten steps backward. It is no secret that the EU member states are demanding that Ankara be compliant with the Copenhagen criteria, before Turkey's request to join the EU is considered. In order to make a good impression, the Turks are actually complying with their demands for reform, and are passing new laws or amending existing ones. Yet most of the changes remain on paper. The EU Commission set forth the following specific demands: or prohibit the arbitrary arrest and detention of dissidents; to prevent killings, beating and other violence against political prisoners; to abolish censorship of the news media, broadcasts, books, printed matter and publications; to prohibit the persecution and repression of Kurdish minorities; to keep the military out of politics and place the MGK-Turkish national Security Council under civilian control. Yet, as this recent memorandum reveals and although new laws are adopted, the Turkish mentality remains the same. The newly enacted laws are supposed to benefit the minorities as well, yet the contrary happens, and this new data-indexing system further violates their human rights. In a Turkish-Islamic-dominated society, where minorities are perceived as untrustworthy and a national security risk. The Turkish government has imposed numerous financial and artificial bureaucratic-administrative restraints on Armenians, Greeks and, to a lesser degree, Jews. In today's Turkey the minorities have ask to permission from the Directorate of Religious and Cultural Affairs to renovate their existing churches, schools and cultural centers. Minorities are also forced to declare an inventory of their wealth, that which belongs to their religious and cultural institutions. The vestments, crosses, chalices, candle holders, chandeliers, book bindings and holders, containing gold, silver, and precious stones such as emeralds, rubies and diamonds are counted, and they are all registered in the Turkish Directorate Office. The motivation behind this decision of the government to establish card indexes on minorities is to prepare a system to confiscate their wealth and properties when the occasion arises, to intimidate them, and force them to assimilate. THE CONVERSION OF MINORITIES Many Jews residing in Istanbul, Izmir and Adana have converted to Islam (Donme/Donmeh) and have assumed Turkish names. Numerous Armenians living in northeastern Anatolia have accepted the Muslim religion (Hamshins); thousands of Georgians and Greeks have accepted Mohammed as their prophet (Lazic people). The Christian Assyrians and Chaldeans are facing the same fate. The domineering Turkish-Islamic majority, by means of these pressure tactics and intimidation ploys, are pushing minorities to become converts and adopt Islamic-Turkish names. Only the Kurds are resisting the assimilationist and Turkification process. These kinds of pressure tactics on minorities are considered to be serious human rights violations. In their annual reports on Turkey, Amnesty International and Helsinki. Human Rights Watch have thousands of pages of documentation about repression, jailing and killing of journalists, political dissidents, and Kurdish political activists, either by government-sponsored death squads or village vigilantes, and by organized crime figures on government payroll. The complaints of victims or their relatives have fallen on deaf ears, and prosecutors and judges appointed by the government not only refuse to heed those complaints, but they also continue to enforce antiquated laws and a restrictive constitution, arbitrarily arresting and persecuting dissenters. They continue to pretend that newly amended laws are nonexistent. Even the Minister of Justice, commenting on Turkey's prevailing shortcomings to meet Copenhagen criteria, acknowledges openly in public that even though they keep changing the laws, they are not able to change the prevailing mentality. EFFECT OF KEMALISM AND KEMALIST PRINCIPLES Western critics are blaming Kemalism and Kemalist principles for preventing Turkey from accelerating and enacting reforms. European claim that the Kemalist ideology attempted to build a homogenous, modern society based on secular principles where a mono-ethnic Turkish national identity takes priority-and is considered as law. European critics continued, Both the Turkish legal system and the constitution are negatively influenced on two concepts: the supremacy of: the Sacred State and the Ideology of Kemalism, introduced by Mustafa Kemal, the founder of the modern Turkish state. The Sacred State mentality has created a preamble that No protection shall be given to thoughts or opinions that run counter to Turkish 'Sacred State' interests. Along with the fundamental principle of indivisibility of the Turkish state and territory, the historical moral value of Turkish nationalism (which accepts no wrong doing), or Principles, Reforms, and Modernism of Ataturk is the constitutional law of the Turkish Republic, which no one dares to amend. The Kemalist dogma that was established eight decades ago still controls today's Turkish society, constitution and judiciary. In today's Turkey, the role of the military is perceived to be the guardian of the Kemalist Principles and Sacred State, which wields its influence through the National Security Council (MGK-Milli Guvenlik Konseyi). MGK controls all foreign and domestic issues, including civic unions, education, academia, universities, print and publications, media and judiciary. MGK is also obsessed with Sacred State concept in order to preserve a mono-ethnic and homogenous Turkish identity in Turkey. Motivated by so-called security concerns, the MGK probably instructed the Ministry of Interior to send the above-mentioned memorandum to governors and mayors throughout Turkey, to prepare the card indexes on the minorities and to send the requested relevant information to centralized data banks in Ankara. This discriminatory and racist undertaking runs counter to European core values. This tactic of gathering information about minorities is perceived to be alien, the reflection of a perceived security threat to the Turkish State. This is reminiscent of activities of the Red Sultan Adulhamid II and the Young Turks' regime's activities, or of the Nazi and Bolshevik policy, to isolate and eventually eliminate the minorities under the pretext of so-called national security considerations. The minorities' historical experience in the past under both the Ottomans and modern Turkish Republic alike isn't very assuring. On the contrary it is very disturbing. Before it is too late, some preventive actions are needed. REACTION FROM ARMENIA & UPCOMING MEETING So far, only Armenians in Europe have reacted angrily and have registered their concerns to the European Commission and Presidium of the European union and Parliament. The Azg newspaper in Armenia, and the Marmara Armenian daily in Istanbul have informed the public about Turkish Interior Ministry's secret memorandum without comment. The Armenian public anticipates that the Armenian Assembly of America and Armenian National Committee of America will join the European Armenian Federation to register their protests against this recent ominous Turkish government move, and ask their Congressmen and Senators to request an explanation from the Ankara government. Time is running out. Turkish nationalists, through intimidation tactics, have already succeeded in assimilating and intimidating the national minorities. Now, with the above-mentioned memorandum, they are preparing new surprises. Some Armenians, who hope that once Turkey becomes a member of EU will act more responsibly and in a more civilized manner, may find out that this presumption might not correspond to the reality. They may have real difficulty defending their arguments once they realize that the Turkish Interior Ministry has called for the creation of 'Centralized Secret Files on Turkish Minorities, which his far-reaching serious implications. After the Turkish Education Ministry's decree that asked Turkish and Armenian students to write essays about Armenian atrocities against the Turkish-Islamic population during 19141923, including the Armenian rebellion and collaboration with the enemies of the Turks, as part of the Turkish school curriculum, this new measure will fan anti-Armenian hatred in young Turkish minds, and will again demonstrate that Turkish leaders have no good intentions toward Armenians. Following fake Turkish reconciliation gestures, we will soon witness another Turkish attempt to mislead Armenians and the world public opinion. This time, they are calling for a meeting among Turkish and Armenian historians to exchange relevant documents to see if the alleged Armenian genocide indeed happened. According to preliminary information, Vienna University will be hosting this meeting. Prof. Lavrenti Parseghian, Director of the Armenian genocide Museum in Yerevan, has already made it clear that the Armenian side does not object to this meeting. While not willing to debate the actual fact of the Armenian Genocide, the Armenian side is, however, ready to speak about the consequences of the Genocide on the Armenian people.

"A NORTHERN Ireland mother is facing deportation for allegedly traveling back to Ireland on vacation while awaiting a green card. Illinois-based Avril Guinn learned the day before Thanksgiving that she and her son are to be sent back to Ireland, even though an airline confirmed in writing that she had not used her return ticket to travel back to Ireland. Guinn, who is married to a former U.S. Marine, showed the Irish Voice a letter sent to her by Virgin Atlantic, confirming that neither her nor her son's return ticket coupons had been used. Virgin also confirmed that the flight schedule Guinn was alleged to have used to return to Ireland had not been used for more than a year. The case is one of several high profile disputes this year involving advanced parole - under U.S. law, permanent residency applicants cannot leave the country unless they receive advanced parole permission from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), formally the Immigration and Naturalization Service. If Guinn and her son are deported, her husband, Bill, will have to move to Northern Ireland to be with his wife and stepson. Guinn, based in Dixon, Illinois, has described the experience as a living nightmare and sharply criticized the Homeland Security Department for their treatment of the case. Guinn, who had a son through a previous relationship, met her husband through a pen pal ad in a publication for the U.S. armed forces, which her sister had arranged on her behalf. She had dumped out nearly all of the dozens of replies but found one weeks later under her sofa. I wrote to him to ask how he got my name and he wrote back saying that we should stay in contact now that I was already writing. I thought he was cocky but started writing, she said. Eventually, the two met and fell in love. According to USCIS documents, Guinn flew into O'Hare Airport on June 10, 2001 and claimed and applied for a green card two months later. However, the USCIS also claims that she flew back to Ireland on June 20, 2002, a claim Guinn strongly denies. However, Guinn was able to show that she did not have leave from work at that time. I was here all the time, working away. You would think it would be very easy for them to work that out, but they have decided to act on an unused plane ticket, she said. I just can't believe what I have had to deal with, it has been very, very stressful for the whole family, especially just before Christmas, she added. A workmate at the travel company where Guinn works described the experience as an ordeal. Guinn has since hired a lawyer and, on the advice of the local mayor, contacted the staff House Speaker Dennis Hastert, an Illinois representative. This is one of several advance parole legal cases involving Irish people this year. Irish woman Bridget Reuter has been stuck in Ireland for more than a year after she was blocked from returning to the U.S. following a family wedding in County Clare last November. Reuter, whose husband of more than 30 years is a former U.S. Air Force worker, has been living with her elderly mother in Longford while appealing for help from the Irish government. The Illinois USCIS came under severe criticism from a Chicago district judge earlier this year for revoking the advanced parole of a Muslim leader returning to the U.S. through Shannon Airport after visiting his terminally ill mother in Jordan. The judge described the treatment of Sabri Samirah as demeaning to the United States but his decision was overturned on appeal.

"SHE did it! Miss Ireland, Rosanna Davison, is officially the most fabulous woman on the planet after her win at the Miss World 2003 pageant staged in China on Saturday. It's the first time an Irish beauty queen has had her head topped with the tiara in the contest's 53-year history. Seeing as she won the Beach Beauty competition a few days previous - thanks in part to a skimpy yellow and pink bikini showing off her perfectly toned abs - it wasn't too much of a surprise that Rosanna came away with the top prize, beating out 105 other lovelies in the process. I was just so thrilled about being placed in the top five. I didn't think I'd get this far, she gushed after impressing the likes of celebrity judges Jackie Chan and Sex and the City author Candace Bushnell. The 19-year-old, whose future career prospects have definitely taken a turn for the better, is a journalism student at University College Dublin when she's not standing in front of a mirror. As we told you last week in this space, she's also the daughter of singer Chris de Burgh, who gave the world his Lady in Red song, and his wife Diane. The de Burghs, whose marriage was in crisis several years ago when Chris had an affair with Rosanna's nanny, were on hand to watch their daughter take her turn on the world stage. I am thrilled, ecstatic and overwhelmed, said Chris when his daughter was crowned. I love my daughter. She is so beautiful. And also taken. Rosanna's boyfriend, fellow student James Montgomery, was also in the audience to cheer her on. And how does it feel to be dating a Miss World winner? She has done Ireland proud. I'll be the envy of the world! he said. Miss Canada's fair maiden was the runner-up, and China's contestant finished third. The pageant was staged in China for the first time and was free of the controversy which plagued last year's event, when it had to be moved to London from Nigeria after heavy fighting broke out between Muslim and Christian groups. Rosanna will start cashing in on her new-found fame instantly. As winner she received E82,000 - close to $ 100,000 - and requests for appearances and endorsements are pouring in. But she'll also have her fair share of commitments to the Miss World organization, so shell take the next year off from school. At the moment I just feel like I need to sleep for a month, she said, but there's no rest for the beautiful. She's already done a round of publicity in London, and will return to Ireland on Wednesday of this week for a while. Rosie will be a committed ambassador as Miss World, said her dad. I know she will throw her heart and soul into the year and the work ahead. Though she paraded around the stage in a variety of gowns during the final two-hours of the competition, she was crowned in a fuschia pink number instead of the red one many pundits thought she'd wear in homage to her dad's song. And her 30-second speech about herself was to the point - Rosanna described herself as a fun, warm loving person who values honesty and integrity. Given that this was a beauty contest, there was all sorts of behind the scenes sniping at the result. Many felt it was rigged because Rosanna is the daughter of a famous, well-connected singer - even though he hasn't had a hit in years. Does anyone else think this pageant was a set-up from the very beginning? Miss World had the crown on her head from the start, said one angry fan on a website. Sounds like an angry stage mother of one of the other contestants. There was even a bit of sniping back in Ireland about Rosanna when she won her crown - again, the dad connection - and bookmakers back home took a beating as loads of bets were placed on her capturing the big one, We were well and truly cleaned out, said a spokesperson for the huge Paddy Power bookmakers. Hopefully Rosanna will just ignore the begrudgers and bask in the words of praise she's received from the likes of Irish President Mary McAleese and Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern. After all, she is a world-beater! Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Rosanna Davison receives congratulations.)","McGoldrick, Debbie",Irish Voice,2003-12-16,1
"It looks like the so-called Georgian Velvet Revolution will have its longtime unsetting effects and repercussions, not only in Georgia but also in the entire Caucasus region, where the national interests of the U.S. and Russia are obviously on a collision course. Former Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze's statement that Americans betrayed him, and his longtime aide's allegation that Americans were not only instrumental in toppling him, but they also positioned radical nationalist Mikhail Saakashvilli to take power in Georgia, indicate that external forces played an important role in Georgian events. On the other hand, Georgian nationalists are accusing Russia of fanning separatism in Georgia. Can it be a coincidence that the leaders of three independence-minded Georgian regions, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adjaria, had a meeting in Moscow this past weekend to register their response to the new leaders in Tbilisi? Eduard Kokoity, president of the separatist region of South Ossetia, Raul Khadzhimba, prime minister of separatist region Abkhazia, and Aslan Abashidze, influential and independence-seeking president of the Autonomous Adjarian Republic, have all made it clear, in a unambiguous way that the trio of Saakashvilli, Burjanadze and Zhvania took power in Tbilisi through a coup; they refuse to cooperate with this trio because they lack legitimacy. These kinds of statements indicate polarization in a country where external forces are actively involved in influencing future events and reshaping Georgia's political orientation. FACTS AND FIGURES ON GEORGIA It is important to glance at certain facts about Georgia to better understand the complex situation. The entire Georgian territory is 26,911 sq. mi. The separatist region of Abkhazia has a population of 538,00 and occupies an area of 3,320 sq. mi., along the Black Sea coast, just south of Russia, where the important port of Sukhumi is located. South Ossetia has a population of 100,000; its territorial size is 3,900 sq. mi., located near the Russian-controlled North Ossetia and the trouble separatist region of Chechnya. Adjaria, with a population of 382,000, is located along the Black Sea coast, bordering northeastern Turkey; occupying 1,160 sq. mi., it is a strategically important area, where the important port of Batumi is located. All combined, this constitutes an area of 8,380 sq. mi. with a population of 1,020,000, which is not under the control of the central authorities in Tbilisi. Taking into consideration that Georgians make up only 57.9 percent of the entire population of what is known as the country of Georgia, the rest are Mingrelians (9.1%), Armenians (8.1%), Russians (6.3%), Azerbaijanis (5.7%), Ossetians (3.0%), Greeks (1.9%), Abkhazians (1.8%), and others (6.2%). These numbers are estimated and are variable. Given this situation, it is understandable why this country is extremely vulnerable to external manipulations. The prevailing poverty, unemployment, breakdown in law and order, and rampant corruption, all disillusioned the general population. These factors not only played a role in Shevardnadze's downfall, but they also caused resentment among residents of the separatist-minded regions against the central authorities. RUSSIAN AND AMERICAN OVERTURES Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov already had a closed-door meeting in Mascow with the presidents and prime ministers of these separatist regions, yet they didn't shy away from giving publicity through TV coverage. Russia has already signed visa agreements with the Abkhazians and Ossetians, and is now signing a similar agreement with President of Abkhazia Aslan Abashidze, causing loud protests from the new leaders in Tbilisi. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has reportedly scheduled a trip to Azerbaijan and Georgia this week. All these political activities indicate that a collision of American and Russian national interests is inevitable. The centerpiece of the sources of confrontation is the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline project, which is anticipated to be operational in 2004. Both powers aim to secure geopolitical advantage over each other, to create a new realignment in the region to influence future political events. In the meantime, Russian President Vladimir Putin hastily asked Armenian President Robert Kocharian to come to St. Petersburg on November 30 for a meeting. Unfortunately, Armenia is a frontline country in the middle of these ominous political developments. Sandwiched between hostile Turkey and Azerbaijan, unstable Georgia and the so-called pariah state Iran, Armenia has little room to maneuver. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's pending visit to Azerbaijan and Georgia, while bypassing Armenia, is not a good sign. Washington wishes for Yerevan to kick the Russians out of Armenia, in order to establish control over the entire region. Yet, Armenia, without a military alliance with Russia, is vulnerable to blackmail from Azeris and Turks alike. Mkhail Saakashvilli's rattled Armenian leaders with his recent statement that Georgia and Azerbaijan should cooperate to restore their territorial integrity. According to reports, both Kocharian and Abashidze have a personal dislike of radical nationalist Sakkashvilli, who, in turn, despises both Armenian and Adjarian leaders. According to reports, Saakashvilli is very angry with Kocharian for receiving his arch-enemy Aslan Abashidze in Yerevan. POSITION OF TURKISH LEADERS The position of Turkish leaders in this matter is also very ominous and threatening. Ankara is issuing warnings against Muslim Adjaria and its leader. Aslan Abashidze, not to declare independence from Georgia and back the Christian radical Saakashvilli (similar to Muslim Iranians defending Christian Armenians against Muslim Azeris for political gains). Turks are very concerned that Russians may instigate troubles in Armenian-inhabited Akhalkalaki and independence-minded Adjaria, since these two regions jointly complete the geographical separation of Georgia from Turkey, thus effectively preventing completion of the BTC pipeline project. Taking into consideration the perennial Turkish hostility against Armenians and Russians, Turks are reacting against Abashidze. They are also intensively working to secure the return and resettlement of Meskhetian Turks to Akhalkalaki, who were deported by Stalin during WWII for their disloyalty to the U.S.S.R. The Turks' intention is clear: to neutralize Armenian control over Javakh by diluting its population and to assert Ankara's control over this strategic piece of land. In order to appreciate the upcoming dangers, one has to be familiar with these wild places, strange names and personalities. The main player, Mkhail Saakashvilli, is a 34-year-old, U.S.-educated lawyer, known for his radical, hard-line nationalistic views. He has an unyielding and uncompromising position in Georgia's nationalities issues, and he believes that Georgia belongs to ethnic Georgians alone (close to the nationalistic Turkish mentality). He wants to centralize power and change the autonomous status of Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Adjarias, and make them provinces - an integral part - of Georgia. He has the full support and backing of Turkish leaders who are facing similar separatist demands from their Kurdish population. ABASHIDZE FIGURES IN POWER STRUGGLE The most important figure in the ongoing internal and external power struggle in Georgia is Aslan Abashidze, 65-year-old Russians-educated economist, who became the Chairman of the Adjarian Supreme Council in 1991. He is critical of the new leaders for pursuing virulent nationalism against ethnic minorities and for showing an aggressive and hostile attitude against Russians. He is warning Saakashvilli not to follow the disastrous path of another nationalist-minded leader, the late President of Georgia, Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was overthrown and later murdered. Abashidze is reminding the new leaders in Georgia lost effective control of South Ossetia and, later, Abkhazia. According to his supporters, Abashidze's path is to avoid tragedy by establishing a realistic order and to work on practical solutions to the socioeconomic crisis. He also believes that working with the Russians, rather than working against them, will yield more beneficial results to the Georgian people. He believes that nationalistic forces in Tbilisi, led by Saakashvilli, took power through a coup and, therefore, they lack constitutional legitimacy. He refuses to cooperate with them and makes it very clear that he will work for independence if the new authorities continue to pursue a policy of centralization. He is aware that he is risking confrontation with neighboring Turkey, but he believes that he has backing of Mascow. Abashidze, with Russian encouragement, is coordinating his work with the leaders of the separatist Abkhazians and Ossetians, to establish blueprints of a federative structure in Georgia, where each autonomous region will continue to retain its legislative bodies, presidency and national army, and will have the right to have relations with other states. This is similar to the status, which was once offered to the Azeris, in order to dissolve their disputes with the Karabagh Armenians. Baku rejected this offer. BAD CONDITIONS AND FOREIGN MANIPULATION Post-Shevardnadze Georgia is on the verge of upheaval and territorial disintegration. So far, the opposition has been united against the common enemy, Shevardnadze, Abashidze, Khadzhimba, Kokoity followers and supporters in the regions of Adjaria, Ossetia and Abkhazia. How long will the trio of Saakashvilli, Burjanadze and Zhvania stay together, and how long will it take to restore democracy, to improve the shattered economy? How long will it take to gain the confidence of the other restive ethnic groups in autonomous regions? The answers to these questions depend on how much tolerance the nationalistic forces will have for these minorities. The socioeconomic conditions in Georgia are deteriorating. Georgian workers are demanding unpaid wages for the past six months to feed their families. Georgia's infrastructure is on the verge of collapsing; the foreign debt is 1.6 billion dollars; Georgians are emigrating to Russia to get jobs and make money, and Georgia's population is rapidly declining. As long as the new rulers and opposition leaders of Georgia continue to take instruction from external forces, be it Russia or the U.S. they will never be able to secure Georgia's political and economic stability, national unity and territorial integrity. Georgia's situation may have devastating political and economic repercussions and effects on Armenia. Both the government and opposition of Armenia should realize that their counterparts in Georgia have made the fatal mistake of subjecting themselves to foreign power manipulation in their country. The Armenian government and opposition leaders should work together, not against each other, in order to prevent foreign manipulation and interference, which could have disastrous consequences for the entire Armenian nation.

"Varoujan Martirossian Aghbolaghi, a native of Iran who realized his dream of coming to America and becoming a successful businessman, died of cancer here on November 17, 2003. Varoujan was born in Abadan, Iran on June 10, 1943, to parents Meguerditch & Ishkhanoohi Martirossian. He grew up in Tehran, where he showed his incredibly friendly personality from a young age. Where Armenian kids made friends only with other Armenian kids, he made friends with kids of different religions and nationalities. He couldn't care less if you were Christian, Muslim, Jewish or anything else; all that mattered was that he loved everyone the same, and he remained friends with them for years, many of these friendships continuing until the present. Since the age of seventeen, he had dreamed of coming to the United States, and at a time when coming to the U.S. was only an impossible dream for everyone else, he did absolutely everything in his power to make that dream come true. In 1962, before he reached the age of 18, by sheer willpower, and with a huge grin on his face, he left Iran for the United States. He arrived in his dreamland with empty pockets but a full heart. He did everything to survive without a word of complaint. He once said that, when he was working as a dishwasher in a restaurant, he used to wash pots so big that he had to get in them waste deep to reach the bottom! But his incredible business sense started to rear its ugly head very soon! While shopping in a health food store in the neighborhood, he realized that this might not be a bad idea! By then, his brother Rooben, following in Varoujan's footsteps was in New York and working as a stockbroker. So Varoujan shared his idea with Rooben and Better Nature health-food store was born! And it was a hit. Varoujan then brought his sister to the U.S. in 1973 and, a couple of years later, his parents, thus uniting the family once again. The brothers then opened up the second store and named it Better Nature Too. In 1981, while the family was in the process of opening the third health food store, he met his beautiful bride to be, Ankineh Chilingarian; after a five-month whirlwind romance, they were married. Varoujan loved his life. Everything he did, he did it with perfection in mind and love at heart. He loved his parents, he loved hid wife, he loved his throng of friends, and he loved life in general. But the biggest love of his life was yet to come. And he arrived on June 25, 1992. His name was Shahant. Varoujan's sun rose and set with Shahant. Absolutely everything he did was for Shahant and his future. He adored Shahant with all his heart and soul and couldn't stop talking about him, and bragging how smart he was. In 1981 he converted the health food store into a successful restaurant, Peter's, and soon after he opened a second restaurant in Del Ray Beach, Florid. Everything seemed absolutely prefect, but unfortunately life had other plans for Varoujan. His health started to deteriorate in his mid-fifties, but Varoujan, the picture of strength, refused to accept that he should take it slower. No matter how much his wife and his parents urged him to take care of himself and not work so hard, traveling back and forth between New York and Del Ray, he was just to busy living life to worry about minor problems, as he called them. However, his zest for life was unable to battle his failing health. Earlier this year, he was told that he might have cancer. In November, while trying to sell his restaurant in Del Ray Beach, he developed internal bleeding, which caused him to be hospitalized. After he was transferred to New York, he succumbed on Monday evening, November 17, 2003 to the dreaded disease, and the world lost a beautiful human being. Varoujan was entombed at George Washington Memorial Cemetery, Paramus, New Jersey after church services held at St. Illuminator's Armenian Apostolic Cathedral in New York City.

"At an international conference jointly organized by several Argentinean universities that took place at the University of Buenos Aires, Professor Vahakn N. Dadrian of the Zoryan Institute delivered an address on The Comparative Aspects of the Armenian Genocide and the Jewish Holocaust: Similarities and Dissimilarities. In differentiating these two principal genocides of the twentieth century from each other, he pointed out some of the most salient features of the Armenian case. Among them were the following: (a) the Armenians were destroyed in their ancestral territories, thus compounding the huge loss of human beings with the loss of territories of millennial heritage; (b) there was massive popular participation in this process of destruction; (c) unlike in the case of the Holocaust, where extermination was mostly carried out mechanically, in the Armenian Genocide blunt instruments, including swords, daggers, axes, cudgels, etc., were employed to kill the victims by mutilation; (d) religion was exploited to enlist Muslim masses in the carnage by declaring jihad (holy war); (e) unlike in the case of the perpetrators of the Holocaust, whose heirs recognized and tried to atone for the colossal crime, the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide and their heirs persist in denial. The university provided simultaneous translation. Among the attendees of this session of the conference were university faculty, and the director of the Argentine government's Human Rights Department. The organizers of the conference informed Dr. Dadrian that, in addition to his monograph on this topic that came out in Spanish two years ago, they have now completed the Spanish translation of a second of his major published studies of the Armenian Genocide, due to appear shortly. The reference is to his legal analysis of the Armenian Genocide that appeared in the Yale Journal of International Law. Moreover, his latest work on Children as Victims of Genocide: the Armenian Case, is likewise scheduled for translation and publication in Buenos Aires. Prof. Dadrian's second lecture was at the University of Corientes. His topic was The Historical Antecedents of the World War I Armenian Genocide. The university had invited several community leaders and other professionals, many of whom were from the medical profession, who posed a number of questions with respect to the level of German involvement in the Armenian Genocide. At the end, the Rector of the University presented Dr. Dadrian a formal certificate on behalf of the Minister of Culture and Education of Argentina. His final lecture was in Armenian, delivered before the Armenian community of Buenos Aires at the Armenian Center. Dr. Dadrian also held a seminar for the benefit of Armenian teachers associated with a number of Armenian schools in the Argentine capital. His theme was: how to acquaint young Armenian pupils and students with the great tragedy of the Armenian Genocide. In addition, he gave a press conference to the representatives of Armenian- and Spanish-language media of Buenos Aires, and briefly participated in the Armenian Fund Phone-a-thon, that coincided with his stay in that city, by urging the Armenians to support, to the extent of their ability, the North-South Artsakh highway project, emphasizing its vital strategic and economic importance. On the last day of his week's sojourn in Argentina, Dr. Dadrian, along with Professor Henry Huttenbach, professor at City College of New York, and editor of the Journal of Genocide Research, was interviewed by one of the editors of the Buenos Aires Herald, the city's only English-language newspaper. The subject of the interview was his lecture at the Conference, which Dr. Dadrian recounted at length, underscoring the similarities and dissimilarities of the Armenian and Jewish cases of genocide. The paper devoted almost an entire page to this presentation, along with his and Huttenbach's photos. There is every indication that the Armenian Genocide is increasingly becoming a subject engaging the attention of Argentinean historians and social scientists. Currently there is in circulation in Argentina, in addition to the journal articles cited above, a book that the Zoryan Institute published two years ago under the title Key Elements of Turkish Denial of the Armenian Genocide by Vahakn Dadrian, that was translated into Spanish and then published in Buenos Aires through the special efforts there of an Armenian industrialist, George Vartparonian. In addition, there are a number of scholars there, who are researching and publishing in Spanish on Armenian history, the Armenian community in Argentina, and the Armenian Genocide.

"Clark's Key Irish Advisor GENERAL Wesley Clark was in Manhattan last Thursday night at a fundraiser in the West Village hosted by socialite and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg. In the course of the evening, during the question and answer period, Clark was asked who his major advisors were. He responded with a list drawn heavily from the Clinton White House, heavily sprinkled with Jewish, Black and Latino names. Then he paused at the end and said, But my most important advisor is my brother-in-law, an Irish Catholic from Brooklyn. Clark is married to Irish American Gertie Kingston from New York, and it was her brother he was referring to. Clark's mixture of supporters from different backgrounds suits him. Here, after all, is a man who was born Jewish, though he never really knew his father, raised Protestant, converted to his wife's Catholicism, and now, it has been revealed, attends Methodist church after an anti-war priest deeply offended him during a July 4 service. All we need now is for him to become a Muslim, said one party-goer, and he'll hit every voting block. Clark's Irish American links might help balance off the fact that he became a Knight Commander of the British Empire (honorary) on March 28, 2000 after his heroics during the Serbia campaign. As a former Rhodes Scholar, Clark is well attuned to the British sensibility on issues, so it will be interesting to see what his Irish positions are. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"CONSTANTINOPLE - A series of suicide bombings, one against two Jewish synagogues and another against the British Consulate and a British bank, killed scores of people and injured hundreds, wreaking havoc in the heart of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), the largest and most cosmopolitan city in Turkey. In the latest attack, two vans packed with explosives exploded almost simultaneously at 11:10 AM local time (4:10 AM EST) on November 20, outside the United Kingdom's General Consulate, as well as outside the main branch of HSBC in Turkey. HSBC, a London-based colossus, is the second largest bank in assets worldwide. At press time, 31 people were reported killed, and more than 460 were injured in the ensuing carnage. Among the dead were UK Consul General Roger Short, as well as other British employees of the British Consulate and HCBC. Three Greek nationals were also injured, according to Greek media reports. The attacks led to the partial collapse of both buildings, creating a tragic and maccabre picture of dead bodies and twisted metal spread in the debris. The horrendous photos, flashed on television screens across the world, further tarnished the image of Turkey, raising concern about its stability. Great Britain, Many countries, to include the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Spain and Japan, issued travel advisories, warning their citizens that travel to Turkey should be avoided at this time and until further notice. SYNAGOGUE BOMBINGS The latest attacks came on the heels of the double bombing on Saturday, November 15 against two Jewish synagogues. The Sabbath services at Beth Israel, the city's main synagogue, and Neve Shalom, a historic Sephardic temple, were interrupted by two huge explosions set by suicide bombers. A total of 25 people (only six of whom were Jewish) were killed, and 302 were injured. Turkish authorities believe both sets of the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers linked to the al Quaeda terrorist network. The Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front, a Turkish extremist Islamic group which maintains links with al-Quaeda, claimed responsibility for the bloody incidents. On November 21, the Turkish Government announced that a number of suspects were arrested (seven, according to Turkish media reports). At press time, the suspects were being held for questioning, but no charges had yet been filed. The international reaction was strong and swift. The United States, Britain, Russia, France and other countries, including neighboring Greece, Israel and Egypt, condemned the terrorist attacks and expressed sympathy for the families of the victims. President Bush, who was visiting London on an official state visit to the UK, and British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the terrorists have shown utter disregard for human life and reiterated their steadfast determination continue the fight against terrorism worldwide. LIKE A FIST Britsh Foregin Minister Jack Straw, who went to Constantinople right after the attacks against the British targets occurred to evaluate the situation, issued a strong joint statement with Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, who cut short his own visit to Sweden, that both nations stand united like a fist in their common fight against terrorism. Mr. Straw also warned, however, that more terrorist attacks could still take place in Turkey. Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece sent a message of condolences to his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayip Erdogan and publicly condemned blind violence that leads to death and destruction. His All Holliness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople also condemned the attacks. The Ecumenical Patriarch has personally attended funeral services for Jewish victims of the synagogue bombings. Attacks on Jews and Jewish targets in Turkey were rare, as the Turkish secular leadership established under Mustafa Kemal Attaturk - the founder of the modern Turkish state - and his successors has tried to make a point of showcasing peaceful co-existance of Muslims and Jews in the Turkish Republic. But the recent terrorist attacks have manifested, however, that Turkey gets the unlucky distinction of becoming a frontline in the war on terrorism, like Germany was the frontline of the East-West conflict, for much of the Cold War period, as noted by Stephen Handelman in a recent news analysis published in the Toronto Star. Coupled with the most severe economic crisis since the end of World War II in 1945 (combining galloping inflation, rising unemployment and a mounting national debt), the terrorist attacks have virtually shattered the image of Turkey as stable democratic country, a secular state with a Muslim population and western values touted by Washington and London and promoted by the moderate Islamist government of Mr. Erdogan, as well as his nationalist predecessors. Further complicating matters are the rising tensions between the Erdogan government on the one hand and the Kemalist establishment on the other (represented by President Ahmed Cezer and Turkey's powerful military, which remains influential, even though its power has been curbed by cuts in its budget and a constitutional amendment demanded by the European Union). PRETEXT According to Dr. Arianna Ferentinou, a professor of International Studies at Bilgi University in Istanbul and a correspondent for ERT (National Greek Radio and TV Network), the Kemalist establishment and Turkish military are already using the terrorist attacks as a pretext to slow down attempted reforms of the Erdogan government, and to restrict recently enacted freedoms for the Turkish populace. At this time, the EU is not satisfied with Turkish attempts to adapt to European norms and procedures prior to December 2004, when the EU leadership is set discuss Turkey's application for membership. The US, up to recently a staunch supporter of Turkey, has also tempered its countenance considerably after the repeated flip-flops of Ankara's position on the war in Iraq and its reluctance to send peace-keeping forces there. Turkey's final decision not to join the US-led coalition in Iraq was made by the Erdogan government in early November after fierce opposition was voiced by the Iraqis. Not only the Kurdish representatives, but all 24 members of the Iraq Governing Council (the American hand-picked Provisional Government) vehemently objected to the presence of military forces in Iraq from any neighboring country. Many political observers in Baghdad noted that lingering Iraqi mistrust of the Turks dates back to Ottoman colonial rule. Article copyright Hellenic Times.

"IF I had the time back I wouldn't have kidnapped my son, but then, it was all I could do at the time, says Maura White, 42. Sitting in a friend's kitchen in Queens, White's face reddens as she recalls abducting her son and stealing him out of the U.S. three years ago. Really there was nothing else I could have done. I took my son away from a man who had an anger problem to protect my baby, she says. But once an American-born child is taken out of the country without the consent of both parents, the case is deemed a kidnapping and the penalty is prison. In 1988 The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction, authorized a pact among dozens of nations that states children should stay in their habitual residence until they reach 16, unless they face grave danger. If one parent takes a child under 16 out of the U.S. that parent can be charged with abduction and can face prison. At the very least, that parent must return to the U.S. to face a hearing on custody of the child. I knew, you know, that I shouldn't be taking me son because I knew about that law, but he was in danger, says White. IN 1990 Maura White came to New York from a town near Co. Kilkenny. After a few years of working and having fun, Maura was introduced to Muhammad, a Moroccan Muslim who hadn't practiced his faith in a while. I know that the Muslim religion forbids smoking and drinking, but when I met him, he smoked, he drank and he was great fun, recalled White. Her friends warned her that the Irish Catholic and Moroccan Muslim religions were very different and she should gain a better understanding of each religion before she got too involved. But she didn't listen. She was happy to be falling in love with a man who was handsome, charming and very thoughtful. He was lovely, so charming, she smiles. But as White recalls that first blossom of love, her face changes. Glancing at the table where a picture of her brown-eyed son stares out, she grimaces. So we got married in City Hall. Neither of us was into religion and it wasn't an issue. We moved in together in the Bronx and we were really happy, White remembers. Then he began to feel guilty about not practicing his religion and he gave up drinking and smoking, practiced Ramadan (Muslim religious fasting) and became very strict with me, asking where I was going. Then I got pregnant. He said he wanted me to have an abortion. But White defied Muhammad and continued her pregnancy. That's when it started. First it was just shouting at me. He called me fat, sick, asked me to do things for him. I couldn't; I was sick for the whole pregnancy. Just unlucky I guess. When the abuse got really bad, Muhammad would speak in Arabic to his family, who were a constant presence in the marital home. Then he began to get really angry. He would insult me in Arabic and tell me he was doing it. I had to eat upstairs away from them. Then he hit me. I knew I was in trouble then. But she stayed. She's not sure exactly why. There was nowhere for her to turn. She was too frightened to burden her family in New York, her friends. So she hid her miserable life and she had her baby five years ago, whom she has asked the Irish Voice not to name. Then he began shouting at the baby, really for no reason. And I didn't know what to do. I knew it would be wrong to take him, she explains. But one night in 2000, while her husband slept in their bed, she planned to leave and couldn't sleep with fear. Once he got up and headed to work in his job in marketing, White climbed out of bed, got dressed, dressed her son and walked out the door. Fortunately, her baby, barely crawling, didn't understand what was going on. I went to my friend's house and I told what had happened to me and we drove to the airport, said White, who had secretly booked passage on an Aer Lingus flight. She was going home. BUT the journey to the airport was excruciating. White constantly watched out the windows, afraid that one of Muhammad's family had seen her escape. In the airport at the desk I just kept saying, `Get me out of here,' she smiles. Glancing around her in case someone heard, she says she never thought she would be safe until she landed in Ireland. Even then, she knew it was only a matter of time. Once she had returned to her hometown, her first instinct was to change her name and her son's name. But because both parents' consent is needed for that, she was having difficulty in getting it done. Then one morning, towards the end of 2000, she opened the door to a man asking her name. Wary of the stranger, she pretended to be someone else. But he served her with a summons to appear in the Irish High Court in Dublin on child abduction charges. It had been so long I thought he had forgotten me, she admitted. The following week she was told by the High Court that under the Hague Convention, she had kidnapped her son and she was looking at three years in prison if she didn't bring the child back to America immediately. She agreed to go back. She had no other choice. But people told me, `Run Maura, run with the boy, they won't ever find you.' But they always find you so I agreed to go back, she said. Once back in the U.S. White was miserable. She was forced to hand over her son to meet his father and face a court system she wasn't sure was in her favor. Just last month, the final decision was made. Muhammad takes his son every weekend for a visit, but White has him the rest of the time. My son can never leave the New York area, he can never leave the United States. Sometimes I worry my husband will take him to Morocco and raise him Muslim, but I can't worry about that, she says. For the next 11 years, White cannot bring her son on a day trip to New Jersey or a vacation to Florida. If she wants to go anywhere with him, she has to get court and her ex-husband's approval. But she has resigned herself to that. It was hard in the beginning, when the court ordered me back and it was like starting all over again, but I'm getting used to it now, my son is getting used to it, she says. But if she had the time back, she would never have put her son through the ordeal. She wishes she had listened to the warning. I sometimes wish I had given birth in Ireland, or I had been able to just move to another apartment and work things out with Muhammad there. But at the time, there was nothing else I could have done. I had to take my son to protect him. Thank God it all turned out okay though. At five, her son is now asking questions. He wants to know why, unlike other parents, his mom and dad live apart. On Sunday nights, after Maura picks her son up from the drop off point at the local police station, she hears her son talk about how his daddy doesn't eat meat. In the summer time, her gorgeous little boy looks a lot like his dad. He is getting darker all the time. Eventually her son will wonder what happened to make his mother look at him so full of regret sometimes. IN a similar case last week Cara Gunn from Northern Ireland entered court in Florida for the first time to fight for the custody of her son Dylan. She had just been ordered back from Northern Ireland under the Hague Convention of International Child Abduction. Robert Gunn, 30, from Florida filed for divorce in 2002, after his wife returned to her native Northern Ireland with their son and her daughter from a previous relationship. Gunn was given residential custody of the boy who was born in Northern Ireland. Cara, 29, claimed she took her son in August 2002 to protect him. She met Gunn in Spain in 1995, while he was in the U.S. Navy, and she on holiday. They married in 1997. Dylan was born on April 10, 1998. After Gunn shouted and attacked her once too often, she says, she took her son and fled America where the family had been living. Cara will probably be in and out of court for years. The American justice system takes its time, it's the worst part of it. These last few years have been the worst in my life, says White as she leaves to collect her son from school. At least my son is happy now, she smiles. Article copyright Irish Tribune.","Brennan, Georgina",Irish Voice,2003-11-25,1
"Osmanlinin Kanli Tarihi (The Bloody History of the Ottomans). By Ismail Metin. Istanbul, Ant Yayinlari, 1996, 447 pp. Chapter five is tilted Torture and Insults to Self-Esteem. Metin states that the Ottoman government inflicted unimaginable means of torture as a form of punishment. For example, if a man eloped with a girl with the intention of marrying her, his genitalia were radically amputated (ref. Siyasi Kulturumuzde Zulum ve Iskence [Cruelty and Torture in Our Political Culture] by Taner Akcam, p. 35). Other forms of painful punishments were amputation of ear lobes and the nose (ref. A. Lamartine, History of the Ottomans, 2:507); gouging of both eyes; blinding the eyes by pouring boiling vinegar on them; or burning with red-hot iron bars or by hot wax (ref. Lord Kinross, Osmanli Tarihi, p. 65; Joseph V. Hammer, Osmanli Tarihi, 1:36; Akcam, op. cit., p. 285; Prof. Ahmed Mumcu, Osmanli Devletinde Siyasetten Katl [Political Murder in the Ottoman Government], p. 87). Metin also states those condemned to death were often tortured by gouging the eyes, immersing the person in ice water during the winter, binding them on a cross, pulling out the nails, flaying the skin with a razor, putting a red-hot metal crown on the head, burning various parts of the body with hot iron, injuring various organs by screws, breaking bones of arms and legs with a hammer etc. (Ref, Akcam, op. cit., p.72) PRINCIPLE OF KILLING PEOPLE The sixth chapter deals with the Principle of Killing People. Ottoman sultans followed the principle that governing the people gently would spoil them, and that the common people understood only the rule of the sword. (Ref. Prof. Ahmed Mumcu, op. cit. p. 142). A certain Kuyucu Murat Pasha used to throw people into water wells. When he was asked why he killed people in this way, he replied, What shall I do, the government can only control and govern by force. (The Turkish word kuyucu means one who digs wells; thus was derived the nickname of Murat Pasha - S.K.). The sultan or the prime minister could give the death penalty to any citizen. The latter could be condemned to death for very trivial reasons. Executioners were always ready, both in the sultan's palace and in the cities. Executioners used to travel with the sultan, whenever he traveled or went to war. The way a condemned person was killed depended on his or her rank; soldiers or high-ranking officials were killed by suffocation, in order not to spill their blood. Commoners were either hanged or decapitated in public. When the decapitated person had a high rank, his head was presented to the sultan on a silver plate. The decapitated heads used to be exposed to the public for three days in front of government buildings. The reason why the sultan wanted to see the decapitated heads of government officials was to make sure that the individual was killed. The best-known case of a decapitated high-ranking official was Midhat Pasha, the earliest reformer of Turkey. He was the author of the Ottoman Constitution of 1876. He tried to restore the Ottoman Parliament that was dissolved by Abdulhamid II, but was tried and convicted in 1881 and then exiled to the citadel of Taef in Arabia. He was murdered in 1884 in the citadel by agents of the sultan and his head was sent to Sultan Abdulhamid for verification. REASONS FOR, AND METHODS OF, PUNISHING Chapters 6 to 18 describe in detail reasons for, and methods of, punishing persons. On page 260, Metin discusses murdering a person by impaling. He states that impaling was one of the most atrocious methods of killing and was used very often by the Ottoman government to punish criminals or subjects who had revolved. In 1814, there was a revolt in Serbia, and 300 Serbs were killed by impaling (Taner Akcam, op. cit., p.138). Impaling was done by introducing a vertically positioned wooden or metal stake through the rectum and forcing it upwards towards the abdomen and chest until the person expired. The public was forced by the government to witness this most brutal way of punishment. (The interested reader may read a description of impaling on pp. 46-7 of the novel The Bridge on the Drina by the Nobel Prize-winning Yugoslav writer Ivo Andric.) Chapter 19 discusses the so-called Law of Fratricide, the barbaric way of solving the problem of succession in the Ottoman dynasty after the death of a sultan. Succession problems have always occurred in countries ruled by autocratic rulers, often by the murder of a member of the ruling family by the king or emperor. The Ottoman ruling family and dynasty lasted about 600 years, which is twice as long as the rule of the German Hohenzollern family or the Hapsburgs of Austria, and one-third longer than that of the Romanovs of the Russian Empire. The reason for the six centuries of uninterrupted rule of the Ottoman dynasty was due to the merciless murder of all the male members of the new sultan's family by the order of the sultan himself. In fact, the founder of the Ottoman dynasty, Osman Ghazi, killed his paternal uncle Dundar Bey, due to some disagreement, by his own hands in 1298. (Metin, p.283). Metin comments that As soon as the Ottoman government was established, murder of members of the ruling family started. Thus from the beginning, this murder showed that the Ottoman government would be swimming in a lake of blood. FRATRICIDE, OTTOMAN STYLE Following the death of Osman Ghazi, his eldest son Orhan became sultan from 1324 to 1360. Following his death, his eldest son was supposed to become sultan. However, his younger brother, Murat I, was somehow elected. Halil and the youngest brother, Ibrahim, objected to this irregularity, and Murat did not hesitate to kill his two brothers. Moreover, Murat also murdered his own son, Savci Bey. The reason given was that Savci Bey revolted against his father. This practice of killing brothers by the ruling sultan continued with every Sultan. As soon as Mehmet II, called Fatih, the conqueror of Constantinople, became sultan, he killed his newborn brother Ahmed in 1451, as well as a second brother Orhan. Metin comments, Killing your newborn brother by suffocating him is an act of savagery not seen any time anywhere in the world (p.296). Later on, Sultan Mehmet II enacted this detestable practice into law, as seen in his imperial edict and known as the Law of Fratricide. This law states: And to whomsoever of my sons the Sultanate shall pass, it is fitting that for the order of the World he shall kill his brothers. Most of the ulema (religious leaders - S.K.) allow it. So let them act on this. The logic justifying this law was that it is preferable that the royal family lose a member or members by execution rather than a province be lost over quarrels among the heirs after the death of a sultan. Metin gives the Turkish version of this law, quoting Dr. Ahmed Mumcu, Osmanli Devletinde Siyasi Katil, p. 193. The English version is given by Gibb and Bowen, Islamic Society and the West, vol. 1, p. 36. It is also given by A.D. Alderson, The Structure of the Ottoman Dynasty, p. 167. I would like to make two comments about the Law of Fratricide: 1. The killing of family members by the sultan was not limited to the males or just his brothers. To quote Dr. Mehmet Akman, Osmanli Devrinde Kardes Katli (Fratricide During the Ottoman Period, Eren Publication, Istanbul, 1997, p. 15): the term Fratricide includes cases of a father killing his son, a brother killing his brother and his brothers' children, and their uncles, a son killing his father and even a grandfather killing his grandsons. It even included the new sultan's killing of pregnant concubines of his dead father, to rule out any possibility of a male offspring in the future. MORE ON FRATRICIDE It seems this awful practice of fratricide even reached the ears of Shakespeare, who mentions it in The Second Part of the History of Henry IV, Act V, Scene 2, referring to Sultan Murad III as Amurath (British historians often call Murad Amurath - S.K.), when he has the newly crowned Henry V greet his younger brothers thus: Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear: This is the English, not the Turkish court, Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds, But Harry Harry! Yet be sad good brothers, For by my faith, it very well becomes you... Of course, Shakespeare was trying to demonstrate that succession in an English royal family, unlike in Ottoman dynasties, took place without murder. My second comment about fratricide. The edict of fratricide given above states that most of the ulema (religious leaders) allow it. This shows that at least some of the religious leaders would not endorse such a law. Here I should mention that neither the Moslem holy book, the Koran, nor traditional Islamic laws mention anything to justify a law like fratricide. It has not been practiced in any Muslim country, except the Ottoman Empire. Sultan Mehmet II exploited his position as Caliph to influence the Muslim religion and its religious leaders to give some sort of apparent legitimacy to the law of fratricide. Metin also comments as follows about Sultan Suleyman, also called the Magnificent. The Turkish Republic established by Ataturk has organized festivals in the United States celebrating the life of Suleyman the Magnificent, whose savagery broke all records in Ottoman history. Suleyman the Magnificent murdered his nephew, his two sons and seven grandsons, so no one would challenge his authority or throne. EVEN WORSE RULERS But there followed even worse rulers. Sultan Mehmed III, who ruled from 1595 to 1603, murdered his nineteen brothers, the oldest being 12 years old, and his son as soon as he became sultan. Metin also mentions that whenever a new sultan ascended the throne, not only did a general massacre of males in the imperial family take place, but also all pregnant concubines were put in bags and thrown into the sea. The bags were weighted with heavy stones, to make sure that no one escaped (Metin, p. 289). The practice of fratricide lasted until 1757. After this date, the brothers of the new sultan were imprisoned in isolated rooms, called kafes, or cage. Chapter 23 is titled The Massacres of Alevis. The great majority of Ottoman Turks belong to the Sunni branch of Islam. The Shiites, or the Alevis as the Turks called them, have been a minority. There has never been any census of Alevis in Turkey, either in the Ottoman or the Republican period. It has been estimated that Alevis constitute as little as 7% and as much as 30% of Turkey's population. On page 345 of his aforementioned book, Metin writes that the Ottomans performed their greatest massacres by killing the Alevis. He states that the Ottoman government, under the influence of religious leaders, was fanatically Sunni, and as a result could not tolerate the beliefs of the Alevis. Thus they considered Alevis as their greatest enemies, forcing the latter to rebel from time to time. On one occasion, 3,000 Alevis were massacred near Sivas (Baki Oz, Osmanli'da Alevi Ayaklanmalari [Alevi Rebellions under the Ottomans], p. 125). On another occasion, Kuyucu Murat Pasa sent 30,000 decapitated heads of Alevis to Istanbul and killed another 100,000 Alevis by throwing them into wells. Later he was imprisoned for stealing some of the booty that he had taken from the Alevis (Metin, p. 349). The conqueror of Istanbul, Mehmet II, took 3,000 Turkmen Alevis when he went for one of his battles. He was afraid that the Turkmens would rebel in his absence, so he took them to the battlefield and killed 400 every day, thus eliminating them in a short time (Taner Akcam, Siyasi Kulturumuzde Zulum ve Iskence, p. 90). Sultan Selim I, also called Yavuz (stern or tough), after eliminating his rival brothers one by one, imprisoned and executed 40,000 Alevis in 1514, because they were heretic Shiites. (Metin, p. 351; Halil Inalcik, op.cit., p. 33). The last chapter gives examples of insults or punishments to which non-Muslims were subjected. Christmas or Jews could not paint their houses white, could not wear fancy clothing or green shoes. Often they were condemned to death for these prohibited acts (Taner Akcam, op. cit., p. 58). As I mentioned above, Metin does not mention at all the massacres of Armenians committed by the Ottoman government during the 19th century and the Genocide during the twentieth century. I am sure he knows very well about these. My guess is that Metin knows what Turkish democracy is and that he could not have published his book if he had included the Armenian massacres.

"WARSAW -- There probably aren't too many Poles or Polonians now at least in their mid-30s who do not remember where they were and what they were doing when they first heard that a Pole had been elected to the papacy. I was teaching college, high school and adult-education Polish in Bay City, Michigan and vicinity when I first heard the news. An elderly Polish American school-crossing guard at St Stanislaus Kostka school asked me: Did you hear that Cardinal Wyszynski was elected pope? Some people even thought another of those stupid Pollack jokes was coming when they first heard on the radio things like We now have a Polish pope! But it soon turned out it was not Cardinal Wyszynski and it was definitely not a joke. On October 16, 1978, Karol Cardinal Wojtyla, the Archbishop of Krakow, had become the first non-Italian pontiff in more than four-and-a-half centuries. The announcement Habemus papam (We have a pope) and the appearance of the Polish-born prelate on a balcony overlooking St. Peter's square was beamed by satellite to millions of people around the globe. Jubilation swept Poland and Polonia--church-bells rang, masses of thanksgiving were celebrated and trips to Rome were planned. As a founding member of the Saginaw Valley Friends of Polish Culture, I received numerous local requests for frameable pictures of John Paul II, whose appearance was not yet widely known among Polonia, and Father Wladyslaw Gowin of the Society of Christ graciously helped me out. Celebrations are again taking place 25 years later. Anniversary masses, commemorative exhibitions, TV specials and other events are highlighting the achievements and experiences of one of Christendom's longest-serving pope. Rather than the wonder, surprise and hope of a quarter-century ago, it is a time to look back over the major milestones of a truly unique pontificate, whose wide-ranging implications have had an impact not only for the world's more than one billion Roman Catholics. BORN IN THE SOUTHERN TOWN of Wadowice in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains on May 18th, 1920, Karol Wojtyla lost his mother, Emilia, nee Kaczorowska, when he was nine years old. The product of a devoutly Catholic home, in his youth Lolek (as he was known by family and friends) served as an altar boy and belonged to a Marian Sodality and the Association of Catholic Youth (Stowarzyszenie Mlodziezy Katolickiej). By the age of 21, he was the only living member of his immediate family. His elder brother and only sibling, a medical doctor, died of a contagious disease in 1932 and his father went on to his reward in 1940. Among the hallmarks of his dynamic pontificate have been numerous firsts and superlatives--a tendency that revealed itself much earlier in earlier career. He was undoubtedly the first pope ever to have worked in a stone quarry and chemical plant, act in underground theater plays and study for the priesthood at a clandestine seminary due to the restrictions of Nazi occupation period. In 1958, Rev. Karol Wojtyla was appointed auxiliary bishop of Krakow by Pope Pius XII and became the youngest member of the Polish Episcopate. He became archbishop in 1963 and in 1967 Pope Paul VI made him the youngest member of the College of Cardinals. A sports-loving outdoorsman, the young Father Wojtyla would take his students on canoe and camping trips as well as hikes through the mountains. He enjoyed skiing and continued to pursue the sport in the Italian Alps during the early years of his pontificate. He endeared himself to the people of the Krakow area by fighting for a church in the industrial suburb of Nowa Huta, which Poland's Soviet-backed regime had wanted to be a godless communist showcase. John Paul II is undoubtedly the most widely-traveled pope in history, having made some 100 foreign pilgrimages to all the world's inhabited continents. And no other pope in history was known to speak as many languages as the Polish-born Supreme Pontiff. In addition to his native tongue and ecclesiastical Latin, he is fluent in Italian, French, Spanish, German, English and Russian, which he has occasion to use on a nearly daily basis, and has a working knowledge of a dozen other languages as well. He is able to read and pronounce many more foreign tongues from texts written in phonetic transcription. But he writes all his encyclicals in his native Polish and has them translated into Italian and other languages. WHATEVER ELSE MAY BE SAID of the Holy Father, he seems likely to go down in history as the pope of ecumenism and peace. No other Roman Catholic leader has come close in bringing people of diverse religions, cultures and ethnic backgrounds together. John Paul II was the first pope to enter a Jewish synagogue, pray at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, one of Judaism's most sacred sites, and visit a Muslim mosque. He annulled the excommunication of Martin Luther and hosted common prayer meetings with representatives of all the world's major religions, including Buddhists, Hindus, Shintoists and Animists. In the 1980s, the pope also inspired a reconciliation process between the Roman Catholic Church and Polonia's own Polish National Catholic Church. The dialogue led to the wiping-out of the excommunication of PNCC organizer Bishop Franciszek Hodur and reaffirmed the validity of sacraments dispensed by the Kosciol Narodowy. As a result, the Polish National Catholic Holy Orders of several priests accepted into the RC Church were acknowledged as valid, and unlike Anglican clergy converting to Roman Catholicism, they did not have to be re-ordained. The Holy Father's greatest unfulfilled hope is his desire to make a pilgrimage to Russia and seek reconciliation with that country's Eastern Orthodox Church. He has visited various Orthodox countries, but Russia's Eastern Orthodox leaders strongly oppose such a visit, fearful of losing some of its followers to Catholicism. The Polish-born pontiff has always been an internationally-acknowledged force for peace in all world trouble spots, but has never openly sided with any of the warring parties. All his pronouncements on the subject reflect the pain he experiences at the thought of innocent casualties, the dead, wounded, orphaned children and general destruction of people's lifelong accomplishments. Although an ardent opponent of totalitarian communism, he nevertheless refused to publicly bless capitalism and has always called on the rich and powerful to share their abundance with those less fortunate. The pope helped to inspire Polish workers when on his first papal visit to his homeland in 1979 he invoked the Holy Spirit to descend and renew this land. One year later, Solidarnosc, the Soviet bloc's first independent union emerged amid widespread labor unrest and ultimately led in 1989 to the collapse of the Soviet Empire. But during successive visits to his native land, the former Krakow archbishop warned his compatriots against the civilization of death, his code-name for the empty, shallow and shortsighted, ideology of godless, pleasure-seeking materialism poisoning much of today's modern world. John Paul's deteriorating health has fueled periodic speculations that he might soon step down. He is able to painfully walk only very short distances, his speech is often slurred and Parkinson's disease causes his left hand to tremble. But the Polish-born pope seems to attach little importance to his own convenience and well-being and ignores personal discomfort and pain. I know exactly how long I will remain pope -- as long as God lets me, is the way he has replied to such queries. Vatican insiders describe him as a man of frail physical health but with a keen intellect and a heart full of ardent love for God and mankind. He can truly be referred to as Poland's greatest gift to today's selfish, confused and troubled world. Article copyright Polish American Journal.

"Chris Bohjalian, Micheline Aharonian Marcom, Viken Berberian. These are acclaimed Armenian-American writers who will be honored as winners of the coveted Anahid Literary Award by The Armenian Center at Columbia University on Friday, November 7, 2003, at 7 p.m. The moderator will be well-known novelist Nancy Kricorian, the winner of this award in 1998. This special event will take place at the Julius Held Auditorium, Room 304, Barnard College, 117th Street and Broadway. BEST SELLER TO FILM Chris Bohjalian, winner of the 1999 Anahid Literary Award, is the author of eight novels which together have been published in eleven languages, in sixteen countries. Two of these works, Mid-wives (1997), and The Law of Similars (1999), both published by Harmony Books/Random House, Inc., became national bestsellers, with Midwives capturing #1 on The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Publishers Weekly, and USA Today bestseller lists. His latest book, The Buffalo Soldier, was published in 2002. In addition, Midwives became a Columbia-Tristar movie starring Sissy Spacek, and Bohjalian's 1992 novel. Past the Bleachers, was produced by Hallmark pictures, first airing in June 1995, with Richard Dean Anderson in the leading role. Chris Bohjalian, who graduated Summa Cum Laude from Amherst College, with membership in the national honor society, Phi Beta Kappa, is the author of more than 50 magazine articles and essays. He has been published in Cosmopolitan, Reader's Digest, the Boston Globe Sunday Magazine, and Ararat, among others. Since 1992, he has been a weekly Sunday living section columnist for Gannett's Burlington Free Press. He currently lives in Vermont. RAVE REVIEWS The 2001 Anahid Literary Award recipient, Micheline Aharonian Marcom, is the author of Three Apples Fell From Heaven, which not only garnered rave reviews in The New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, The Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, among others, but had a paperback edition printed in 2002. This work, which was gleaned from her maternal grandmother's life, a survivor of the 1915 Genocide, was the runner-up for the Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for First Fiction. The catalyst for this novel was her bitter memory from a dinner attended by Marcom at which a Turkish friend erupted in anger when she mentioned the Armenian Genocide. She decided to research the history of the Genocide and write her first novel which is not presented chronologically, suggesting that just as there is no real beginning to cruelty and oppression, there is no ending. Marcom, who was born in Saudi Arabia and raised in Los Angeles, currently resides in northern California. POLITICAL VIOLENCE WITH GOURMET TWIST The Cyclist takes political violence to a new level. This book by 2002 Anahid Literary Award winner Viken Berberian, and published by Simon and Schuster, presents a nuanced view of a terrorist who, on the side, loves good food. Portraying the protagonist empathetically, especially after September 11, was a risky adventure for the author who felt that there's no shortage of pundits recasting themselves as terrorist experts. He thought it would be interesting to slip inside the head of a man in the business of terror and present a view from the outsider perspective. Berberian's interest in the subject started when his father was shot in Lebanon in a politically motivated killing. His research took him to the Nairobi trial of the U.S. Embassy bombing suspects, as well as to Lebanon where he was born, and to an Upper Galilee village in Israel where Jewish, Arab (both Christian and Muslim) and Druse families all coexisted peacefully. Berberian, who was raised in Beirut and Los Angeles, is a graduate of Columbia University, and is doing research in Marseilles, France, for an upcoming book. WRITER, POET, LECTURER Nancy Kricorian, 1998 Anahid Literary Award winner, has distinguished herself as a novelist, poet and lecturer. Her latest book. Dreams of Bread and Fire, will soon go into paperback, as did her 1998 novel Zabelle. She has also won honors for her poetry, and has lectured and taught in several colleges, including Barnard, Columbia, Yale, and Rutgers. A member of the PEN American Center, and Ararat Magazine's Editorial Board, Kricorian is a graduate Columbia University and Dartmouth College where she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa. She is also on the Advisory Board of the Armenia Tree Project, and a member of Code Pink Women for Peace. Kricorian will moderate this much-awaited program, sponsored by The Armenian Center at Columbia University, on November 7, at 7 p.m. It will take place at Barnard College's Held Auditorium, 117th Street and Broadway. The public is cordially invited. Admission is free. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.

"To order Those Intriguing Threes, send $1.00 to Edward Kalinowski, 5 Dogwood Dr., Portland, CT 06480. The message of Fatima has Trinitarian symbolism. The angel appeared three times. The angel repeated prayers three times. The spinning sun reportedly descended in a zigzag motion toward the earth three times, then resumed its normal position. Three children received three messages. Karol Joseph Wojtyla (Pope John Paul II) was the third child of Karol (Sr.) and Emilia Wojtyla. The three theological virtues are faith, hope, and charity. There are three types of love: agape, philia, and eros. Plato spoke of man's tripartite soul consisting of reason, desire, and spirit. Three preternatural gifts are: infused knowledge, absence of concupiscence, and, bodily immortality. The three Western religions are Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Even in Greek and Roman mythology the fates are three in number. Language is composed of three degrees: positive, comparative, and superlative. There are three genders: feminine, masculine, and neuter. Three states exist in equilibrium: liquid, vapor, and solid. Measurement has three modes: length, width, and thickness. Time is past, present, and future. The planet which we know contains life and to which God seems to pay special attention, namely, earth, happens to be in the third orbit from the sun. In ancient Israel, God established prophets, priests, and kings. Jesus Christ fulfills all three in perfection: the perfect prophet (the word of God Himself), the perfect priest (offering the Perfect Sacrifice on the cross), and Christ the King of the universe. In Genesis 18:2, we are told that three angels appeared to Abraham. Poland was partitioned three times in its history by the same three nations, namely, Germany on the west, Russia on the east, and Austria on the south. (The Austrians showed their thanks for Poland's King Sobieski and the Polish army which helped save Vienna from the advancing Ottoman Muslim forces by helping to dismember Poland.) Poland saved Western Europe three times from an infidel and pagan takeover. Once from the Ottoman Empire at Vienna; and twice from Marxism. In 1920, Marshal Pilsudski and the Polish army stopped the Russian Communists at the Battle of Warsaw, thus preventing them from going on to Germany which was prostrate from defeat in World War I. France was also so saved. In 1989, the Polish labor union, Solidarity, under the leadership of Lech Walesa and with the moral backing of the Polish-born pope and President Ronald Reagan brought down the Russian Communist Empire and helped free not only Poland but also Germany, Czechoslovakia and other Communist dominated countries. The World Book Encyclopedia names King John Sobieski of Poland the Savior of Vienna and Western Civilization. Isn't it ironic that the very nation Poland saved from the Ottoman Muslims produced that guttersnipe, Hitler, who gave the orders to decimate Poland in 1939! Had it not been for King John Sobieski and the Polish army, Hitler and the rest of his kind might have been water-carriers for some Muslim mullahs. We never know what the future holds, and neither did Sobieski. Had he known that the future Hitler would emerge from the Austrian nation that he saved, would he have given Vienna over to the Ottoman Muslims? (We can only speculate). When the Communists tried to force the Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty to sign a false confession, he refused. He later said: For the third time they demanded my signature. I refused. For the third time they tried to thrash it out of me with the rubber truncheon which they wielded with undiminished force.

"On August 8, 2003, The Zoryan Institute of Canada, in participation with the Armenian National Committee of Toronto, invited Professor Richard G. Hovannisian to talk about his latest book. Looking Backward, Moving Forward: Confronting the Armenian Genocide. Although the distinguished professor needs no introduction, as he's been in Toronto numerous times. Professor Roger Smith, Emeritus Professor of Government at the College of William and Mary in Virginia, gave a brief biographical sketch of Hovannisian. He said Hovannisian has authored 20 books, including his 5-volume The Republic of Armenia, and has written a slew of articles in prestigious learned journals. The Professor then listed the honors bestowed upon Hovannisian by various countries. Professor Hovannisian first spoke in flawless Armenian for about 10 minutes. He said two things stood out in his trip to Toronto. The first was his encounter with the students of Zoryan Institute's pet project: A university credit course about Genocides and Human Rights, where he met students who had come from different countries - Armenians and non-Armenians - to learn the intricacies of genocides. Speaking about Zoryan Institute's project, he said, It was encouraging to see 25 young people take interest in the field of Human Rights. The second was my informing you about The Boston Globe's determination not to shy away, henceforth, from using the word Genocide. His book. Looking Backward, Moving Forward: Confronting the Armenian Genocide, is a collection of various genocide scholars' submissions, including a Turk, and he closed his Armenian speech reverberating those authors' works. Switching to English, he reiterated the Zoryan Institute's project. He said he was gratified to see people from Europe, even Turkey, the Far East, and various parts of the United States and Canada, who have come together to understand the phenomenon of genocide, both the victim and perpetrator societies. He said, We are all victims. Perpetrators are victims. Victims are victims, and time goes on. Even those who are forced to deny continuously, are victimized and traumatized. The perpetrators need to create a mythology. They say they're being stereotyped and the world doesn't understand them. The victims for a hundred years haven't been able to use their great talents to their full potential. The flower of the Armenian people has always been creativity. They built and rebuilt. Those of you who are familiar with Armenian history know that it has been a very troubled one, repeated destruction. Rebuilding occurred as soon as the crisis is over. The tragedy of the Armenian Genocide is not imagined, because there is no one left to rebuild. The Armenians were left without soil under their feet. The story will find no resonance and no echo. There is a challenge for the youth gathered here today and for the activists of the community. For us scholars or writers or students of the phenomenon, the challenge is to integrate the Armenian experience into the general experience of humankind. By the end of the 21st century, I doubt the world will know and remember. I am not confident the world will remember Rwanda. Already my students know nothing Cambodia. And Armenia, some place unknown geographically! But when I look around me, I see increasing numbers of volumes written by non-Armenians relating to issues not specifically Armenian, but relating to human rights. I see the word Armenian more and more prevalent. A year ago, Pulitzer prizewinner Samantha Powers of Harvard University wrote A Problem from Hell, in which the Armenian Genocide runs throughout the book. The book is being used in courses of International Relations and also in the U.S. diplomatic courses. Here we should be pleased. The phenomenon of genocide has far-reaching consequences that both perpetrators and victims cannot shake it from their consciousness. The government in Ankara and the authorities of the Turkish state are aware of the progress that's been made by diverse and divided community of Armenians around the world. We've all grown up with stories. Some of us have personal stories of family members. Many of us have grown up with the stereotypical terrible Turk and thinking them as being genetically predisposed and evil. But you have the opportunity to examine in depth what happened and what occurred. The Armenian Genocide occurred a full generation before the war. The Holocaust is known and studied, inside and out, from every angle: Literature, sociology, politics, and economics. In comparison to the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide is in its infancy. We know so little except for the results. Do you know exactly what it was the Young Turk government decided? We commemorate April 24, but do you know what the decision-making process was? We're not responsible for not knowing because the evidence has not yet been made available. The absence of denial in the mainstream German society, the acceptance of crimes and confessional trials is not normal. It is abnormal. All who have committed crimes try to avoid responsibility. The Germans had no option, because every foot of Germany was occupied. They could do nothing. The Turkish government immediately after World War I accepted responsibility and began the process of trying the perpetrators, the Young Turks. But the process was interrupted because the country was not fully occupied by the Allied powers. The information is probably there. But we have a non-cooperative Turkish government and non-cooperative Turkish intellectual establishments that cooperate with the state in perpetuating the denial. This brings us to the question of dialogue with our Turkish colleagues and what they can do for us. There has been progress recently. Thirty and twenty years ago I could not find a Turkish scholar who would sit down with me and talk in terms of de facto Genocide. Yes, there were a few Turkish poets who related the story of what happened to Garabed. I'm appreciative of that. But in the last two decades, lonely voices are being heard from Turkey. Turkish voices from Europe are being heard. They say we need to know what happened. We need to confront this issue for our own sake. We need to face our history. And these lonely voices, which are scorned by the establishment are gradually increasing one by one. And we need to understand, as Armenians, what happened. Because the victims blame themselves for their misery. These lonely voices are giving us such information. I don't any longer engage in debates whether there was a genocide or not. I find that a waste of my time. I'm too old for that. There are other things to be done. I have a hundred things to do rather than be talking about genocide. I will not listen to a member of the Turkish establishment coming to me with crazy documentation and quotations out of context try to create the rationalization and excuses. But I am willing to talk to Turkish scholars who will sit with me and try to understand what happened. I went to the second meeting of scholars at the University of Michigan where there were several Turkish and Armenian scholars. I found this to be useful because I was given information about Turkish memoirs of political leaders from their own archives. I came to the conclusion that there was nothing Armenians could have done. Their fate had already been determined. They tell me that, based on Turkish memoirs, individuals and players in World War I point the finger to the war prior to World War I, namely, the Balkan War (19121913). The former colonies of the Ottoman Empire, now independent states - Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Montenegro - with support from Russia, defeated the Ottomans. They lost all their remaining European territories. But the pride of the Turkish Empire was not Anatolia. They looked at Anatolia as backwater. Turkish nationalism was developed in late 19th century. The only fallback for them was now their Asiatic provinces, and that was going to be their last bastion and they were to defend it to death The concept was to create a Turkic state As a result of the Balkan Wars and the rise of Turkish nationalism as reflected by the intellectuals of the Young Turk movement, the decision was already made. They decided that in the Turkish Empire Armenians should not constitute more than 5 per cent of the population. But what do you do with Van where Armenians constituted 60 to 70 per cent? What do you do with Erzrum and Kharpert? In other words, the process and the decision to cleanse Asia Minor, the last bastion of Turkism, was made before World War I. It was made before there was any type of Armenian uprising in Van. It was made even before Dashnaktsutiun was collaborating with the Young Turks. This is important information, because it tells me the plan was there. The question comes as to when the plan was implemented. For that we need more information. We have a lot of circumstantial information. We have a lot of bits and pieces of information. The plan was there but what was the trigger? And we get closer to the answer as time goes on. The disastrous campaign of Enver Pasha in December 1914 only two months after Turkey entered the war, when he led 100,000 men of the Third Army into Erzrum and decided that in the middle of winter, in the blizzard-ridden highland known as the Armenian Plateau, to try and strike at the Russian Army at Sari Kamish, Kars and to get to Baku. That plan he undertook was against the advice of the chief of staff. It ended un a fiasco and the capture of 80% of the army by the Russians. When he came back to Constantinople he presented himself to the Patriarch of Constantinople and said the Armenians were very loyal. They fought very well against the enemy. Was this a camouflage of what he was planning? I welcome the participation of individual Turkish scholars, but the first step there should be consensus on what occurred. One day, not in my lifetime, the authorities in Ankara will decide that it is to their own benefit to be truthful. There is a campaign of disinformation, continuous denial, and continuous blackmail of governments that need to use their bases. What we have not thought out carefully, once again, that so much energy has gone into the effort of gaining international reaffirmation because I don't believe in the question of recognition. The world has recognized it so many times. The Canadian government, the Canadian parliament, the American government, the American Congress recognized at the time and subsequently so many times. Azad, Angakh Hayastan - Is this something we should perpetuate? Should we say we need reparations? Even in the Christian religion confession requires penance. What should the penance be? Is it money? Is it Mount Ararat, as some Turks have been suggesting? But Turks have a saying, Toprak alinir - verilmez, meaning, they can grab others' land, but never yield land they own. I cannot speak for the Armenians, and I think no one here can speak for the Armenians. These issues ultimately, I suppose, come down to what the Armenian state should do. For that, I expect the Armenian state should itself take the initiative to determine what the boundaries are. Should we be calling on members of the academic sciences? Should we seek the advice of human rights activists and Armenian scholars from abroad? Do we invite a conference to discuss these issues? It remains a challenge for us. I think I've spoken longer than I wanted to. I'd like to turn to this new book of mine, because I'm pleased to say that we no longer feel the necessity to just describe the issue. It has already been done, but there's much more work. Some Armenians survived because there was a non-Armenian who intervened in their most difficult moments and assisted them in some way, whether for personal gain, as in the case of my father, or because of religious conviction of devout Muslim mullahs. We find that in most cases the interveners did not know the victims, but there was something in their lives and their spirit, their personal way that they felt 'mekhk en.' Two days later, The Zoryan Institute of Canada had another lecture session at AGBU (Armenian General Benevolent Union) where three distinguished genocide scholars of the ten on the faculty of Zoryan Institute's pet project spoke: Rouben Adalian, Taner Akcam, and Roger Smith.

"September 11 is the anniversary of a great American tragedy when about 3000 peaceful people were killed. All Americans are now aware of Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda. But very few people know that eight years before terrorists appeared in New York's sky, the same Bin Laden's mujaheddins (soldiers) attacked the Karabagh Armenians. Aliyev rewarded Bin Laden by letting Al Qaeda function freely. This shocking information was recently published by the Armenian National Committee of America. We, Armenians of America, must remind and explain to everyone that the Armenian Genocide and today's blast of terrorism activity have very much in common. Terrorism and genocide are virtually the same because, in both cases, innocent people are killed in the name of inhuman doctrines. Everybody should take part in the war against terrorists by all the means and abilities at their disposal. That's why, being a professional seaman, I offer to undertake the mission of traveling around the world on a sailboat, in the memory of all innocent victims. I am ready to sail alone but any sailor is welcome to join me. The boat must have on board all the names and pictures of the victims of terrorism. I aim to show the world that terrorists are not heroes, rather just murderers. The real heroes are the victims, the firefighters, and the rescue workers. America does not have to be viewed as an eyesore by misinformed people or those who can only proclaim it as sour grapes. And this great country does not need to be destroyed to make those who are less prosperous feel better about themselves and their particular social order. We must carry this message all over the world, and especially to the Muslim world. Most certainly, terrorists will try to stop this mission in any way they can. It is therefore necessary to create a recognized and influential coordination center in the United States, which will receive information from the boat and support it, if needed. I am calling everyone who is willing to get involved in the founding of such a center. Please contact me and let us work together. All my life I have served on merchant ships, having been promoted from seaman to deep sea captain. I will be more than happy to show anyone who is interested that an around-the-world voyage is a very realistic idea, which can draw tremendous attention from the international media. I feel physically and spiritually ready for this trip. Being an Armenian from Karabagh, I know very well what is meant by genocide and terrorism. There is no doubt in my mind that this mission is my duty and the main purpose of my life, as my contribution to the fight against terrorism. The memories of the victims must be kept alive; we must remember them and never forget that they were killed unjustly. I am looking forward to hearing from you in the near future. I need someone to back me up while I am out in the ocean. Please join me in my efforts. God bless you and America.

"ANKARA - Parliament voted overwhelmingly on October 7 to give the Turkish Government permission to send troops to Iraq, but Iraq's interim council strongly opposed the move, one more of many problems Washington faces as it tries to assemble a peacekeeping force. The United States has been pressing Turkey for months to send what would be the first major Muslim contingent of peacekeepers, a deployment which the Bush Administration argues could enhance the credibility of the American-led force in Iraq by demonstrating Muslim support (although a number of experts contend that it would exacerbate the situation). Turkey's Parliament voted 358183 to allow the government to dispatch troops, a move top officials said would improve ties with Washington and help give Turkey a say in the future of Iraq. An Iraq that is in peace, that is on good terms with its neighbors, an Iraq that is stable is in Turkey's interests, said Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul. In Washington, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan applauded the Turkish vote, saying we welcome that decision, and we will be working with Turkish officials on the details of their decision. The motion gives the Turkish Government power to send troops, but it provides no details as to when, where or how many soldiers would be deployed. Those matters are expected to be worked out in talks with Washington that could take weeks or even months. The decision that came out of Parliament is not one that will be executed immediately, this instant, said Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Time will decide. The process will depend on developments. The 15-member, US-appointed Governing Council of Iraq met at about the same time as the Turkish Parliament. After long deliberations, we reached consensus on issuing a statement opposing the arrival of Turkish troops, said Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish member of the council. The council already has said it does not want other foreign troops in the country. He also said, however, that the release of the statement was delayed for a short while, apparently due to pressure from the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority. The Council is likely to defer to the United States on issues involving security. Mr. Gul dismissed the Iraqi Council's action. Members with Kurdish origins thought that way, but in the end, they decided that it wouldn't be right, he said when asked about the statement. But Mr. Gul also seemed to address some of their concerns. Turkey has no secret designs over Iraq, he added. We won't be going there to prolong the occupation; on the contrary, to shorten it. Council members have repeatedly underscored that they would prefer if peacekeepers are not sent from neighboring countries. The Turkish Ottoman Empire ruled today's Iraq for about 400 years until World War I. For some 15 years, Turkey fought Kurdish rebels who now have bases in the Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, a fight which killed 37,000 people, mostly Kurds. Turkey fears that Kurds living in an autonomous area of northern Iraq could declare independence, which might provoke Kurds residing in eastern Turkey. Turkish officials have tried to emphasize, however, that any deployment would aim at ending instability in Iraq, chaos that Turks fear could spread. $8.5 BILLION LOAN In a related development, the Washington-based American Hellenic Institute sharply criticized the US Treasury's decision on September 22 to extend Turkey an $8.5 billion loan. In light of Turkey's non-role in the Iraq war, it's just incredulous that any American money, at all, is earmarked for Turkey, said AHI Executive Director Nick Larigakis. Mr. Larigakis also objected to the loan on the grounds that the US economy is still in recession, citing the huge economic fallout caused by Hurricane Isabel last month. That loan is slated for Turkey's domestic and foreign debt and was issued on two conditions: First, Turkey must use the money to improve its economic policies. And second, Turkey must cooperate with the US on Iraq. According to the terms, Turkey is not obliged to contribute troops for peacekeeping and stability operations in exchange for the loan or as a way to cooperate with the US on Iraq. According to recent reports in the Greek American press, Patrick Theros, former US Ambassador to Qatar, also criticized the recent loan agreement, saying that the so-called neocons (who many experts say have hijacked US foreign policy within the Bush Administration) are enamored with Turkey, and frankly, I'm awestruck that otherwise intelligent people would go down this path. But Mr. Theros also told the Greek American press that the loan could strengthen the moderately-Islamist civilian government of Mr. Erdogan, an outcome which he said would be a welcome change from the repressive Kemalist policies of the past, under which religious expression in Turkey was very stilted.

"A starred review in Publishers Weekly, a superb review in Kirkus Reviews and advance praise from major scholars in the United States and England have launched Peter Balakian's new, groundbreaking history of the Armenian Genocide - The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response to be published by HarperCollins October 7, 2003 (on sale September 30). Peter Balakian's The Burning Tigris is a gripping treatment of the official Turkish mass murder of a whole people, an event which adds its insane horror to the copious disgrace earned by the 20th century. The book, fully documented with appalling details, is a masterpiece of moral history, and it needs to be widely read. - Paul Fussell, author of The Great War and Modern Memory The terrible fate of the Armenians, whose attempted destruction provided a template for the Jewish Holocaust, is brilliantly described, as is the remarkable response of the United States, in the face of a humanitarian tragedy of a type that has, unfortunately, been repeated again and again, into our twenty-first century. Peter Balakian has done a great service to the history of the Armenians. - Sir Martin Gilbert, author of The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust The Burning Tigris is a much needed act of acute historical memory, of personal testimony, of prophetic witness - and of high art. This brutal past, in Balakian's brave and scholarly recounting, prepares us for a more humane future. - James Carroll, author of Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews: A History This is the only study of a particular genocide that fully records the motivations of perpetrators, the suffering of victims, and the responses of the outside world. Balakian brilliantly integrates all of these dimensions so that they become a single, compelling narrative. This book will be a classic, in terms of what it says about genocide and about American - and broadly human - struggles to come to terms with it. - Robert Jay Lifton, author of Nazi Doctors and Destroying The World to Save It The Armenian Genocide is a double tragedy: the tragedy of the horrific event itself and the contemporary tragedy of its denial by Turkey. Peter Balakian tells the powerful and largely unknown story of America's response to both these tragedies. This important and compelling book is long overdue. - Deborah E. Lipstadt, author of Denying The Holocaust August 18, 2003, Publishers Weekly Starred Review THE BURNING TIGRIS: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response PETER BALAKIAN, HarperCollins, $26.95 (496p) ISBN 0-06-019840-0 Now faded from memory in the shadow of the Holocaust, the Turkish slaughter of more than a million Armenians in 1915-1916 was a virtual template for the 20th-century horrors that followed and much of what Balakian describes so powerfully is now chillingly familiar: inhuman brutality; mass deportations of helpless civilians (often in overcrowded railroad boxcars); headlines screaming of systematic race extermination; activists and intellectuals calling for intervention; and, most devastatingly, the lack of political will in the West to intervene to stop the slaughter. Balakian exposes the roots of the genocide in the total war atmosphere of WWI, which combusted in the pan-Turkish nationalism of the Young Turk government, inflamed Muslim rage against infidel Armenian Christians, and a long-simmering Ottoman hatred of the Armenians dating to Sultan Abdul Hamid II and his slaughters in the 1890s. Balakian, who wrote so movingly about the impact of the genocide on his own family in Black Dog of Fate, also underscores how well known the Armenian destruction was in America through detailed reports by U.S. consuls throughout Turkey and steady newspaper reporting, and how great the response was in providing humanitarian assistance to refugees and survivors. In a horrifying account, city by city, region by region, Balakian quotes firsthand testimony about the decimation of the Armenian population and their towns and culture. Yet he retains the measured tone of a historian throughout; if anything, he lets Woodrow Wilson off too easily for not declaring war on Turkey. But readers will come away sadly convinced that Armenians' brave but doomed stand in Van should be as celebrated as the Warsaw ghetto uprising, and the corpse-strewn Lake Goeljuk as well known as Babi Yar. August 1, 2003, Kirkus Reviews An eloquent account of Turkey's long campaign to rid itself of Armenians - and far longer campaign to disavow any responsibility for crimes against humanity. During the 1890s, writes memoirist (Black Dog of Fate, 1997) and poet Balakian, Sultan Abdul Hamid II launched a campaign of extermination against Armenia's Christians, killing about 200,000 in a two-year period and setting the template for most of the genocide that followed in the twentieth century. The Ottoman Empire's resorting to state-sponsored murder against the Armenians was not without precedent; a few years earlier, the same sultan had ordered the massacre of thousands of Bulgarians who had been pressing for independence. Yet this crime was unprovoked, and it outraged the world; in the US, millions of dollars were raised for Armenian relief, and at the turn of the century nearly every American schoolchild could find Armenia on the map... Balakian estimates that between 1.2 and 1.3 million Armenians were killed in the years between 1915 and 1922, though some historians put the figure at 1.5 million. Again, writes Balakian, American sentiment was with the Armenians, many survivors among whom emigrated to the US. But in the years since, despite the Turkish government's crimes against its people, the Armenian genocide has been gone unacknowledged, the product of a sinister Turkish campaign of denial that is perhaps singular in the annals of history - a campaign that, Balakian says, successfully persuaded Bill Clinton to kill a House measure to commemorate the genocide for the sake of 'national security.' Thoroughly convincing - and one more reason for the governments of the West...to be ashamed. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2003-09-13,1
"THE rights of an Illinoisbased Muslim leader were seriously violated when immigration officials in Shannon revoked his right to reenter the U.S., new appeal documents have claimed. Dr. Sabri Samirah, president of the United Muslim Americans Association, spent a night in an Irish jail before returning to Jordan where he has been living since U.S. immigration officials in Shannon blocked his re-entry into the U.S. last January. The appeal follows news that Irish woman Bridget Reuter has been stuck in Ireland since November after she was blocked from boarding a U.S.-bound plane at Shannon, allegedly because she did not have the required advanced parole to leave the U.S. Her lawyer told the Irish Voice that immigration officials in Shannon were implementing a far tougher regime than other U.S. immigration inspection points. In the Samirah case, his lawyers claim that officials in Shannon stopped him from boarding a Chicago-bound flight after receiving notification from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), now the Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services, that Samirah was a risk to U.S. national security. In March, a Chicago district court judge strongly criticized the actions of the INS and said the case had a gotcha factor that was demeaning to the U.S. However, an appeals court in Chicago later ruled that the Department of Homeland Security had the right to refuse permission to a resident alien to re-enter the U.S., even after the department has granted the person permission to leave the country. Samirah's lawyer, Mark A. Flessner, is now seeking an en bloc hearing by the entire panel of 7th Circuit Appeal Court judges. In the appeal request lodged this week, Flessner claimed that Samirah has the serendipitous misfortune of being processed at the U.S. immigration station in Shannon, rather than on U.S. soil, as he was not granted a full immigration hearing before a U.S. judge. He added that Samirah's rights to due process of law has been ignored. Samirah, who lived in the U.S for 15 years and has a family living in Illinois, says in court documents that he left the U.S. to visit a sick relative in Jordan in January and has not been allowed to return since. The Department of Homeland Security has agreed in court that the INS granted Samirah advance parole to leave the country while his green card application was being processed. However, the INS revoked his advanced parole when he arrived a pre-inspection station at Shannon Airport and said in a fax to Samirah that he was a risk to U.S. national security. The filing also claims that Congress has not authorized pre-inspection stations to exclude an immigrant to whom the government had previously granted advance parole, without first allowing an immigration hearing. The 7th Circuit Appeal Court is expected to decide in the next month on whether to grant a full 11 judge hearing to Samirah.","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2003-09-09,1

"By the time Turkish Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul concluded his meetings with senior Bush administration officials and congressional leaders last week, in an urgent and appropriately-timed effort to repair Turkey's frayed relations with the United States, he realized the old saying that Turkey has no friends is not true. America has long been Turkey's best friend, dating back to the beginning of the Cold War. It still is, but that friendship has been severely tested in recent months by Ankara, highlighted by Turkey's failure to support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Turkish fury over the arrest and detention by US forces of Turkish commandos planning to assassinate a Kurdish leader in northern Iraq. Since the early 1950's, US policymakers have held Turkey in high esteem as a secular, democratic Muslim nation confronting Soviet forces on its border and anchoring NATO's southeastern flank with a standing army second in size only to that of the United States. After the Cold War, Washington touted Turkey's significance as a strategic partner which facilitated US efforts to stabilize the former Yugoslavia and Somalia, while also combating terrorism and potential threats from rogue regimes in Iraq, Iran and Syria on its southern and eastern borders. For more than a decade, Incirlik Air Base became the focal point for US and British aircraft protecting Kurds within the No-Fly Zone in northern Iraq. By the mid-1990's, Turkey had cemented a security and economic relationship with Israel. After the US defeated the Taliban in Afghanistan, Turkey successfully completed a six-month rotating command of the international security force in Kabul. For its part, the US provided economic and military assistance to Turkey when Josef Stalin threatened it after World War II, supported Turkey's entry into NATO in 1952, encouraged the country's expanding democracy over the decades, and generally supported or tolerated Turkish foreign policy and security objectives, sometimes at the expense of relations with other allies and friends. The Bush and Clinton Administrations have strongly supported Ankara's aspirations to become a member of the European Union. President Bush endorsed a $16 billion International Monetary Fund loan package which was essential to shoring up Turkey's failing economy and averting economic meltdown. The US backed construction of the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline, which could make Turkey a key transport node for bringing Caspian Sea oil to international markets. In addition, it assisted Turkey in resolving disputes with the EU over the deployment of the bloc's Rapid Reaction Force. Washington has worked to gently nudge a reluctant Turkey toward a Cyprus settlement which would dramatically increase living standards for Turkish Cypriots and enhance Ankara's diplomatic stature with the EU and the international community. The US has long encouraged dialogue between Greece and Turkey to resolve their bilateral differences, and it was Washington's intervention, while Europe slept, which prevented war between the two countries in 1996. Starting in late 2002, however, and culminating on March 1 of this year, Turkey's image in Washington as a staunch ally and friend steadily and radically diminished. US military planners once considered Turkish cooperation necessary to wage a quick and decisive two-front war against Iraq. Months prior to the war, Washington embarked on exhausting negotiations with Ankara to gain access to Turkish territory for the deployment of 62,000 US troops and equipment, which included the 4th Infantry Division as the spearhead to secure northern Iraq and lead the southward offensive toward Baghdad. In December, Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz returned from Ankara assured by the Turkish General Staff that Turkey was on board, save for details. Negotiations culminated in a proposed US grant and loan credit package exceeding $30 billion. But on March 1, Turkish Parliament rejected America's request for territorial access for a second front against Saddam Hussein. After that stunning defeat, Turkish leaders pressed for further negotiations in hopes that accommodation might be reached, but those talks led nowhere. The failure to reach an agreement prevented the world's most modern and lethal army division from attacking Saddam's forces from the north, compelling US planners to wage a one-front war. Turkey then refused to permit combat air operations to originate from its territory, negating the use of the once-strategic lncirlik Air Base by Coalition warplanes for the duration of the war. Turkey permitted flights carrying humanitarian supplies to transit its air space, in return for a Washington pledge of $1 billion in aid. Since the Coalition's victory in late April, Turkey has had the opportunity to be helpful by not interfering in US-led efforts to secure Iraq and establish institutions which will lead to a federal state of Kurds, Turkomen, and Assyrians in the north, Sunnis in central Iraq, and Shi'ites in the south. But Turkey has continued to express its long-standing concern that a semi-autonomous Kurdish entity in northern Iraq, governed by elected representatives of 3 million Kurds, would inspire a separatist fervor among Turkey's 12 million ethnic Kurds, many of whom bore the brunt of a 15-year war which killed 35,000 people. There have been reports of recurring Kurdish attacks inside Turkey, and Ankara faults Washington for permitting Kurdish groups to control the oil-rich regions of Mosul and Kirkuk. US officials reject Turkish mistrust of American motives, especially since Washington stood alone among Western capitals for many years in its condemnation of Kurdish separatists as terrorists, in line with Turkish policy. GROSS INTERFERENCE The Turkish commandos' attempt to assassinate a Kurdish politician, thwarted only by their timely capture by American troops, was viewed by Washington as gross interference with US objectives, threatening to trigger violent turmoil across northern Iraq and delaying establishment of a governing system for all of postwar Iraq. Turkey had the opportunity to participate significantly in this successful war, as well as in the shaping of postwar Iraq, and its parliament opted on March 1 not to do so. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has frequently stated, actions have consequences. Hopefully, Mr. Gul is returning to Ankara convinced that Turkish policymakers must come to terms with the US and British triumph in Iraq, achieved without any political, financial or logistical support from Ankara. The Bush Administration is not about to let Turkey's unfounded fears over the future of Iraq's Kurds ruin all that the US and its Coalition partners have accomplished through loss of life and limb. Ankara should reassess its policies in northern Iraq and accept US assurances that Coalition forces will strive to create a democratic federal state in Iraq. American forces will be stationed in Iraq for many years to come. Ideally, Turkish troops will be stationed there as well, alongside troops from other NATO members and nations seeking to help reform and democratize the Middle East and broader Muslim world. But the Pentagon will not beg for Turkish troops, and Mr. Gul smartly avoided insisting on unrealistic conditions for such deployment. It is in Turkey's interest to participate in the reconstruction of Iraq, and it is in America's interest to have a constructive Turkish partner which respects American sacrifices and shares its vision for the future of the region. As Mr. Gul was clearly told when he was here, Washington has no intention of abandoning Iraq to civil war, anarchy and dismemberment. Instead, Kurds, Sunnis and Shi'ites are each expected to govern autonomously in Iraq - and protect the rights of smaller minorities such as the Turkomen - in a system somewhat akin to Texans, Virginians and Alaskans in the US federal system. This eventuality can be constructive for Turkey, which can not destabilize northern Iraq and expect to progress in its EU accession program or its partnership with the United States. Mr. Gul came to Washington with a singular opportunity to repair the fissure in relations with Administration. Ankara and Washington can - and must - put the latest incidents behind them and work together toward the stabilization of Iraq and the establishment of an Iraqi democracy. Further degradation of Turkish-American relations, through activities such as other covert operations, would be the quickest way to ruin Turkey's longterm friendship with the United States. That might make, for the first time in half a century, the old Turkish saying come true. [Editor's Note: The abover article was published by the Washington Times on July 27.

"With the completion of a successful visit to Croatia, where he encouraged the war-ravaged populace and beatified four, Pope John Paul II looked forward to a briefer visit to Bosnia at the end of June, again as an ambassador of peace and reconciliation. Meeting with Orthodox hierarchs in Croatia, the pope welcomed the prospect of visiting Serbia-Montenegro. The visit would promote reconciliation between Roman Catholics and Orthodox faithful as well as help integrate Serbia-Montenegro into the European fold after years of warfare. The Serbian Orthodox officials might also serve as a bridge to the Russian Orthodox church which has stiffly resisted all overtures for dialogue with Rome and a papal visit to Russia. The pope had hoped to stop off in Kazan, Russia on his way to Mongolia in August. There he planned to restore to the Russians an 18th-century copy of the icon of Our Lady of Kazan that has been hanging in the papal apartments since it was given to the pope for safe keeping by a member of the Blue Army (a group devoted to Fatima) who bought it from a Russian nobleman. Russian Orthodox spokesmen dismissed the offer of the icon as insignificant in light of the perceived offense of Catholic convert-making in Orthodox Russia. The pope's plans to visit Mongolia may be postponed in any case due to the threat of the SARS virus in east Asia. BOOKS OF INTEREST. Jose Ramon Garitagoitia Eguia's John Paul II's Ethical and Political Thought, published by the Center of Political and Constitutional Studies of Spain, explores the ethical implications of the economic, social and political thought in the pope's speeches and writings. Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev wrote the prologue to the book and praises the pope for his attention to the relation between morality and politics. Eric Kampmann's Tree of Life: A Book of Wisdom for Men (New York: Beaufort Books, 2003) presents selections of readings from the Wisdom books of the Old Testament for each day throughout the year. Fr. Bronislaw Czaplicki's Hide Me Within They Wounds (Germans From Russia Heritage Collection, 2003) documents in 600 pages the systematic persecution of Catholics in Soviet Russia's work camps, prisons, and daily life. Chronicled in the book are the infiltration and compromise of the Russian Orthodox Church by the Soviet secret police KGB. The 600,000 Catholics who remain in Russia still face mistrust and hostility from many quarters of the Orthodox church leadership. Fr. Czaplicki was one of several priests recently expelled from Russia. RELIGIOUS FORCED TO WITH-DRAW. The Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth have announced that they will withdraw from their co-sponsorship with the Sisters of Bon Secours of Altoona, Pa.'s Bon Secours hospital and regional health system.

The Fr. Justin Rosary Hour started at the parish in 1926 but now broadcasts from the nearby suburb of Athol Springs.

"The changing nature of Irish life is reflected in the full results of the 2002 census, as the numbers demonstrate how immigration is increasing the diversity of the nation. The total population has grown 8 percent since 1996, and now stands at 3.917 million. Nearly 6 percent of the people who live in Ireland are not citizens of Ireland, and more than 400,000 people (pr 10.4 percent) of people who live in Ireland weren't born here, up from 250,000 in 1996. Some 200,000 residents, or (5.1 percent), were born in Britain, with nearly 51,000 (1.3 percent) born in the North. People born in the US formed 0.6 percent of the population, up from 0.4 percent in 1991 and 1996. People born in countries other than the US or Britain form 2.5 percent of the population. Nearly 650.000 people who live in Ireland have lived abroad for at least a year. Almost 60 percent of these lived in Britain, 8 percent in other EU countries, and 9 percent lived in the US. Over a third of those who have lived outside of Ireland either moved here for the first time or returned home in the 1996-2000 period, with another 15 percent in the five years before that. The statistics show that emigration is still a fact of life among the young. Although in total there were 25,000 more people moving to Ireland than leaving, the 15-24 year-old age group continued to record a net loss due to migration. The net outward migration figure for that age group was 13,800 during the 1996-2002 period. Immigration is responsible for an increase in Ireland's. Muslim population, which has more than quadrupled over the last decade, to 19,000. The population of Orthodox Christians has increased from under 400 in 1991 to over 10,000. While there had been a long-term decline in the numbers of Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and Methodists, this trend reversed over the past decade; the CSO says that immigration was a major influence in this. Meanwhile the percentage of Catholics has declined from 91.6 percent in 1991 to 88.4 percent, although the actual number increased as a result of immigration. The population has moved to the cities, with six out of ten people living in urban areas; at the time of the foundation of the State, fewer than one in three lived in cities. For the first time, over half the population now lives in Leinster. Irish families are getting smaller, with the average number of children per family declining from 2.2 in 1986 to 1.6 in 2002. The number of divorced people has tripled since 1996, from 9,800 to 35,100. Divorce was legalised in 1997. There were over 77,000 couples living together without being married; a third of those had at least one child. More people said they could speak Irish in 2002 than 1996, up to 1.57 million from 1.43 million. In percentage terms, however, this was a slight decline from 43.5 percent to 42.8 percent.","Ferrie, Liam",The Boston Irish Reporter,2003-07-31,1
"Poland has influenced the course of history on several occasions. The 1683 victory over the Turks at Vienna under King Jan II Sobieski probably averted the Muslim takeover of Europe. Poland's 1920 defeat of invading Soviet hordes outside Warsaw prevented a bloody Bolshevik revolution from engulfing the continent. And most recently, Solidarity's peaceful revolution led to the collapse of the iron curtain and the Soviet Union itself. But all these events took place within the confines of the Poles' own continent. Now for the first time, our ancestral homeland is playing a prominent international role thousands of miles from home. Poland now commands a stabilization zone in post-war Iraq that stretches from that country's borders with Iran all the way to the Saudi frontier. It will be policed by an international corps of 7,000 troops, including some 2,000 Polish soldiers. That is ten times the 200-strong military contingent Warsaw initially contributed to the U.S.-led Operation Iraqi Freedom. This new and unprecedented role has filled Poles and Polonians with understandable pride. But the Poles also deserve respect for the intelligent way they have handled the matter and the restraint they have displayed in the face of degrading insults from their Franco-German NATO allies. Those countries' leaders have expressed extreme displeasure at Poland's decision to join the coalition forces, and have even hinted this could adversely affect Warsaw's bid for European Union membership. Some of those countries' media were far more explicit, calling the Poles America's Trojan jackass, Yankee mercenaries, and Bush's lapdogs. But the Poles did not gloat nor rub their tormentors face in it after being entrusted with the command of one of Iraq's post-war occupation zones. They willingly accepted the challenge but were fully aware of their limited experience and funds. Hence Polish diplomats immediately set about trying to obtain a UN mandate for and NATO involvement in the undertaking. Ultimately NATO has agreed to provide the Polish command with logistic support, a move widely seen as helping to bridge the rift that developed in the North Atlantic Alliance over the Iraqi conflict. Warsaw is also seeking to involve troops from friendly Muslim countries in its stabilization effort to enhance its credibility in the Arab world. Poland, which had never been a colonial power, is viewed far more favorably in the Persian Gulf region than the remaining coalition forces. The fact that Communist Poland had sided with the Arabs (although it had been forced to do so by the Soviets) is also fondly remembered in that part of the globe. The way things have played out so far seem the reflect the well-known saying about being in the right place at the right time. Poland was there at a time when the Bush Administration was being snubbed by Berlin, Paris and Brussels and desperately needed allies. The Polish contingent in Iraq, though small, admirably performed a number of crucial and sensitive combat tasks. Warsaw now also stands to recoup some of the more than $1 billion worth of the debts owed by the defunct regime of Saddam Hussein when its construction firms help rebuild the war-torn country. Poland's new international presence may also have an unexpected impact on the European Union, which Poland will probably join within a year. Those who fear EU membership will mean a total loss of sovereignty could be in for a pleasant surprise. As the largest country of what U.S. Defense Secretary has termed the new Europe, Poland has been promoting NATO enlargement and supporting the European aspirations of its former Soviet bloc neighbors -- Ukraine, Lithuania and Slovakia. Warsaw's active involvement in the anti-Saddam coalition has made it the symbolic leader of the many European countries that declared support for the operation but stopped short of sending troops so as not to antagonize the continent's Franco-German biggies. ALTHOUGH PARIS AND BERLIN hope to remain the European Union's dominant continental power centers, they may get a run for their money. As East-Central Europe's growing regional power, Poland is now in an excellent position to become a leader of the new Europe. Unlike the old Europe of such cynical agnostics as French Presdient Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, Poland could become an important cornerstone of a new coalition embracing such Catholic countries as Spain, Italy and Portugal as well as Free World fellow-newcomers Lithuania, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. Who knows if such a coalition, backed in many cases by Britain, could not outvote libertine France, Germany, Benelux and Scandinavia when major ethical issues come to the fore. These could include euthanasia, genetic tampering, soft drugs and same-sex marriages. But much will depend on further developments within Iraq's Polishled stabilization zone as well as on Warsaw's relations with the rest of Europe and America. In effect, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski is performing a delicate balancing act. Although he has staked his reputation on Poland's membership in the European Union, its major European allies were less than happy when he signed onto the American-led Operation Iraqi Freedom. To a large extent the move reflected Poland's long-standing love affair with America. But some observers feel that Kwasniewski, who cannot be re-elected after his second presidential term in office ends n 2005, has his sights set on a major international position such NATO secretary-general. That would definitely require staying on Washington's good side. But the combination of national interests, political goals and personal ambitions is certainly nothing new. In fact, such intertwining multiple motives have usually been the motor force that make things happen.","Strybel, Robert","Polish American Journal, National ed.",2003-07-31,1
"There is a 211-year history behind St. Mary's Seminary & University of Baltimore, MD, the first such seminary founded on this continent, by the Society of Saint Sulpice, a community of diocesan clergy dedicated to training parish priests. It has continuously prepared candidates for the Roman Catholic priesthood. The Ecumenical Institute of Theology within the Seminary has offered fully accredited graduate studies in theology for clergy, members of religious orders, laypeople of all faith traditions, and the general public since 1968. This was the venue where His Beatitude Mesrob II, the Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and all Turkey, was invited on May 15, 2003 to be conferred upon the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity. His Eminence William Cardinal Keeler, Archbishop of Baltimore and the Chancellor of the University and the faculty, was the host of the event and His Beatitude the Patriarch was the Cardinal's personal guest. His Beatitude arrived in Baltimore on May 14 and was greeted by the representatives of the Cardinal, Bishop Viken Aykazian, Diocesan Legate, and the Director of the Ecumenical Affairs of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of the Eastern Diocese; and the Rev. Fr. Vertanes Kalayjian, Pastor of St. Mary Armenian Church in Washington, DC. A VIP reception was afforded to His Beatitude at the airport and he was escorted to his residence to recover from his long journey. May 15 was a full day for His Beatitude. In the early afternoon, the faculty, headed by the President Rector and Vice Chancellor of the Ecclesiastical Faculty, the Very Rev. Robert F. Leavitt, SS, S.T.D., met with His Beatitude in a cordial atmosphere of dialogue. In mid-afternoon His Beatitude met with the Cardinal at his residence, where the Patriarch was given a personal tour of the compound in the heart of historic Baltimore. In an informal and cordial atmosphere, an exchange of gifts took place with mementos representing their respective jurisdictions. A press conference was held with the editor of the Archdiocesan press. His Beatitude articulated his thoughts on the need for strengthening and nurturing closer relationship between the Armenian Church and the Roman Catholic Church within the framework of ecumenical dialogue and cooperation. Later in The Catholic Review, an official publication for the region, an interview was published by the Review Associate Editor Mr. Christopher Gaul. The Patriarch-was quoted as saying: The model of Orthodox-Catholic unity is a patriarchal synod (council) which would be chaired by the pope himself as the chief patriarch. It would be a good way of governing, he said. I think Christological and theological differences can be resolved if there is good will and persistence. And he insisted that ecumenism needs to be an integral part of pastoral outreach at the parish level by Catholics and Orthodox alike and that people of everyday church need to be educated about the issues at stake in the quest for unity. The Review continued: Although separated for more than 1500 years, Catholics and Armenian Orthodox, one of the Oriental Orthodox churches, recognize the validity of each other's sacraments, including the priesthood and Eucharist, as well as the apostolic succession of their bishops. Before Patriarch Mesrob received the honorary degree at St. Mary's, Cardinal Keeler took him on a tour of Baltimore's historic Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The two stood together in front of the basilica's high altar in a manner reminiscent of the October 1999 visit to the basilica of Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople, the primary leader of the Orthodox Church worldwide. That event marked the first time an Orthodox leader of the patriarch's stature had prayed in a Roman Catholic Church in the United States, concluded the report. Just prior to the commencement exercise, His, Eminence Cardinal Keeler hosted a dinner attended by the faculty and the administration of the Seminary. In welcoming His Beatitude, the Cardinal underlined his achievements in fostering ecumenical dialogue involving Catholicism and churches of the East, Western European Protestantism, and the growing need for dialogue between Christianity and Islam. An impressive commencement exercises followed. In his acceptance remarks, His Beatitude said: Serving as the first ecumenical officer of the Armenian Patriarchal See of Istanbul for 19 years and the last 5 years as Patriarch, one grows into a natural appreciation of the worldwide Christian Church, and the need to relate to and to reconcile with Christians of other great traditions. The promotion of the Christian Unity, ecumenism, is no longer fashionable; it is rather an evangelical imperative and an inseparable part of our priestly vocation and ministry. The Armenian Patriarchal See of Istanbul and all Turkey has a profound record of martyria. From the foundational days of the historic city once called Byzantium, Constantinople, or New Rome, there was always a community of Armenians. The second and final translations of the Bible was achieved only after the Holy Translators visited the city in the 5th century and established the first settled community there. Later twelve emperors of Armenian descent reigned on the Byzantine throne from the 7th century onwards. The Armenian community had its first ordinary bishop during the Latin Kingdom of Constantinople. It was this bishopric that would be recognized by the Ottoman Sultan as a patriarchy in 1461, eight years after the conquest of the city. The See became the spiritual center for all Armenians living west of Mount Ararat. The first Armenian churches in Western Europe and North America were first planted by the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul, reaching a record of 54 archdioceses and over 200 monasteries just before the First World War. The tragic events during and after the war reduced the Armenian Patriarchate of Istanbul to the confines of the modern Republic of Turkey, and the dioceses in the West were consequently transferred under the jurisdiction of the Catholicos of Holy Etchmiadzin - the Presiding Patriarch-Catholicos of All Armenians. May I humbly accept this degree, the honor of which should go to the priests and people of my church community and to the 83 patriarchs before me who served in Istanbul and who have lived out our faith in Christ, sometimes under quite trying circumstances. I accept this degree thankfully as an encouragement to my efforts to promote Christian unity. A particular concern tome has been the fostering of inter-religious understanding with an emphasis on Christian-Muslim dialogue, and the much-needed dialogue between the Armenian and Turkish peoples. As His Holiness John Paul II has repeatedly affirmed, as Christians we believe that many difficulties and possible further clashes between civilizations and cultures can be avoided. The recipe is the evangelical vocation to love our neighbor and to engage in dialogue. Mankind, especially the young generation, needs hope and direction. Then His Beatitude, addressing the graduates, offered a moving spiritual message paraphrasing a few thoughts from the Book of St Gregory of Narek. He said: According to the mystic [St. Gregory], the human capacity for transformation, to make a transition from an imperfect to a perfect state, is quite possible...just as the saints have the capacity to overcome, so do men and women, by the grace of God...The mystic has the overwhelming impulse to speak and to reconnect with God at each step that he takes. Here is what he says in the 12th chapter of his prayer book: I long not so much for the gifts, but for the Giver. I yearn not so much for the glory, but for the Glorified! These words are the challenge to all of us who are in Christian service, be it with magisterial or Episcopal authority, he emphasized. And it is these words that I would like to present as a gift to the graduates of St. Mary's Seminary and University in Baltimore today, from a remote comer on the shores of Lake Van in the East, where the monastery of Narek no longer exists, but the prayers of the holy monk Gregory continue to echo in the whispers of silence. On the following day before his departure. His Beatitude met with old friends and colleagues at the Catholic Bishops Conference of USA, Washington, DC, visited the Library of Congress to develop an internet connection for the Patriarchal Library, and managed to visit informally at a luncheon with a few representatives of the St. Mary parish where he was cordially welcomed and everyone wished him bon voyage. His Beatitude's whirlwind of a visit for those three days left the Armenian community of Washington and Baltimore very proud indeed.

"BRIDGET Reuter's bags had already been cleared through customs and she was about to rush through U.S. immigration. She had flown into Ireland from the U.S. last November to serve as matron of honor at her niece's wedding, and was eager to return to her husband Dietrich in Texas, an U.S. Air Force veteran who had recently been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. She had to go through a routine paperwork check at Shannon Airport, something that someone married to a U.S. citizen for 33 years didn't feel she had to worry about. But then one of the officials inspected her passport. The woman who stopped me wasn't very friendly, if I can put it that way, Bridget says during a phone interview from Ireland, where she has been living with her 89-year-old mother since November. The woman took my photograph and my fingerprints. My suitcases had been let though and she had to run out and get them back. I had to identify my suitcases and then I was left by myself. U.S. immigration officials kept Bridget in Shannon for six hours before she was told that she was not allowed to return. I felt like I had committed murder or something, she recalls. I was dumbfounded. I didn't know whether I was going to have to spend the night in prison, I didn't know anything. I was very, very lucky to have a brother and his wife in Shannon - that's also where my niece's wedding took place. I stayed with my brother for a couple of weeks and then came up to my mother in Longford. Everybody was shocked to see me. The INS - now known as the BCIS, a division of the Department of Homeland Security - had approved Bridget Reuter for permanent residence, or a green card, in January 2001, after she paid $1,600 in processing fees. She hadn't felt it necessary to seek residency before, as the family had moved with Dietrich's job through his native New York to U.S. airbases in Europe. Their son, Richard, returned to New York, and later joined the military, settling in Lockhart, Texas, and they decided to join him there. The family believed all of Bridget's INS paperwork was in order when she left for Ireland, but she had not applied for the required advance parole permission to leave the U.S. while her status was being formally adjusted. In correspondence to her Congressman Ron Paul in March, Timothy Haugh, a BCIS official, warned that Bridget may have created severe consequences for herself and may be barred from the U.S. for 10 years for not having advance parole. Even though she was married to a U.S. citizen for 33 years, Bridget was still technically considered undocumented when she left for the wedding, and given the amount of time she had accrued in the U.S. without status, a mandatory 10-year bar from returning could by law be imposed. Richard Reuter has enlisted the aid of a New York immigration attorney, Jim O'Malley, to fight his mother's case, but if that fails he is considering moving his father from Texas to Ireland. Haugh also declined Richard's request that the attorney general's office grant his mother compassionate parole to reenter the U.S. Humanitarian parole cannot be used to circumvent normal visa-issuing procedures, Haugh's letter states. Parole is an extraordinary measure, sparingly used to bring an otherwise inadmissible alien into the United States for a temporary period. My request didn't even reach the attorney general's office, says Richard. It went straight to Homeland Security and they decided what the attorney general should do. There's something wrong with that. Bridget, 61, is still living with her mother seven moths later, with no husband, no income and no car. She is in very regular phone contact with her husband, Dietrich, who is partly deaf and uses headphones to hear her speak. A native New Yorker, Dietrich had moved with Bridget to Lockhart, Texas in 1999, to be close to their son, Richard. I miss her and want her home, but when you are dealing with Washington, everything is so slow, Richard says. I don't want to have to move to Ireland, but if we are left with no option, we will have to do something. Bridget spends her time in contact with her family, and with domestic chores. She has recently applied to the Irish state for social welfare, something she has never had to do before. I take a trip with my sister to Ballymahon village whenever my sister drops by, and I go sometimes to Longford town, but that's about it for travel, she says. I am very unhappy. I can't see my family and my son and my two little grandchildren, and I'm stuck here. She has contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs and received a letter from Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen informing her that he was investigating the circumstances. Neighbors and friends in Lockhart have raised $4,000 in the last week to cover legal expenses, after the Reuter family announced that it intends to fight the case in court. The local people here have been amazing, says Richard, who was stationed in Lockhart after spending most of his adult life in Coney Island, New York. I think the Homeland Security people are feeding us a lot of nonsense when they say that they have looked at all the possibilities. My father served his country for 35 years and it's like it never happened, he says. Richard is trying to keep his spirits up, and is staying up all night so he can go on an Irish radio program at 4 a.m. Texas time. He is joined by friends and neighbors who have volunteered to play Monopoly with him until his time to go on air has come. The family will take what publicity they can. My husband and my son have been trying very, very hard to get me back but nothing has been going right for them, says Bridget. I just want to get home to my own family, and see my grandchildren grow up. I don't think that's too much to ask. This is the second high profile advance parole case this year arising from the BCIS section in Shannon Airport. In March, U.S. District Judge James B. Moran strongly denounced immigration officials for revoking the advance parole of Chicago Muslim leader Sabri Samirah, who was refused entry to the U.S. at Shannon after visiting his seriously ill mother in Jordan. Judge Moran said that the Samirah case had a Gotcha! aspect to it that was demeaning to the U.S., and allowed Samirah a right to re-enter the U.S. to appeal the Homeland Security Department's decision. Last Sunday, Gay Mitchell, the foreign affairs spokesman for the Republic of Ireland's largest opposition party, Fine Gael, strongly criticized U.S. immigration policy at Irish airports, and said it is separating young people from their families. Young men and women traveling with their parents are being separated from the rest of their family and turned back, he said. Recently, a young woman who overstayed in the U.S. because of illness, which she can certify, was denied entry. This is far too severe. The U.S. is entitled to enforce its immigration policy, but surely a life sentence for a minor infraction in youth is over the top? Attorney O'Malley, a native of Limerick, agrees. A few years back an immigration officer may have taken pity on her and just let her pass through, he feels. But that's not happening anymore. It's all to do with the zero tolerance policy in place after September 11. Unfortunately, up to now the Reuters have been told what they cannot do, O'Malley continued. No one has told them what they can do, and that's what I'm going to work on now. Photograph (Dietrich and Bridget Reuter)","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2003-07-01,1
"THE CLARINET POLKA Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press 2002, 406 pp. $24.95 Jimmy Koprowski, narrator of the book has returned from Guam during the Vietnam War. He is disillusioned with life, his hometown and unable to adjust to the small town Polish American neighborhood where he grew up--Raysburg, West Virginia. He goes on drinking binges, swears, lies and thinks nothing of taking up with a married woman from the better part of town. A most disagreeable guy, heading down the wrong path. He hates the run-down mill town and wants to leave, to visit his Air Force buddy in Texas, but never makes it. He haphazardly works at a low-paying job his father found for him--when it doesn't interfere with his other occupations. He spends most of his time with his drinking buddies in the local saloon. But his sister, Linda, has faith in him, and urges him to go to church, to the church festivals, and get straightened out with his drinking. She decides to form an all-girl polka band with several zany characters and appoints Jimmy as manager. Janice, a terrific clarinetist, joins the band and Jimmy ends up driving her home after rehearsals. He is smitten by the girl, much younger than he. He feels the Polish American prodigy is from another world after meeting her parents. But they like him and don't object to Janice's long hours at Jimmy's home, practicing with the band. The working class section of South Raysburg has a Catholic church that has Mass in Polish, holds fund-raising events with fares of pierogi, golabki, kielbasa, and dances. As the band becomes more popular, Jimmy is driven between his desire to be near Janice and his destructive drinking binges. Polish history is introduced through Janice's father, Czeslaw, who had never revealed the horrors of war to his children. Instead he and his wife painted an idealist picture of Poland through Chopin, Mickiewicz, and Slowacki. When he finally does talk of their war experiences, at Janice's urging, it almost destroys the family. Jimmy comes to the rescue and realizes how much Janice means to him. He decides to reform his life and make himself worthy of Janice, and learns that the community is also routing for him. The Polish American community is portrayed so thoroughly it is difficult to believe Maillard isn't Polish. GO IN PEACE A Gift of Enduring Love Loyola Press, 2003 244 pp., $19.95 Durepos has provided a collection of Pope John Paul's words from his many talks and sermons in an effort to answer two questions--What does it mean to be a Catholic and Christian today, and Why do we believe as we do. John Paul has a powerful vision of what it means to be a Christian in our modern world and constantly urges everyone to live the faith. The twelve chapters explore themes that have dominated the Pope's writings since he assumed the papacy. Each of these--Faith and belief, prayer, Jesus, church, family, forgiveness and reconciliation, living in the world, morality and Christian conscience, suffering, Christian vocation and working in the world, God and Father, the Eucharist and the Mass--begins with scripture which refers to that chapter's theme. John Paul's words are soothing and encouraging. Included is a final blessing by Pope John Paul, and a biographical sketch. Scripture and quotations with each chapter, and sources are included. TO KILL THE POPE An Ecclesiastical Thriller Lisa Drew Books/Scribner. 2000, 317 pp., $25.00 Szulc has provided a fictional account of real events, fact and persons surrounding the attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul II on May 13, 1981. While it is known who made the attempt, the backing behind the person has never been proven. In this novel, the French and Italian investigators refused to pursue the investigation. The Vatican decides to continue the investigation secretly. The fictional Father Tim Savage, with a Ph.D. in Arabic and Islamic Studies, had been recruited by the CIA to serve in Cairo and later Vietnam. There he is disillusioned with the search and destroy methods of entire villages under the assassination program the U.S. government had established. He resigns and joins the Jesuits. He is soon placed in a fast track; the Jesuit hierarchy in Rome already marked him as a future Jesuit superstar. In Rome he works with the Commission on Religious Relations with Muslims. Eight years later he is asked to secretly investigate the assassination of Pope Gregory XVII. His only contact with the Vatican is Sister Angela, who distributes funds for his expenses. He searches for terrorist organizations in the Muslim world in Istanbul. His research and contacts lead him to believe that the plot to kill the Pope originated not in the Middle East, but very close to home. When he gets too close to those sources his own life is threatened. What makes the book relevant today is the information Szulc provides on the inner working of the Vatican, the mysterious deaths of prior popes, and the intrigue of past tragedies dividing the Latin and Greek Church. The truth about the investigation and assignation attempt against Pope John Paul II is disclosed for the first time. In order to protect Szulc's sources the fictional format was used. Szulc has worked as foreign and diplomatic correspondent for almost twenty years, and written many books, including Pope John Paul II: The Biography. POPE JOHN PAUL II: Reaching Out Across Borders, Prentice Hall, 2003, 184 pp., $29.95 As CEO of the oldest continuously-run institution in history, Pope Paul John is known world-wide. In his early years Karol Woytyla was an actor, then a slave to the Nazi regime. He studied for the priesthood in secret underground schools during World War II. In 1978 he became the first worker priest, the first Polish and first non-Italian pope since Adrian VI (1523). He has traveled the world, visited every continent and has been seen by more people than any other human being. This oversized book is full of black and white, and color photographs of Pope John Paul II taken by Reuters photographers during his long reign over the Catholic Church. An excellent history is provided by nine Reuters journalists, including Pullella and Storey. Journalist Phil Pullella, a Reuters correspondent for over 20 years and an authority on religious and Vatican affairs, has accompanied Pope John Paul on more than 70 foreign trips and dozens within Italy. He has provided many exclusive Vatican stories, as well as Italian politics, terrorism and culture for Reuters. David Storey, an expert in U.S. national affairs, has worked as a foreign correspondent throughout the world. In Poland he witnessed the electrifying effect Pope John Paul had in his fight against communism and rode ahead of the Pope in 1981, in one of the biggest human crowds in history when he again visited Poland. Photographs by over 30 Reuters photographers accompany the text with vivid pictures of the Pope's life, the Vatican and worshipers.

"In order to understand why it is taking so long for the Turks to build a European-style democracy, one has to be familiar with Kemalist ideology and its fundamental principles. In the beginning, Kemalist ideology was utilized by the founding fathers of the Turkish Republic as a means to create a uniform Turkish State out of the multiethnic Ottoman Empire. This decision was taken in January 1919 at the secret meeting of the Medjlis-I Mebusan (House of Deputies), and the concept of the idea of Misaki Milli (National Pact) referred to areas that were considered possible for the Turkish Nationalist Army to control, which essentially corresponds to the present boundaries of the Turkish Republic. Within these boundaries, Kemalist forces decided to establish a new state for Turkish-speaking Turks only. The leader of the Nationalist movement Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) was a very clever reform-minded revolutionary who, in a short time, managed to create powerful resistance forces to oppose British, French, Italian and Greek interventionists. He successfully forged cordial and mutually beneficial military and commercial ties with Bolshevik Russians. During the Turkish War of Independence (1918-23), he shrewdly combined diplomatic maneuvers and commercial incentives to split the British, French, and Italian interventionist coalition. He was able to enlist the support of pro-Turkish Westerners like U.S. Admiral Mark Bristol, U.S. intelligence agent Alien Duties and U.S. fact-finding commission member General James Harbord to his advantage. In the end, Greeks, Armenians and all their lukewarm Western supporters were defeated both in military and political arenas. The Treaty of Serves was preempted by the Treaty of Lausanne; the Greek and Armenian presence in Anatolia was totally eliminated; later the Kurdish nationalist movement was brutally crushed, and Turkey for Turks only became a reality. SIX PILLARS OF KEMALIST IDEOLOGY The Turkish House of Deputies, following the final victory over the enemy, elected Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) president of the newly established Turkish Republic on October 29, 1923 and the Ottoman Sultanate regime's six-century rule was brought to its abrupt end. Mustafa Kemal promptly established the Republican Party (Cumhurriyet Halk Partisi-CHP) as a political power base and formed People's Houses (Halk Evleri) to indoctrinate citizens with Kemalist ideology. The six pillars of Kemalist ideology are depicted in the Republican Party preamble, and in the flag with six arrows, which translates into 1) Republicanism. 2) Nationalism. 3) Populism. 4) Revolutionism. 5) Secularism. 6) Etatism (Statism). Each of those principles is jealously guarded by the Turkish military and enforced by government-appointed judges and state prosecutors. Ataturk and his co-ideologues, mostly members of the former Ittihadist Young Turks, consolidated their power and implemented the rigid and dogmatic Kemalist ideology. Kemalist ideas not only became part of the Constitution, but, down till the present, they remain immune of any criticism. Their fundamental principles cannot be the subject of any alteration, and this ideology continues to control the daily life of Turkish citizens. Any challenge against Kemalist ideology is not tolerated, and those who dare to criticize it can be subject to imprisonment and rather severe punishment. In hearings attendant to Turkey's ascendance to European Union membership, Western critics are finding Kemalist ideology a source of Turkish democracy's shortcomings. FEAR OF INTEGRITY BEING UNDERMINED The draft report of EU Commission member Arie Oostlander indicates that Kemalist ideology contains an exaggerated fear of the undermining of the integrity of the Turkish State, with an emphasis on the Homogeneity of Turkish Culture and Ethnicity. He asserts that, with these Nationalist slogans and rigid attitude toward religion, meaning intolerance to religious diversity, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, Turkey is prevented from implementing the basic principles of democracy; namely, respecting the rights of different ethnic and religious minorities. The Turkish concept of homogeneity translates into forceful assimilation of minorities or ethnic groups. In the case of Kurds, if they resist assimilation and openly identify with Kurdishness, they can be subject to harassment or persecution. For the past eight decades, Kemalist ideology was forced upon the citizens of Turkey by the Turkish through an array of arbitrary laws and articles unprecedented in any democratic society. Paragraph 5 of Preamble 4121.1, amended in 1995, states: No protection shall be given to thoughts or opinions that run counter to Turkish national interests, the fundamental principle of the existence of the indivisibility of the Turkish state and territory, the historical and moral values of Turkishness, or the nationalism, principles of reforms, and modernism of Ataturk, and, as required by the principle of secularism, there shall absolutely be no interference of sacred religious feeling in the affairs of state policy. This law is conveniently used against those political activists who advocate more freedom and democratization or permissiveness for ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity. They are all banished to the Turkish prison system. LANGUAGE AND PRESS RESTRICTIONS Article 26.3 states: No language prohibited by law shall be used in the expression and dissemination of thought. Any written or printed documents, phonograph records, magnetic or video tapes and other means of expression used in contravention of this provision shall be seized by a duly issued decision of a judge or, in cases where delay is deemed prejudicial, by the competent authority designated by law. This law is specifically designed against citizens of Kurdish extraction. The use of Kurdish names, the use of the Kurdish language in public, or in the production of Kurdish songs, films, videos or publications, is prohibited, and offenders are subject to persecution. Article 28.5 states: Anyone who writes or prints any news or articles which threaten the internal or external security of the state or indivisible integrity of the state with its territory and nation, which tend to incite offense, riot or insurrection, or which refer to classified state secrets, and anyone who prints or transmits such news or articles to others for the above purpose shall be held responsible under the law relevant to these offenses. This law is also used against Kurds, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, leftist dissidents or anyone who tries to write about the Armenian genocide, or advocates respect for Kurdish, Greek and Jewish rights or promotes leftist or ultra-rightist ideas. These individuals were subjected to investigation, harassment, fine, dismissal from work or imprisonment. Article 42.9 states: No language other than Turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to Turkish citizens in teaching and learning institutions. This law again targets Kurds and other minorities and discourages them from using their native tongue. DISCRIMINATION AGAINST MINORITIES Article 159 - Amended: 1961/235:- Those who publicly insult or ridicule the moral personality of Turkishness, the Republic, the Parliament, the Government, State Ministers, the Military or Security Forces of the State, or the Judiciary, will be punished with a penalty of no less than one year and no more than six years of maximum security imprisonment. Thousands of innocent political activists, dissidents, ethnic and human rights advocates were falsely charged under this law for defaming the State and its representatives. They all ended up in Turkish prisons and their lives were ruined. Under Parties Law-No 2820, adopted April 26, 1982 - Article 81 - Under the chapter on Preventing the Creation of Minorities - Political Parties: a) cannot put forward that minorities exist in the Turkish Republic based on national, religious, confessional, racial or language differences. B) cannot by means of protecting, developing, or disseminating language or cultures other than the Turkish language and culture, through creating minorities in the Republic of Turkey have the goal of destroying national unity or be engaged in activities to this end. C) Cannot use a language other than Turkish in writing and printing party statue or program, at congress, at meetings in open air or indoor-gatherings; at meetings, cannot use or distribute placards, pictures, phonograph records, voice and visual tapes brochures and statements written in a language other than Turkish; cannot remain indifferent to these actions and acts committed by others. This entire law is aimed to assimilate non-Turkish groups; it is also aimed at preventing them from assuming positions in the government, legislature, judiciary, military and academia. The Law concerning the founding and broadcast of television and radio - No. 3984, adopted April 13, 1994, states that The general goals and basic principles are Turkish national education and development of Turkish national culture. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL AT THE HEAD The list goes on and on. Kemalism officially remains the state ideology. The military cadets and military officers, politicians, leaders of political parties, academics, teachers, judges, prosecutors, religious and community leaders, scouts - they all pledge their allegiance to Kemalism. Ministry of Culture and Education, Ministry of Justice, Interior Ministry and Gendarme, Minister of Religious Affairs and Information Ministry, they all fall under supervision of National Security Council (MKG-Milli Guvenlik Konseyi), which is controlled by the Military Commanders of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Gendarmerie. All civil or government institutions with their sub-branches are required to make sure that the principles of Kemalism are implemented. This rigid government or military control over the learning centers, social and civic institutions or establishments, and, in fact, over the entire citizenry runs against the very principles of European-type democracy understanding, and the Controlled Turkish Democracy fails to meet the Copenhagen criteria. In its 6/19/03 issue, the Turkish daily Zaman (Time) gladly heralds the following proposed changes that the Turkish government was contemplating in order to satisfy European demands prior to Turkey's admittance to EU. From now on, foreign observers will be permitted to observe Turkish elections. Kurdish broadcasts on Turkish television and radio will become permissible (yet, so far Turks claim that they cannot find anyone that is willing to assume this job!). Kurds will be permitted to give Kurdish names to their offspring. Article 8, which, under the pretext of fighting against terrorism, gives the state the arbitrary power to charge anyone for advocating separatism, will be abolished. The mighty National Security Council representatives, their unduly presence in the Film, Music and Art Council will be terminated; until today, they were exercising their arbitrary power to censor any film, piece of music or art work, under the pretext of defending national security. This minor concession, which is considered basic under European democracy, reveals how primitive Turkish democracy is and how rigidly it is controlled by Kemalist forces. KEMALIST IDEOLOGY VS. EUROPEAN UNION This space is too small to go into depth and detail to fully describe all aspects of the Kemalist ideology and its followers' zeal, despotism and fanaticism. Those Armenians who are involved in Turkish-Armenian discussions should be familiar with this Kemalist ideology and its implications. Even average Muslim Turks are having difficulty dealing with an array of imposed taboos and restrictions that the ruling elite is forcing on its citizens. If you are Armenian, Greek, Kurd or a Jew, you have to be even more careful, to stay clear of any potential law breaking! In order to enter the EU, the Turks are being asked to satisfy the principles of the Copenhagen criteria. For this, Ankara was told to find ways to ease restrictions on Kurdish cultural rights, to lift the blockade against Armenia, to find solutions to historical problems, and to compromise on the Cyprus issue. Turks were also told to abandon outdated martial laws, which are not consistent with the rule of democracy. They were also told to eliminate Turkish military interference in judiciary and civilian affairs. It is imperative that Armenian lobbying organizations give impetus to proponents of the democratization process in Turkey and continue to lobby for recognition of the Armenian Genocide, restoration of Armenian ownership of Abandoned Lands and Properties and illegally confiscated bank accounts and holdings. They also should continue to lobby for the elimination of the Turkish blockade against Armenia, and to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia. After Turkey meets all those demands as discussed, its membership into the EU will be facilitated.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2003-06-28,1
"On the 88th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Prof. Vahakn Dadrian delivered a series of lectures in California to Armenian communities and American academic audiences alike. In Los Angeles he was invited by the Association of Istanbul Armenians to speak on the relationship between the unresolved historical Armenian Question and the World War I Armenian Genocide. He traced the decision of the Young Turk Ittihadists to eradicate the Armenians wholesale to the lingering Turkish-Armenian conflict that evolved through the second half of the nineteenth century, starting with the 1878 Berlin Peace Treaty and reaching its apex in the aftermath of the 1912 first Balkan War. The shattering military defeat, which the Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians, the former subject nationalities, inflicted upon the proud and glorious Ottoman army, shook the Turks to despair. The subsequent restructuring of the Central Committee of the Ittihadist Party led to the predominance of the three key architects of the Armenian Genocide, namely, Drs. Bahaeddin Shakir, Nazim, and Ziya Gökalp, the ideological guru of the party. These three men then set the stage for the initiation of the Armenian genocide. The capacity audience expressed its appreciation by prolonged applause. The next day, Dadrian lectured at the Ararat-Eskijian Museum on Reflections on the Armenian Genocide. Focusing on the factor of power relations, he analyzed the near-fatal consequences of Armenian vulnerability as a permanent feature of Armenian victimization through a series of pogroms, massive religious conversions, dislocations, and ongoing persecution throughout the centuries. He treated the factor of Armenian impotence as a critical element in its ultimate genocidal victimization, matched in importance only by the equally critical element of persistent Turkish impunity. He autographed his books at the end of the lecture. GOVERNOR DAVIS ATTENDS APRIL 24th LECTURE IN GLENDALE His next public lecture in L.A. was on April 24, when some 2,400 people had gathered at the huge Civic Auditorium in Glendale to commemorate the Genocide. Of these participants, 800 were students enrolled in local Armenian high schools, who, by special arrangement, were brought to the Auditorium, as well as Armenian students enrolled in colleges and universities of the area. The event was attended by local, national and federal officials led by The Honorable Gray Davis, the governor of the state of California, who for the first time in the history of such commemorations chose to personally attend and honor the Armenians on that sad and mournful occasion. Following the brief speeches by the Governor, Representative A. Schiff, the mayor of Glendale, state Senator J. Scott, among others. Prof. Dadrian was invited to deliver the keynote speech. He began his speech by declaring, A nation was executed in its ancestral territories, territories sanctified with the traditions of the oldest Christian church of the world and adorned with the monuments of a 3,000-year-old culture. He then indicated that the Armenian martyrs' last wish, in many cases, was not to be forgotten, but remembered. Dadrian then vowed to continue to embrace this wish as his calling while pursuing the task of documenting the Armenian Genocide for all generations to come. He emphasized the inordinate cruelties and viciousness with which the Armenian victims were massacred and destroyed. In this connection he identified the methods used to kill the victims by mutilation with the help of blunt instruments, by massive drowning operations on the Black Sea littoral, and the various tributaries of the Euphrates River, and by burning alive tens of thousands of victims. In that connection, he briefly dwelt on the holocaust of the Armenian population of Mush city and Mush Plain, the heart of historic Armenia. As evidenced by Ottoman-Turkish, German, and Armenian survivor accounts, some 80,000 to 90,000 Armenians of this region were burnt alive in stables, haylofts, and wooden houses, mostly by bloodthirsty Kurds. ON TO SAN FRANCISCO Prof. Dadrian then outlined some of the recent developments in the academic domain that promise to hasten the realization of two goals that are paramount for closure for the Armenians: the establishment of the indisputable truth of the Armenian Genocide in the widest circles of academe worldwide, and the parallel attainment of ultimate justice that still remains denied and, therefore, unfulfilled. As he descended the podium, he received a standing ovation from the entire audience. Reportedly, Senator Scott, the distinguished statesman, and holder of two Ph.D.'s, remarked after the speech that he had no idea of those horrendous details of the Armenian Genocide. Upon his arrival in San Francisco, Prof. Dadrian proceeded to the St. John Armenian Apostolic Church in Oakland, where a Symposium on the Armenian Genocide was organized by the AGBU. Attended by a broad spectrum of Armenians of the area, as well as by a group of Armenian students from UC-Berkeley, Univ. of San Francisco, and Stanford University, the conference dealt with several aspects of the Armenian Genocide. It started with a leading lecture by UC-Berkeley's Prof. Stephan Astourian, a rising star at that eminent campus whose discourse contained novel and very interesting research material on migration and demography in historic Armenia for the transformation in the 19th century to the advantage of the Muslim-Turkish population. The other participants were Drs. Barbara Merguerian, Suzanne Moranian, Prof. K. Bardakjian and Dr. Rita Kuyumjian. Prof. Vahakn Dadrian was the keynote speaker lecturing on the Problems Surrounding the Recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The following day, Sunday April 27, Dr. Kuyumjian held a seminar on Gomidas as a victim of the ravages of the Armenian Genocide, and autographed copies of her book. Prof. Dadrian's own numerous publications, which he also autographed, were all sold out at the Civic Auditorium commemoration in Los Angeles, and at the Istanbul Armenians lecture hall. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA - BERKELEY One of these lectures was delivered at the Berkeley campus of the University of California to an overflow audience of students and faculty. Among the latter was Professor Margaret L. Anderson of the History Department, who recently read a cogent paper at the University of Minnesota Workshop on the Armenian Genocide titled Talk About the Armenians: A German Story. After being introduced by Prof. Astourian, Prof. Dadrian made his presentation on the topic of The Armenian Genocide in the Light of Compelling Evidence. After offering his definition of genocide, he sketched the key elements of the Turkish denial, which he then rebutted to the point of invalidating them. His entire argument was based upon his twin theoretical constructs, namely, compelling evidence, and the inclusion-exclusion paradigm. He then reconstructed the Armenian Genocide in the light of such compelling evidence by discerning the four major determinants of the Armenian Genocide. They are, he said, 1. Premeditation, 2. Genocidal Intent, 3. The Organization of the Genocide, and 4. The Execution of the Genocide. At the end, he offered some generalizations about impunity as a factor in the resort to genocide by a perpetrator, about the decisive role of monolithic political parties in total control of the organs of a sovereign state, and about the manifold opportunities a global war can afford for the perpetrator. He concluded that, in the final analysis, genocide is a means to an end as it aims at transforming a more or less heterogeneous society into a more or less homogeneous society by purging from its body those ethnic elements the perpetrators deem to be alien and harmful. In this sense, concluded Prof. Dadrian, genocide is an instrument for ethno-social restructuring and, as such, it is, therefore, functional. THE TWO LECTURES AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY At the invitation of Prof. Norman Naimark, of Stanford's History Department, Prof. Dadrian delivered a lengthy lecture before a mixed audience of students, faculty and a small group of Armenians affiliated with Stanford as staff personnel. Unlike at his last lecture at Stanford some three years ago, this time no Turkish student ventured to disturb or disrupt the lecture by unnecessary interventions. Stanford, having a sizeable number of Turkish students, mostly in the fields of science and technology, and most of them supported by grants from the U.S. government, is rather well suited to exert a variety of pressures to discourage any public discussion on the Armenian Genocide. Prof. Naimark, who has shared with Prof. Dadrian a number of panels exploring the theme of genocide at various universities, including one in Utah, which they both shared with Samantha Power, the celebrated author of A Problem From Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, introduced Dadrian by citing the highlights of his academic career, describing him as the foremost scholar of the Armenian Genocide. Dadrian's lecture dealt with The Turkish Denial Syndrome and the Antidote of Compelling Evidence. There was extensive post-lecture discussion in the question-and-answer period. Perhaps the most significant of all these lectures was the one delivered at Stanford's renowned Law School. Attended mostly by students and faculty of that Law School, Dadrian's lecture dealt with the topic: The Armenian Genocide and International Law. He was introduced by Prof. Helen Stacy who outlined Prof. Dadrian's training in various fields, including international law. In that connection she made several references to Dadrian's two monographs published in the prestigious Yale Journal of International Law, both dealing with the Armenian Genocide. One of them explored it as a single case study, and the other treated it in comparison with the Jewish Holocaust. The former appeared as the lead article in the journal's vol. 14, no. 2 issue in 1989; the second one in the journal's vol. 23, no. 2 issue in 1998 (off-prints available from the Zoryan Institute). In connecting the Armenian Genocide with international law, Prof. Dadrian discussed the origins of the legal concept of crimes against humanity, tracing it to the Second Hague Convention of 1907 in the preamble of which Russian international law expert Mertens' principles of laws of humanity and dictates of public conscience were incorporated as new standards governing national and international relations. He then discussed the May 24, 1915 proclamation of the World War I Allies characterizing the wartime extermination of the Armenians as a crime against humanity, noting that these involved new massacres in the litany of massacres Ottoman Turks periodically perpetrated against the Armenians. This innovation was adopted by one of the Subcommissions of the Preliminary Paris Peace Congress dealing with Responsibilities and Sanctions. Ultimately, the new legal concept was adopted by the UN War Crimes Commission at the end of World War II, when that concept was codified and embedded in Article 6c of the Nuremberg Charter, which later became known as the Nuremberg Doctrine or the Nuremberg Principles. The principle of genocide was codified and incorporated in the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide where the act of destroying in whole or in part and with intent an ethnic, religious, or racial group is deemed to be genocide. STANFORD LAW JOURNAL TO PUBLISH THE LECTURE On the strength of the arguments advanced in his lecture. Prof. Dadrian has been requested to submit his lecture for publication in the renowned Stanford Journal of International Law, subsequent to his writing it as a formal paper with full citations, as required by law journals. (As usual, he had delivered his lecture without the help of any notes). This will be another milestone of accomplishment in the domain of international law, through which Prof. Dadrian has been trying to explore the legal dimensions of the Armenian Genocide among legal scholars and international law experts.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2003-06-07,1
"Hellenic Times Scholarship Fund WOW!!! What a night. Nick Katsoris and Margo Catsimatidis deserve a big round of applause for yet another job well done on our 12th annual Hellenic Times Scholarship Fund Gala. They helped bring more than 1,200 participants to the event and helped raise more than $100,000 in scholarships, which were awarded to 45 worthy young men and women on May 9. Next year, we hope to raise and distribute even more. On the second Friday of May each year, HTSF attracts the finest individuals from the entertainment industry and civic sector, people who genuinely believe in its mission to help young Greek Americans advance their higher education objectives. But high-profile personalities are not the only ones who make the event's success possible. I also want to thank everyone for coming, as well as everyone who contributed their time and money to this noble effort. On that note, be assured that I personally review the list of contributors, and to those of you who can contribute more, but have contributed less, I look forward to greater contributions next year so that you can help the cause even more. Our community's future, which depends on the education of its young people, is counting on you, and our young students deserve all the help they can get. Heightened Terror Alert As we quickly approach summer, we are once again sharply reminded of terrorist threats not only against our shores, but also against the rest of the civilized world. As this issue was going to press, al Quaeda was threatening to strike Boston, New York or Washington; Aiman al Zauachri, Osama bin Laden's deputy who has a $20 million bounty on his head, surfaced and called on Muslim fanatics throughout the world to attack the diplomatic missions and interests of the United States, Great Britain, Australia and Norway, and to make the ground under their feet hell; US intelligence intercepted electronic transmissions indicating that terrorist cells have been activated in North America and Western Europe; and, in view of the recent terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia and Morocco, the White House raised the national terrorist alert to its highest levels. Without a doubt, the risks to our way of life, the threat to all freedom-loving countries and peoples, remain ever present in this post-9/11 world, and we can not afford to let our guard down. President Bush should make it eminently clear to the leaders and governments of nations which harbor and sponsor terrorists that they will be held responsible for any acts which originate from their countries. May God keep America and her friends safe. Ellis Island Awards On May 17, I was privileged to attend yet another Ellis Island Medal of Honor Awards Gala. The blood in my veins was surging with pride due to strong Greek American representation at this splendid event, which rightly honors America's multi-ethnic mosaic. The Ellis Island Medal of Honor is one of only two medals recognized by BOTH the US Senate and House of Representatives (the other being the Congressional Medal of Honor), and out of 100 medals awarded at this year's Gala, almost 25 percent of those were awarded to people of Greek heritage. More to follow in our next issue, so stay tuned.","Catsimatidis, John A",Hellenic Times,2003-06-05,1
"BAGHDAD, Iraq - The streets are filled with litter and sewage. The shops are shuttered. Food is still scarce, and unemployment is rampant. Despite these and other problems faced by post-war Iraq, humanitarian assistance is starting to flow into the country, according to David Holdridge, Chief Operating Officer for International Orthodox Christian Charities (IOCC), who was in Iraq for five days recently. Baghdad has a tremendous humanitarian need, aggravated by the long weeks of bombing, and the lack of electricity and water, Mr. Holdridge said. I didn't have electricity the entire time I was there. There is very little food. Mr. Holdridge was in Iraq on April 24-29 to assess the needs and begin emergency relief distributions on behalf of IOCC, an official humanitarian aid agency of the Eastern Orthodox Churches in America. His mission took him to Baghdad and Mosul, where he met with Orthodox Christian leaders and interviewed members of their communities. Mr. Holdridge attended Holy Friday services at an Antiochian Orthodox church in Baghdad and Easter services at a 13th Century Orthodox church in Mosul. His 590-mile trip from Amman, Jordan to Baghdad was without incident. IOCC is assisting 1,000 Iraqi families with their food needs after a humanitarian relief convoy was dispensed to Iraq from Amman. IOCC will distribute 1,000 food parcels for Iraqi families in need as part of a 6-truck convoy organized by the Middle East Council of Churches and Action by Churches Together. IOCC is also expecting to set up offices in Baghdad and Mosul in the coming weeks and begin distributions of family food parcels, first-aid kits, stoves and cooking utensils, tents and mattresses, hygiene parcels, and water pumps. Such assistance will meet some of the most pressing needs in Iraq: hunger, malnutrition, lack of clean drinking water and transmission of infectious illnesses. Distributions of emergency food and medicine will be handled by local parishes and the Middle East Council of Churches, Mr. Holdridge said. They know who the neediest are in their communities, he said. It gets down to the individual families very quickly. Humanitarian relief supplies will be purchased in Iraq or in Jordan. During his aid-and-assessment mission, Mr. Holdridge met Father Younan Yagoob, an Orthodox priest in Baghdad. Father Younan is the shepherd of a small Antiochian Orthodox community in Baghdad which will partner with IOCC in its humanitarian mission to needy Iraqis of all ethnic and religious backgrounds. Father Younan has an abiding sense of peace and humor, Mr. Holdridge said. He drives a beat-up old car with a broken windshield and a motor which could die at any time. Even so, he insisted on driving me around Baghdad. He kept many families with him in the church during the bombing. Christians in Iraq constitute 3 percent of the population in this predominantly Muslim country. Most Christians in Iraq belong to the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church, while about 140,000 are orthodox Christians. Father Yagoob said some of the most pressing needs in his country include medicine, clothes for children and transportation. Thank you for your participation in lifting burdens from the people of this country, he told Mr. Holdridge. The neediest communities in Iraq include the Shiite Muslims of Saddam City, on the outskirts of Baghdad. It's just a great, sprawling city with a lot of overcrowding, trash lying everywhere and sewage in the streets, Mr. Holridge said. In response to the current crisis, IOCC is appealing for $1 million to provide emergency relief, life-saving medicines and medical supplies to suffering people in the Middle East. IOCC's parent body, the Standing Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas, is encouraging all Orthodox Christians to support IOCC's efforts in Iraq through prayer and giving.

"WASHINGTON, D.C. - Markos Kounalakis, Chairman of the Board of Internews Network, testified last month before the United States Congress about the role of independent media in the Muslim world. Appearing before the House Subcommittee on Foreign Operations in April, Mr. Kounalakis said, With the ongoing struggle to combat terrorism and the changing situation in Iraq, the importance of supporting indigenous open media in the Muslim world is more acute than ever. Media will be a significant factor in developing a culture of democracy and civil society there. As an example, he cited the Internews project, Reporting for Humanity, funded by a grant from the State Department. In Amman, Jordan Internews recently completed the first in series of journalism training programs in the region stressing accuracy and balance in reporting, even while the war raged next door in Iraq. The project combines technical assistance, production support and mechanisms for publishing articles in the mainstream Arab press. Mr. Kounalakis recommended that assistance for independent media be made a priority in post-war planning for Iraq, and suggested that the Subcommittee include international and Arab human rights and independent nongovernmental media organizations to develop open media throughout the Arab and Muslim world. He also discussed the role which local media can take in combating HIV/AIDS. He described the Internews Local Voices project in Kenya and Nigeria, funded by USAID, which trains, supports and equips local radio journalists, talk show hosts and disc jockeys to improve their coverage of HIV/AIDS. The media are in a unique position to foster a changed social environment in which AIDS is addressed in a spirit of openness and honesty - an environment which is supportive of AIDS prevention, care and treatment efforts, he said. Mr. Kounalakis is president and publisher of the Washington Monthly, which counts people such as Warren Buffett, Paul Krugman, Garry Trudeau, Molly Ivins, former President Bill Clinton, and the producers of 60 Minutes and The West Wing among its readers. He is a print and network broadcast journalist who covered the fall of the Soviet Union as well as the Soviet war in Afghanistan. He has written two books, Defying Gravity: The Making of Newton (Beyond Words Publishing, 1993) and Beyond Spin: The Power of Strategic Corporate Journalism (co-author, Jossey-Bass Publishers, 1999). Internews is a non-profit organization which fosters independent media in emerging democracies, produces innovative television and radio programming and Internet content, and uses the media to mediate conflict within and between countries.

"IT is further enacted that all and every person and persons that then were, or afterwards, should be reconciled or shall hold communion with the Church of Rome, or should profess the popish religion, or marry a papist, should be excluded and are made for ever incapable to inherit possess or enjoy the Crown... -British Act of Settlement 1701 This week, you will see the cheering crowds and the adulation surrounding the 50th anniversary in power of Queen Elizabeth, of the German house of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (better known to all as the Windsors) as Queen of Britain. She has ruled at a time when the above act still remains fully in force in Britain. Under its terms, no Catholic can ever ascend to the throne. If Prince William marries one he will be automatically excluded. Indeed, if any member of the Royal family marries a Jew, Muslim or Hindu, for instance, they also put themselves outside the pale. As Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster and top Catholic official in Britain has noted, It is clear that the act of succession does explicitly discriminate against Catholics. Such is the racist and discriminatory reality underlying the monarchy in Britain. You won't hear much about it in the carnival of celebration about Elizabeth's anniversary, though. But whether William is a heartthrob or Harry is really Charles' son or whether the Prince of Wales will ever marry Camilla should really be a secondary concern in a country which holds itself up as a beacon of democracy and equal rights. American news outlets could do a lot better by holding back on some of the gushing coverage and actually investigating what would be a criminal case in America, denying someone a position on the basis of religion and race. While we hear lots about the sectarian hatreds that run through Northern Ireland, there is precious little about the sectarian rules governing the head of state in Britain. I do not know of another country in the world, including the worst dictatorships, that by law bans people of a certain religion from assuming the position of head of state. It gets worse. The British Treason Felony Act of 1848 makes it an offense punishable by life imprisonment to advocate ending the monarchy, even by peaceful means as the London-based Guardian newspaper recently noted. Thus, if you stand up in Hyde Park Corner and profess a belief in the end of the British monarchy you can, under existing law, be jailed for life. The act remains fully in force on the statute book. When the Guardian took a case against the Treason Felony Act the attorney general quickly told the editor that if he pursued it, I cannot give you an assurance regarding whether or not a prosecution or other action will be taken (against you). You are asking me to take action which sanctions in advance conduct which may be criminal. So it remains a de facto law that if you challenge the right of an unelected monarchy to rule as head of state you can be sentenced to life in prison. It is somewhat akin to a law over here which would still sanction some part of slavery. British Prime Minister Tony Blair, that champion of human and civil rights in Iraq and elsewhere in the world, has been remarkably silent on this issue, despite efforts by some of his backbenchers to make new law. Indeed, he hardly seems to mind that Britons are not actually citizens of Britain at all, but subjects of Her Majesty of the House of Windsor. The local difficulty began in the late 1600's when the Jacobite King James showed signs of turning Catholic and enraged the staunchly Protestant ruling class. King William of Orange in Holland was dispatched and took care of James and his rag tag Irish army at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. Soon after the Hanovers were invited in to run the British side of things. Most spoke no English at all, but down through the centuries they and their cousins the Windsors, who officially came into being in 1917, have come to embody the very essence of the British nation. This is despite the fact that several Windsors were blatantly pro-Nazi, reclaiming their German roots during the Second World War. Can you only imagine the outcry in America if our president and political and legal system tried to uphold a law that no Catholics could become head of state no matter how talented? Perhaps it is time we sent a message to the British that the game is up, chaps, and it is high time you modernized. The primacy of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha nonsense doesn't cut it any more.

"In commemoration of the 88th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Turks, Naregatsi Art Institute held a tribute program dedicated to the Armenian martyrs at The Great Hall of Cooper Union in Manhattan on April 24, 2003. Various artists presented their work through different mediums, such as music and film, not only to remember the perseverance of the Armenian people, but also to represent its future hopes and dreams. Well-known jazz singer Datevik Hovanesian was among the long list of vocal and visual artists who shared their diverse talents with the over 250 attendees. Photographs, sculptures and paintings by Armenian artists, such as Ashot Avagyan, hung on the walls for guests to view before and after the performance portion. In addition, a standing ovation greeted 100-year-old Genocide survivor Hagop Asadourian, who was honored that evening with a plaque presented to him by Naregatsi Art Institute founder and producer, Nareg Haroutunian. Setting the tranquil yet powerful tone for the evening, the female a cappella trio Everlasting Music opened the musical program by singing the very appropriate tune of Nor Tsaghik by Naregatsi. The Yeghiazaryan sisters, aged 17, 15 and 12, formed their group in 1999. Armed with his acoustic guitar, Vahan Artsruni performed original music dedicated to the Genocide. Artsruni had written one of his songs, Aysorvah Yerguh (Today's Song), almost fifteen years ago, he explained, but it still held the same meaning today. Accompanied by jazz pianist Tigran Martikyan, Datevik Hovanesian took the stage after intermission to sing, most notably Hov Arek by Komitas. Known as The First Lady of Jazz in the former Soviet Union, she has performed in over 30 countries with her specialization in ethno-jazz music. Also adding to the musical portion of the evening were Arto Tunçboyaciyan, who, like Artsruni, performed his own original music, and Anoush Barclay, who closed the performance with Hayr Mer by Komitas. The showing of the film Desecration by Hawk Khatcherian proved that the aftermath of the Genocide continues to unfold even today through the vandalism and neglect of Armenian churches and khatchkars in Turkish and Azerbaijani-controlled Armenian lands. With a continuous soundtrack of traditional Armenian songs and hymns, and less than thirty seconds of dialogue, the film steadily moves through regions such as Van, Mush and Karabagh, and depicts the deplorable conditions of ancient Armenian religious venues. Some of the scenes showed an Armenian church in Mush turned into a home inhabited by a Muslim family, while another housed a gymnasium with a large Turkish flag. Sheep grazed in and around another church, while other monasteries and churches were filmed in various states of disrepair, or had graffiti written on them. The evening's honoree, Mr. Hagop Asadourian, poet, prose writer and musician, addressed his rapt audience by recounting his 39-day journey by foot from his village of Chomakhlou (near Caesaria) to Aleppo at the age of eleven during the deportations in 1915. With a clear voice he described his disbelief in seeing his village, where the same families had lived for hundreds of years, uprooted and abandoned in a matter of three hours. After having witnessed the death of everyone in his family during the march, he finally lost his mother to disease and famine, and had to bury her with the help of his friends. He fled to Jerusalem and was placed in an AGBU orphanage in 1918. Attendees mingled pre- and post-program, surrounded by the works of Arto Tchakmakchian (sculptor), Garen Bedrossian (painter), Bérge Zobian (photographer), Kevork Mourad (painter), Ashot Avagyan (painter), Hrair Hawk Khatcherian (photography) and Souren Tchakmaktchian (sketch artist). Some of the artists, such as Kevork Mourad, were present for the event. Mourad commented, For me, the best way in which to honor our martyrs is to honor all those who have suffered the inexplicable cruelty of man to man; to link the Armenian struggle for justice to the broader struggle for justice in a world that suffers so much from the isolation of one group from another, an isolation which so easily spawns hatred. When asked about his involvement with Naregatsi Art Institute, he said, I was one of the witnesses of the formation of the Naregatsi Art Institute, which often took shape around our dining table in the small studio I lived in with my wife for a couple of years when we first moved to New York. I have to say that, for me, the most meaningful aspects of the program were those that broadened the scope of our commemoration in a more general celebration of a common humanity. Briefly sharing his views with the audience at the close of the program, Nareg Haroutunian stated that demanding the truth was particularly important on this day [April 24] when it is discarded. He wished for the commemoration to take place through the spirit of the art and the artist. In another Naregatsi-sponsored event on Sunday, May 4, attendees listened to the voices of Everlasting Music, Vahan Artsruni and Anoush Barclay at St. Anne's Armenian Catholic Church in Manhattan. Everlasting Music opened the program, followed by Artsruni's music. Playing his guitar and singing both his original music and the works of Komitas, Artsruni was accompanied by the voice of Anoush Barclay, and the second guitar of Armen Meschian. Naregatsi Art Institute was founded in Spring 2000, and its mission is dedicated to promoting Armenian art and artists living in Armenia and the Diaspora.

"George Bournoutian is not only a college history professor but also a much sought-after lecturer and speaker, not to mention a prolific author. As such, he has not one, but many audiences. One audience consists of his primary students, who look forward to his stimulating lectures reflecting a multicultural or cross-cultural approach to the study of history. For the past several years, these are students enrolled in Iona College, where Bournoutian is senior professor of Middle Eastern and East European history. Then there are students at Rutgers University, where he is visiting professor of Armenian history. As a matter of fact, since receiving his Ph.D. in Armenian History from UCLA in 1976 - the first to do so - he has organized and taught the first Armenian history courses at NYU, University of Connecticut, Tufts University, Ramapo College and Glendale Community College. Columbia University completes the list of institutions where he has taught Armenian history. Another audience consists of students, members of academia, and the general public who take advantage of the opportunity to hear him speak as guest/visiting lecturer or moderator. Still another audience is primarily made up of members of the Armenian community and others with a general interest in Armenian history. They will always associate the name of Bournoutian with A Concise History of the Armenian People: Prehistory to the Present, which first came out in two volumes - Vol. I in 1993 and Vol. II in 1994. In short order, this work went through three printings, each of which has sold out. No sooner had the author come out with a revised, single volume edition of this most popular history (in 2002), when it too sold out; and those who weren't able to get a copy of it are now anxiously awaiting its second printing. There is yet another audience, too few in number as far as this reviewer is concerned, whose members recognize George Bournoutian as the foremost authority on Eastern Armenia from the 16th to the 19th centuries. Indeed, the extensive research he has conducted over the past thirty years on the Armenians in Iran and Transcaucasia from 1500 to 1840 has produced meticulously annotated translations and commentaries on a wide range of topics, which have been published in the following chronological order: Eastern Armenia in the Last Decades of Persian Rule, 1807-1828 (Los Angeles, 1982); The Khanate of Erevan under Qajar Rule 1795-1828 (New York, 1992); A History of Qarabagh (Karabagh): Annotated Translation of Mirza Jamal Javanshir's Tarikh-e Qarabagh (Costa Mesa, 1994); Russia and the Armenians of Transcaucasia, 1797-1889: A Documentary Record (Costa Mesa, 1998); The Chronicle of Abraham of Crete (Costa Mesa, 1998); Abraham of Erevan's History of the Wars 1721-1738 (Costa Mesa, 1999); Armenians and Russia 1626-1796: A Documentary Record (Costa Mesa, 2001) - the last three being the first three titles published in the Armenian Studies Series of Mazda Press. Now Bournoutian has come out with his eleventh book, and the fourth title in the aforementioned series: The Journal of Zak'aria of Agulis. Zak'aria (1630-ca. 1691) was a native of Agulis (in present-day Nakhichevan) and a merchant who traveled widely in the Ottoman and Persian empires. He also made one trip to Europe and traveled in Italy, Austria, Germany and Holland. The Journal is an important primary source on the history of Persia (Iran) and eastern Armenia in the second half of the seventeenth century. Although the work was published in Armenian and Russian some seven decades ago, it lacked serious annotation and commentary and has been unavailable for some time. This is the first English translation of the Journal. Bournoutian's comprehensive introduction (pp. 1-12) is followed by [Part I] [1647-1677] [Destinations and Distances] covers the latter in miles and leagues. While admittedly this makes for relatively tedious reading, it nevertheless elicits the reader's admiration for its sheer amount of detail and Zak'aria's persistence in recording the distances between all the places (he generally refers to them as stations) on his itineraries. [Part II], the main body (pp. 41-159), given the title [The Journal] (1647-1681) by Bournoutian, is a record of various business transactions, pilgrimages, renovation of churches, and the events of the Holy See of Ejmiatsin (Etchmiadzin). In addition, the actions of local Armenian religious and secular leaders, as well as the policy of the Muslim khans, are examined in detail. The Journal thus describes the general political and socioeconomic conditions in the khanates of Erevan and Nakhichevan in the reigns of Shah Abbas II (1642-66) and Shah Soleiman (1666-94) and during the rule of five different khans in the region. [Part III], [Family Chronology and Miscellany] (1647-1681), covering pp. 161178, contains a short genealogical tract of Zak'aria's family and other miscellaneous data, as well as seven maps and a couple of photos. Bournoutian's extensive Commentary (pp. 179-204), which not only details the purpose and value of Zak'aria's journal but also provides an overall historical context for it, an Appendix of additional lines added by various owners of the Journal in the 18th and 19th centuries (pp. 205210), a Glossary of Non-Armenian Terms (Arabic, Persian, Russian and Turkish) (pp. 211-223), Select Bibliography (pp. 225-228), and an Index (pp. 229-242) complete the contents of this gem. I refer to this volume as a gem, as much in the literal as the figurative sense. Just as light is reflected variously by the different facets of a gemstone, so are various aspects of Eastern Armenian life revealed through the eyes of Zak'aria of Agulis. Not just revealed but brought to life by virtue of Bournoutian's faithful translation, such that the reader feels transported back in time to the 17th century and transformed into Zak'aria's traveling companion. First, to the extent that Zak'aria can be said to typify the Armenian merchant class of his period, we can conclude that said merchants were not only astute businessmen but also devout worshipers and adherents to the Armenian Church. Zak'aria's humility becomes apparent right from the start when he characterizes himself as unworthy (p. 15). His belief in the omnipotence and omnipresence of God is expressed in such lines as God's will nurtured me,...By His will, I set out to learn the art of trade,...whenever God willed me to stop in a village, a city, or on a shabby road... (p. 16) Further evidence of this belief is furnished by such words as with God's help, I revised my notebook (p. 17); (to the reader) remember that you shall receive just recompense from God, when you are summoned on the Day of Judgement (p. 18); with God's help, I left Izmir,...with God's guidance, we sailed to Venice... (p. 24); and, finally, May the Divine Holy Spirit lead me wherever my route takes me (p. 41). Another proof of Zak'aria's devotion is his celebration of Easter, the Feast of the Transfiguration, the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, or the Feast of Theophany, whenever he had the chance, coupled with the observance of the Fast of the Nativity and the Fast of St. James [of Nisibis]. Still another proof is his building of St. Illuminator's Khor Virap and the church on top of it in 1669, together with his brother Paron Simon. Zak'aria writes: ...the pit had been filled up for a long time and the church on top of it was in ruins... He goes on to describe how, after the work was completed, a pilgrimage took place the following year, with many vardapets, bishops, and throngs of people, and blessed the pit. The church was constructed and blessed in September 1670 - three months before the death of Simon, who thus carried out his vow in the memory of his parents and to save his and their souls (pp. 87-90). Thus, some three hundred years would pass before Catholicos Vazken I, of blessed memory, launched the renovation of the Khor Virap complex, which became one of the primary pilgrimage sites for Armenians worldwide in 2001, when the 1700th anniversary of the adoption of Christianity as Armenia's state religion was celebrated. Second, one of the other merits of such a journal as Zak'aria's is its presentation of interesting tidbits of history that normally get lost in the shuffle in an overall historical account or, at best, may be referred to in footnotes. For example, we learn that Zak'aria's sisters were given Persian names (although Bournoutian mentions in a footnote that this was the case with many Armenian females in the Journal, he fails to give the reason why) (p. 15). We also learn that economic protectionism is not just a modern-day policy; it was practiced in Venice, albeit in primitive form, back in 1676, as evidenced by the order of the Doge of Venice to the local admiral to seize the two ships containing the 600 pastav of cloth, to unload it on the wharf and to burn it (p. 135). The Venetians' fear was that this cloth which belonged to another Armenian merchant from Agulis, New Julfans and the Jews, would end up in the land of the Ottomans and deal a major blow to the sale of their own cloth. Some of these tidbits will satisfy even the most demanding historical curiosity seeker. For example, the killing of chickens in Agulis, Isfahan and Erevan in 1677 occurred for the oddest reason imaginable (p. 137). On the following page, we learn that, in Tabriz the same year, a vardapet, quoting from a great Roman book in his sermon, stated that 19 million persons had been martyred for Christ, since His coming until then. This reader, for one, was surprised to learn that in the mid-to-late 1600's there was no vardapet, no one who could read well, and no proper church vessels in the nearby villages of Maragheh (near Tabriz). Furthermore, the Feast of the Theophany had not been celebrated as far back as the villagers could remember, so the celebration on January 6, 1678, was a first (p. 142). Still other tidbits include the beheading of a Qajar agha in 1679 for raping a woman (p. 146) and the earthquake that shook Erevan on June 4, 1679, killing 7,600 people (p. 147). We also learn that, on the Feast of the Theophany in Agulis in 1680, Muslim visitors took nothing from the Armenians but one plate of sweets and three cones of sugar (p. 151). Or consider this: the famine that struck Erevan in 1681 was so severe that the bread available there, although more expensive than anywhere else, was bread in name only; in reality, it was made of soil and dried dung! (p. 159). Finally, readers who have always wished for a prayer against predatory beasts will find one on p. 210. It is regrettable, however, that a gem of this quality did not get the expert finishing it deserves. Had a finer toothed comb or sieve been used, several errors in punctuation, spelling, grammar, spacing, diction, and order in index entries could have been detected and corrected before this book came off the press. The same goes for the few instances of awkward usage, cumbersome sentence structure, and rough translation found by this reviewer. Also, there are foreign-language (chiefly Armenian) titles of articles, journals and books, which lack English translation in brackets. However, these defects, which can readily be corrected prior to a second printing, do not fundamentally detract from the worthiness of this latest entry in Bournoutian's remarkable oeuvre.

"According to Turkish commentators, the only superpower, the US, is determined to control energy sources and transportation lines and, in order to maintain its influence, plans have been drafted to administratively reform several governments in the Middle East, and later in the Caucasus and Central Asia. The U.S. is planning to introduce a form of federal governmental structure in those regions, which are plagued by ethnic and religious strife, and political instability. The U.S. priority is to push the democratization process through the creation of a pluralistic society with wider participation of different ethnic and religious groups, in order to form legitimately elected governments. With this type of administrative reform, the U.S. is aiming to build democratic nations not fragmented by religious, inter-ethnic and separatist disputes, without altering the existing international boundaries. The U.S. believes that, through education, the democratization process, economic improvement and the elimination of warlords, strongman control over the economy and populace, peace, stability and prosperity will eventually come to these turbulent regions. These drafts, at least on the surface, reflect the goals and objectives of President Bush's administration. SKEPTICISM OVER US AIMS IN TURBULENT REGIONS However, skeptics argue otherwise. According to some Turkish and Arab critics, the present U.S. administration is controlled by religious fundamentalists, mainly WASPs (White Anglo-Saxon-Protestants), whose religious beliefs dictate that their orders have supremacy over other ethnic and religious groups and civilizations, and that they have the right to rule others. They consider Turks, Arabs, and Iranians, in particular, and many other similar subgroups inferior to them. Turkish commentators are invoking the statement attributed to Bush, to the effect that he had a revelation of divine power to execute justice in Iraq. According to the same Turkish and Arab critics, the U.S., in essence, is trying to control energy and energy transportation lines in order to establish its hegemony. For this, the U.S. is attempting to impose political changes in the region in order to exercise its control. Former President and Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel, known for his pro-American disposition, stated in his interview with Turkish Daily News on 04/16/03 that compliance with the UN Charter was power of law while the American-led war was law of power. He continued, With the Iraq war, the U.S. has started to implement the so-called Bush Doctrine - which was based on the notion of preemptive strike - with or without U.N. endorsement. Mr. Demirel continued, If all countries start to act in the same manner, the United Nations system would collapse, as such acts would contravene the purpose of the establishment of the UN, overseeing global peace. Yet, Mr. Demirel conveniently forgets that Turks invaded helpless Cyprus in 1974 under the pretext of a perceived threat to their national security. Until now, the Turkish occupation of Cyprus continues. Ankara used to be the staunch ally of the U.S., but now the Turks are wondering if this assumption is still valid. Turkish commentators, current and ex-officials, including influential politicians like Bulent Ecevit, Deniz Baykal, Suleyman Demirel, Sukru Elekdagh, and retired generals are directly or indirectly quoting from April 16, 2003 issue of the British newspaper Independent and raising the following questions: Where are the weapons of mass destruction? What about the alleged links to Al-Qaeda? Do Iraqis feel liberated? Is Ahmet Chalbi just a crooked U.S. stooge? Are Syria, Iran and North Korea next on the American hit-list? Are the rebuilding contracts going to White House cronies? On what side were deals made? Was the war legal? Will Kurds fight for statehood? TURKS FEEL LEFT OUT No matter what the critics say, taking into consideration that terrorists selected civilian targets on 9/11, the U.S. had to take these drastic military actions against those extremist forces who were waging war against the civilized world. Not only to eliminate further terrorism, but also to remind those co-sponsors that there are consequences and a price to pay, if further attacks are planned. Their egos bruised, the Turks are feeling left out from the club of coalition forces; they forgot altogether that this was a war on terrorism, not a war, as perceived by them, to carve out territories from Iraq. The paranoid Turks are unduly worried about the impromptu statement of Interim Governor General of Iraq, U.S. Retired General Jay Garner that Kirkuk is a Kurdish town. The Turks are outraged that General Garner was not sensitive to Turkish security concerns and that he was, in fact, antagonizing Ankara. The Turks are now are in a mood of panic, and are overreacting to every American move that they perceive to be a pro-Kurdish stance. To sum up the Turkish fear of having become marginalized and isolated, it is sufficient to quote the editor in chief of the Turkish Daily News, Ilnur Cevik, who believes, According to insiders, anti-Turkish sentiment in the U.S. Defense Department is running high. Mr. Cevik reports that the Pentagon may opt to virtually eliminate the U.S. military presence in Turkey and that it opposes Turkish companies even becoming subcontractors in Iraqi reconstruction projects; this is viewed with growing concern in Ankara as Turkish leaders are getting mixed signals from Washington about the future of Turkish-American ties. He continues, Some officials in Ankara say that, judging from the confusion in Iraq created by the Pentagon, they are concerned that the U.S. Defense Department has its own agenda and is set to punish Turkey for not allowing American troops to attack Iraq from its soil. TURKS' DEBT TO AMERICA Why not? America doesn't owe anything to them, but the Turks owe a lot to the Americans, including their independence and economic survival. If President Bush is ready to punish civilized countries like France and Germany, why should he remain indifferent to Turkish betrayal? Mr. Ilnur Celik is also worried that the Pentagon is planning to hit Turkey by reducing U.S. military presence. He continues, Pentagon analysts reportedly feel Incirlik Air Base, in southern Turkey, is no longer of vital importance to Washington. It is true that the U.S. military bombers, attack crafts, and AWACS have already been withdrawn from Turkish soil and redeployed elsewhere. There are many willing countries in the region, such as Romania, Bulgaria, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates, which are readily offering airbases to the U.S. Unlike the Turks, none of them are requiring astronomical amounts of financial aid and grants. In addition, having all of Iraq and Afghanistan under its control, why should Washington care about Turkish bases? ROOTS OF TURKISH ANTI-AMERICANISM Turkish anti-Americanism has deep roots in Turkish society. Most Turks don't appreciate what America has provided Turkey since 1950, including military protection against the former U.S.S.R. huge economic and military assistance, and transfer of technology. Yet, the Turks claim that American Protestant missionaries are infiltrating Turkish society, as they once did during the Ottoman period, when they instigated the Ottoman Christians, including Armenians and Greeks, against the Ottoman authorities. Considering Christian Armenians superior to Muslim Turks, the missionaries tried to create an Armenia on Ottoman territory. The Turks are convinced that the same Protestant fundamentalist groups (Turks refer to them as WASP) are trying to undermine Iraqi and Turkish unity by advocating autonomy or even independence to Kurds. The Turkish Daily News, in its April 25, 2003 issue, published another anti-American article entitled Oil in Iraq: The Byzantine Beginnings, Quest for Oil, written by Dr. Ferruh Demirmen. Therein he claims that Now that the American-led war against Iraq, with unmistakable underpinnings of an oil-driven strategy, is nearly over...It is timely to have a look at the early history of Iraq's oil development. Suffice it to say that the U.S. today is playing roughly the same role with respect to Iraqi oil riches that Britain did early last century. While accusing the Americans, the Turks aren't hiding their feelings that the oilfields of Kirkuk and Mosul rightfully belong to them, since Britain snatched these oilfields from them after conclusion of WWI. SENSITIVE OVER ARMENIAN AND KURDISH ISSUES The Turks are very oversensitive and paranoid when they are confronted with Armenian and Kurdish issues. They are very suspicious of U.S. intentions in Northern Iraq, where they believe Americans are in the process of granting Kurds autonomy within the proposed Iraqi Federative State. Ankara has made it very clear to Washington that they won't tolerate Kurdish control over oil-rich Kirkuk and Mosul. Despite Turkish denial, it was also reported that Turkish Intelligence agents are already infiltrated into Kurdish controlled Kirkuk and Mosul and are secretly arming Turkomans against the Kurds. Obviously frustrated with Ankara's aggressive behavior, the Bush administration is not in the mood to yield to Turkish threats. During his recent April 24 Remembrance Day statement, maybe Bush didn't use the word genocide, but he mentioned the mass killings and forced exile of countless Armenians in the final days of the Ottoman Empire, which is descriptive of the act of genocide. The Turkish reaction in the electronic and print news media was total denial and rebuttal of mass killings, that throughout Turkish history these kinds of massacres were never directed at any ethnic group, and these accusations have been fabricated by the enemies of the Turks. Thus, the Turks indirectly called the U.S. President a liar and spokesman for Turk bashers. Yet, President Bush was generous in applauding those Turks who, along with some Armenians, were conducting dialogue in the spirit of reconciliation. TURKISH MOVES INCOMPATIBLE WITH RECONCILIATION Official Turkish response to reconciliation efforts, so far, is not promising. In fact, recent Turkish measures against Armenians can be considered a slap in the face of those who are conducting reconciliation talks. The following actions by Turks are not compatible with any reconciliation: 1) Closure of the Holy Cross Armenian Seminary in Istanbul (Surp Khatch Tbrevank). 2) Introduction into Turkish elementary and high schools, as well as lyceums, newly edited history textbooks, where Turkish students are brainwashed with official Turkish propaganda that Armenians in the Ottoman Empire committed treachery, collaborated with the enemy and committed atrocities against Turks and Azeris. 3) Pressuring Turkish Christian. Patriarch Mesrop Mutafyan to deny that there are any religious, cultural or administrative restrictions against Turkish Christians in Istanbul or elsewhere, which is untrue and contrary to the prevailing realities 4) Continuing anti-Armenian propaganda on government-controlled State Television, where panelists keep repeating the same lies that Armenians betrayed the Ottoman State, rebelled and collaborated with the enemy and massacred innocent Muslims. During an interview on the official TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) program, speakers on April 25, 2003 made it very clear that the Tiny Armenia that exists in the Caucasus was artificially created by Russia to advance Russia's interests, and is completely isolated by pro-Turkish Azerbaijan and Georgia, with no future and doomed to fail. This type of venom and anti-Armenian broadcast by official Turkish Television should make Armenian participants in Armeno-Turkish reconciliation very weary, that what they are facing are determined revisionists and deniers who are totally committed to burying the Armenian issue and force it into oblivion once and for all. 5) Turks continue to hold Istanbul Armenians as hostages to Turkish foreign policy aims, just keeping them alive so they will be able to tell the whole world that Armenians are still living in Turkey, while making it very difficult for them to maintain their Armenian culture, language and heritage, in order to accelerate the assimilation process. 6) Continuously destroying the remnants of historical Armenian churches, monuments and cemeteries even today, in order to be able to tell the whole world one-day that Armenians never lived in these regions. 7) Continuation of the anti-Armenian policy in the Caucasus, by not only arming Azeris, but also establishing Turkish military bases in Georgia, in order to complete the encirclement and obliteration of Armenia. Those Armenian critics, who are advocating rapprochement with Turkey while curtailing Armenia's link to Russia, are either dreamers or out of touch with current realities. Opponents of these assessments have to closely study official Turkish publications, statements, news coverage and declarations in depth, before claiming otherwise by reaching hasty and unfounded conclusions. Turkish aims remain the same: to weaken and obliterate Armenia, to deny Armenian History and Genocide, and to avoid any kind of responsibility arising from the act of the Genocide.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2003-05-10,1
"HERE'S a great story which came across the Associated Press newswires last week. An Irish pub, fully stocked, opened in downtown Kabul on St. Patrick's Day, and it is a huge success with the many foreigners who now populate the capital of Afghanistan. There are even Irish bartenders called Paddy, Kevin, Jimmy, Michael and George, but they are all Afghan staff, given Irish nicknames to add to the ambiance. The bar is simply called the Irish Club and it was the brainchild of Irish immigrant Sean Martin McQuade. In a totally Muslim country where alcohol is banned, the owner has to be careful. We wanted to keep a low profile so we didn't advertise whatsoever, McQuade said, but people know where to find us. News travels fast by word of mouth. There is no sign outside, or even a number on the door. The pub is in a mock Tudor style house behind a blank wall. Afghan waiters serve beer for $2 and cocktails for $3. The patrons are mainly aid workers diplomats and journalists. Ads for Guinness are all over the walls, and there is green marble on the floor imported from Ireland. A neighborhood mullah gave permission for the club to open, and in return McQuade promised to fix potholes on the road outside. Several soldiers patrol, paid for by McQuade to ensure there is no attempt to attack the premises. As one businessman interviewed noted, You could be anywhere, Ireland, Australia, America, but walk outside and you're back in Afghanistan. Sure sounds like fun.",NA,Irish Voice,2003-04-29,1
"CECILIA Hussein is in a jovial mood. A sister of Irish showjumping star, Captain John Ledingham, she is expecting a visit from the FBI at her Oklahoma home. I won't have much to say, she says with a laugh. I might have some work for them to do around the house. The FBI are arriving for a voluntary interview with her husband, Dr. Khadar Hussein, whose family history is a long way from her showjumping and farming background in Co. Waterford. Two of Dr. Hussein's brothers are in Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party - one is a general in Baghdad, the other is Saddam's chief organizer in the West Bank, charged with paying out money to martyrs' families and whipping up support for the Iraqi regime. A former Palestinian refugee and a one-time Arab nationalist, Dr. Hussein has grown bitterly disillusioned with politics, having seen the idealism of his youth distorted by a vicious cabal of dictators in Syria, Libya and Iraq. At the same time, he loves his brother in Baghdad and has a duty to protect his children should he be killed fighting U.S forces. He and his Irish wife Cecilia share a name with a dictator they despise, and find themselves at the center of a huge vortex of conflicting interests. Their oldest son, named after Khadar's father, is a lieutenant in the U.S. National Guard and may be called to serve in Iraq. They are shipping them out left right and center, says Cecelia. I know lots of families around here whose sons have been sent to Iraq. The family remains strongly pro-American but Dr. Hussein, a registered Democrat, voted for both Bush presidents, a decision he now regrets. He must also think of his other brothers and sisters in the West Bank and Jordan, and worries that his nonsensical war could spread to a wider conflict. Cecilia, too, is totally opposed to the war, yet supports the U.S. troops now that they are in Iraq. We have to show them support now that they are there, they rely on us for confidence. We are all hoping that it doesn't go on for a long time, she says. Living in a town as conservative as Oklahoma with a name like Hussein has brought its own problems. We're been around that track so many times before it hardly matters anymore, says Cecilia. It was difficult when the boys were in school. There was the Iran-Iraq war, which dragged on for a long time, and then we had it again during the Gulf War and now again with the Iraq war. If people say anything about my name, I say, `Would it make any difference if my name was Bush?' To honor both sides of the family, their two sons are named James and Khalid Hussein, named after Khadar and Cecilia's fathers. They married in Saudi Arabia 33 years ago after Cecilia moved from Ireland to work as a midwife for an oil company, just as the energy boom was about to take off. Her family didn't object to the marriage, and the couple visited relations in Youghal and Damascus before making their way to America. It was a dangerous thing for a man to marry a non-Muslim woman at that time, and a judge in Saudi gave me a hard time before he allowed it, remembers Dr. Hussein. My basic argument to him was that the Koran was the constitution of Saudi Arabia and there was nothing in the Koran to say I could not marry a non-Muslim woman. The judge agreed with me a lot of arguing back and forth. I don't know if that would be possible now. Khadar was born in a part of Palestine that was brought into the new Israeli state in 1948. The ensuing war with Arab states left his family scrambling for safety in caves, where children were ravished by disease and malnutrition. He won one of only 50 scholarships provided by the UN and learned medicine, eventually making his way to work for the same oil company in Saudi Arabia as Cecilia. They saved up money to get married and found their home in America, with a thriving oncology practice, a swimming pool and a generous suburban house. And now, more than three decades after their marriage, they find the FBI coming to call. It's nothing to worry about, says Khadar with a smile. I can look them in the eye and say that I am a proud American with an American passport. I love my neighbors and the people around me. I can tell them that this should be the American way, not the America of George W. Bush.","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2003-04-15,1
"There is a quatrain of Nostradamus that clearly points to three conflicts occurring in the areas of Arabia/Kuwait, Eastern Turkey (ancient Armenia) and Iran/Kurdistan. The first one already came to pass in 1991 in what came be to known as Operation Desert Storm. The second one we are witnessing now: Operation Iraqi Freedom. And the third one is for the near future (some few years from now) when, this time, Iran will be involved also. The Quatrain in question is No. 31 from the Century No. 3. It states: On the fields of Iran (Media), of Arabia, and Armenia (ancient Armenia, present-day eastern Turkey), two great armies will assemble three times. Near the river Araks (located in Eastern Turkey and modern Armenia), the host of the great Suleyman (the Turks) will be cut off. Suleyman is a reference to the Turks because the most famous Turkish leader, a contemporary of Nostradamus, was Suleyman II the Magnificent. The first two lines of Quatrain No. 27, Century No. 5, state: By firepower of armies, not far from the Black Sea. He will come from Iran to occupy Trebizond (a strategic city in Eastern Turkey on the shores of the Black Sea). The He in this quatrain is the Anti-Christ of the Middle East. Quatrain No. 54, Century No. 5, states: From the Black Sea and the great Tartary, a would-be king (a leader) will come to see Gaul (an ancient name for a region in Eastern Turkey). He will transpire Alania (an ancient name for the lands of Alans in north Caucasus, near modern Chechnya) and Armenia: and in Byzantium (Istanbul) will leave his bloody standard. This quatrain is a clear indication of Russian involvement also. Presently we are seeing a dramatic rise in anti-American sentiments in Russia as the result of Operation Iraqi Freedom. A paragraph from Nostradamus' prophetic Letter To The King (on page XI of my book) states: And it will seem that the way the nations are weakened by the Orientals that God the creator has loosed Satan out of his infernal prison in order to give birth to the great Dog and Doham. Nostradamus' original French-worded Dog et Doham was a mystery up until now when a Turkish Islamist leader came to power in Turkey by the name of Erdogan, Is this just a coincidence? Is the child of Satan in our midst now? In a March 23, 2003 nationwide television address, Erdogan said: The heroic Turkish Armed Forces, the guarantor of peace at all places and at all times, will once again extend their hand to those in need of help. What hypocrisy! What lies! What deception! Can he tell this to the faces of the Cypriots, Kurds, and Armenians? Since World War I, the Turks have not engaged in any conflict worth mentioning. As to their trustworthiness, the USA learned it lately the hard way when American troops were refused passage to Iraq by the easy way of Turkey. Obviously we are in the period of 27 years of war (which started on 9/11) prophesied by Nostradamus in his Quatrain No. 77, Century No. 8. That quatrain states: Very soon the Anti-Christ [Spirit who will possess a leader] will destroy three. His war will last for twenty-seven bloody years. The dissenters are put to death, taken prisoners and are exiled. Blood, human corpses, water reddened, earth ravaged by hail. Nostradamus' Letter To the King is a very intriguing prophetic epistle written in 1558. The following four paragraphs from that letter (in page XII of my book) are about the soon coming inevitable series of wars in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe that are going to be recorded by history as WWIII. World War III is possibly to start in earnest after few years when Operation Iraqi Freedom is over. I would like to label the upcoming war: Operation Armageddon. The first paragraph (this already came to pass in the recent war in Afghanistan. The Oriental Chief in it is a reference to the infamous Bin Laden): And it will come to pass then that because of the principle Oriental chief, the world will be stirred by the Northerners and Westerners; and most of the Orientals will be vanquished and put to death and overwhelmed and the rest will flee. [The surviving followers of the Oriental Arab chief will be imprisoned. The second paragraph (this is about a coming Muslim military invasion in north Africa all the way to southern Spain; into Andalusia, under the leadership of Bin Laden): What great oppression will then fall upon those rulers of countries, specially the maritime and Oriental ones. Their tongues intermingled in a great society: the language of the Italians, and of the Arabs via north Africa. Paragraphs three and four (the Troika/Triumvirate mentioned is a reference to USA, Britain, and Australia or To Bush, Blair, and Aznar): And all these Oriental rulers will be chased, overthrown and exterminated, not only by means of the forces of the Northern rulers, near the end of the age, [but] through three secretly united in pursuit of death and ambush, laying one scheme after another. This renewed Triumvirate will last for seven years, and the renown of this sect (the Christian Alliance) will extend throughout the globe. The [Christian] sacrifice of the holy and [the Christian] immaculate host will be sustained. And it will make so great a noise and bellicose tumult that all the Orient will tremble of the fury of those two brothers (two allies) yet not Northern brothers [in flesh]. It is worthy of mention that in Nostradamus' time the Orient was also referred to as the Middle East and Orientals as its Moslem inhabitants. Further references to Bin Laden by Nostradamus are made in Quatrain 69, Century 5: No longer the great one (a reference to Bin Laden) will be in false sleep. His solicitude (or his hiding) will come to an end. Raising an army of gold, azure and vermilion, he will subjugate Africa and eat it up to its bone. Quatrain 55, Century 5 is another reference to Bin Laden: From the land of felix Arabia, the strong one of the Islamic law is born. He will vex Spain and conquer Granada, then the Ligurian people by the sea. Bin Laden is going to be killed in a battle near Genoa, the capital of Liguria in Italy. Presently what we are seeing in the Operation Iraqi Freedom is the drying of the great river Euphrates so that the way might be prepared for the kings from the east. Nostradamus referred to those kings in his prophetic Letter To The King, quoted in page IX of my book, by stating: Then the great Empire of the Anti-Christ will begin in the Attila and Xerxes (this is the famous Iranian ancient king who almost conquered Greece. Expect a modern Xerxes arising in Iran soon. Attila could be a reference to modern China), and descend with great and countless numbers. Accordingly, the coming of the Holy Spirit (a reference to a Christian leader guided by the Holy Spirit) proceeding from the 48th degree [parallel] will make a transmigration, chasing out the abomination of the Anti Christ. The future is fluid and is subject to change. Hence, no guarantee is implied or should be inferred regarding the predictive validity of the prophecies of Nostradamus or its interpretations. However, I would like to quote a reviewer of my work who said: With global conflicts shaping up as they are, the signs and scenarios given in the quatrains [of my book] now seem more realistic and plausible as the weeks go by. Indeed, if the love and awareness bring to these times can affect our circumstances and surroundings for the better, then our fate as individuals and nations is by no means sealed.","Manuelian, Jack",Armenian Reporter International,2003-04-05,1
"DAMIEN Lynch, an Irish undocumented worker living in San Francisco, fell foul of the new terrorism provisions last week and was lucky to escape without a lengthy incarceration. His story is related in the current issue of the Irish Herald in San Francisco and written by that paper's editor Sean Canniffe. It is a fine piece of journalism. Given what happened to Bernadette Devlin McAliskey last week, when she was turned back in Chicago, it is obvious that the INS are cracking down not just on suspected terrorists from Muslim countries, but right across the spectrum, and netting many innocent people in the process. Lynch and his brother Brendan showed up at San Francisco Airport to meet a friend coming from Belfast on vacation. Their friend Gerry McConville had a minor conviction at age 16 of being a member of the IRA. McConville's past set alarm bells ringing at the airport, and right after landing the pilot informed all passengers that there was a top security alert and that they were to stay in their seats. Immigration officials then boarded and detained McConville. He was surrounded and led away in handcuffs for interrogation. Meanwhile, the Lynch brothers waited outside, oblivious to what had happened. The INS, however, soon located and arrested them too. All three were quickly taken to the city jail. It was there that Damien Lynch, ironically the only one of the three with no IRA background at all, went through his nightmarish experience. McConville was kept overnight in the jail and was told he was being deported because of his juvenile conviction of IRA membership. When he was placed on board the plane the next day the pilot refused to take him unless he was shackled and guarded the entire journey, even though he was not under arrest. He was returned to jail and flew out the next day. Brendan Lynch was also immediately deported. He had entered the U.S. with a false passport and INS did not pick up the fact that the passport was bogus. He was deported to London and arrested there by police and held for two days before being allowed to return to Belfast. Damien Lynch decided to fight deportation, hoping to get a chance to stay legally in the U.S. It was a long shot and it almost cost him his freedom. After 10 days in jail he finally got a bail hearing. At that hearing, the deputy district counsel for the INS, Patricia Spalleta, announced to the judge that the case was now part of an ongoing investigation and that it involved matters affecting national security, and that the judge was not qualified to adjudicate the case. The judge disagreed and said that he retained the right to deport Lynch. On Tuesday morning, as Lynch waited in the dock for the confirmation of his deportation, it became evident that the paperwork had not arrived and that the INS was conducting a rearguard offensive to keep Lynch for at least another 10 days, even though he was not charged with anything and they knew he had no record in Ireland. Despite the best efforts by the INS to detain Lynch, however, the judge was luckily swayed by the argument of Lynch's attorney, Jim Byrne, that he should not be held. Spalleta made it clear that she was angling to use the new laws which allow secret evidence and for a person to be held without charge. Lynch was strip searched several times and kept in handcuffs throughout his 10-day ordeal before he was finally deported. Meanwhile, back in Northern Ireland, his family home was searched and British papers ran a story that a major arms smuggling operation from the U.S. had been foiled. In the event no one was arrested and nothing was found. It is sad to note that in John Ashcroft's America every foreign suspect is deemed more likely to be guilty than innocent. Damien Lynch was lucky, he had a good lawyer and the Irish Consulate in San Francisco was aware of his case. We can only imagine how many other innocent souls in recent times, however, have found themselves incarcerated without trial on alleged secret evidence. It would make you weep for the wanton loss of the civil liberties that have made this country great. The great irony, of course, is that if the INS did their job pre-September 11 most of the hijackers would have been arrested and deported.

"U.S. IMMIGRATION officials in Shannon, Co. Clare unfairly blocked a Muslim leader from returning to the U.S. where he had lived for 15 years, a lawsuit lodged in Chicago has claimed. Sabri Ibrahim Samirah was put in prison in Ireland last September after the U.S. government stopped him from taking a flight from Shannon to Chicago. The Irish government also denied him a visa to stay in the country while he dealt with U.S. immigration officials. The U.S. Homeland Security Department says they suspect Samirah is a threat to national security, a charge he strongly rejects. His lawyer, Mark Flessner, claims in the lawsuit that Samirah was tricked into leaving the United States and was then blocked from reentering at Shannon. He also claimed that Samirah was denied a fair hearing at Shannon and had been unjustly blocked from returning to his family in Chicago. Samirah, the president of the United Muslim Americans Association, has begun a legal claim in a district court in Chicago, alleging that INS officials in Shannon were in violation of INS regulations and the Constitution of the United States but not providing Samirah with a hearing before an immigration judge. The papers, lodged by Flessner, also claim that Samirah was not notified of or given an opportunity to respond to any information that the INS relied upon to summarily revoke his parole and deny him entry into the United States. The lawsuit also stays that Samirah was stuck in Ireland without an Irish visa and was forced to wait in jail until the next flight back to Jordan, where he had visited his mother, who was suffering a serious illness. Samirah had applied for a permanent resident visa and granted an advance parole to visit his mother in Jordan last September. The lawsuit said that when Samirah passed through an INS check-point in Shannon, he was presented with a letter from Brian Perryman, District Director of the Chicago INS, informing him that his advance parole had been revoked. INS officials informed Mr. Samirah that he would not be allowed to enter the United States to be with his family or retrieve his belongings, he lawsuit adds. Flessner said that he had every confidence that a court would see that Samirah had been treated unfairly. This is a family man, a man of peace who loves the entire community. He is not a threat to anyone, he said.","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2003-03-11,1
"This past week, some apparent good news broke about TARC and the International Center for Transitional Justice (ITCJ). The latter decided that the Armenian Genocide, by legal opinion, conforms to the UN Genocide Convention. I am continuing research on TARC but, until I feel more comfortable about some unanswered questions, I will restrain from making any further public declarations. Instead, I will comment on matters that are of immediate importance to Armenia and Armenians and about which I have firmer knowledge. Azerbaijan had better be careful. Its terrorist affiliations are beginning to show. It is often the case that wayward nations transform their own misdeeds onto a competitor group to deflect the reality from home. We have all studied about the transference phenomenon in Psychology 101. The Nazis and the leaders of the Soviet Union used the ploy. Now Turkey's wannabe clone, Azerbaijan, is following suit. The press is continually barraged with accusations from Baku and Ankara about terrorist Armenians and how and where Armenia has allowed the PKK (now called the Freedom and Democracy Congress of Kurdistan or KADEK) to organize training camps in Armenia. Do not let the change in name fool you. Unfortunately for the Kurdish people, their leaders embrace neither democracy nor freedom. RIDICULOUS CHARGES In a previous article I wrote about one place where Kurds are supposedly training near Lake Sevan, Armenia. My wife and I had lunch on the exact spot where killers are alleged to sharpen their skills. We did not see any camp, training ground, or anyone we could identify as being a Kurd. The waiter laughed when I mentioned the accusations. The bandleader chuckled when I asked him the same question at a break. I really felt silly. Now, Ankara and their wannabe clones from Baku insist that the activities have been moved to Karabagh. No specific location in Karabagh was mentioned so I have not gone on a fruitless search. They also charge that Armenia is contaminating Karabagh by burying nuclear waste there, ostensibly for the day when the area is returned to Azerbaijan. The charges have been shown to be ridiculous. But something novel has surfaced. To my knowledge, it is a first for a Turk. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, leader of the governing Justice and Development Party in Turkey and the probable next Prime Minister if the generals allow him to take that office, recently pointed at Azerbaijan as the PKK haven. He publicly stated, Cells of the terrorist organization PKK continue to function in Azerbaijan and continue to develop under the cover of various cultural organizations. And he made the comments during a visit to Azerbaijan. He even hinted that the authorities in Baku were not taking actions to stamp out the terrorists. The information about terrorists being in Azerbaijan should not have been a surprise to anyone, not even to the folks with blinders on in the Pentagon, sitting at the Caucasus desk. Even the citizens in Azerbaijan knew of the existence of terrorists as early as the active shooting war against Armenians over Karabagh, when the Afghan and Pakistani terrorists joined their Muslim buddies. About five months ago, one of the opposition newspapers in Baku wrote an article about terrorists operating freely in Azerbaijan. The reaction from the government-controlled papers was that terrorists never existed in Azerbaijan, and then the same article stated that 33 of them had been captured. This is logic that would even dumbfound the likes of Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, the masters at scrabble talk. ADMITS POSSIBILITY OF TERRORISTS On January 15, Azerbaijan Interior Minister Ramil Usubov stated that it is possible that terrorist organizations were operating from his country and masquerading as cultural and charitable organizations. Mr. Usubov agreed that the PKK, for one, had changed its name but that it was indeed the same terrorist organization. He commented that such organizations are capable of operating out of any country. That is, of course, unless they come from Armenia. Then it is only proper to label Armenia and all Armenians terrorists. What Mr. Usubov feared is that some people might actually believe that there were tens of thousands of terrorists operating from Azerbaijan. Is it possible that tens of thousands of terrorists are operating from Azerbaijan? Absolutely. Why isn't it believable that Chechen, Afghan, PKK and Pakistani terrorists have training bases located in the wide expanse outside of the Baku environs? All but the PKK contributed to the forces that warred against the Armenians. The leaders of the Chechens and the President of Pakistan have vowed to help their Moslem brethren regain Karabagh by force. It has been reported that numerous Mujahaddein did not return to Afghanistan. It certainly is more likely that Moslem terrorists would feel a greater sense of security in Azerbaijan than in Christian Armenia. Especially since Azeri nationalists have been beating the war drums for close to two years. I do not know how many terrorists are in Azerbaijan, but it makes more sense than assuming terrorists are operating out of tiny Armenia, where their movements and activity are more likely to be spotted. We need to keep in mind that an Armenian did not stand in Baku and accuse the country of harboring terrorists; it was none other than the probable next Turkish Prime Minister. It was not the Armenian Interior Minister who stated recently that terrorists were operating from Azerbaijan, it was the Azeri minister. It was not a former president of Armenia who accused President Aliyev in 1998 of aiding terrorists; it was the late Albufaz Elchibey. COUNTERACTING NEGATIVE PUBLICITY Apparently seeing the danger of what has been revealed about Azerbaijan, President Aliyev took steps to counteract the negative publicity. On January 15, Azerbaijan banned the US-based charity Benevolence International Foundation (BIF) because the group co-operated with and aided terrorist organizations. A spokesman for the Azeri Interior ministry said, Some charities, under the cover of helping impoverished parts of society, have been working with terrorist organizations, propagandizing their ideas and promoting religious hatred. BIF had already been blacklisted by US authorities for some time for financing extremist groups, but up to last week, Azerbaijan demurred in clamping down on the organization. It will remain difficult, if not impossible, in the foreseeable future to get the US to say or do anything serious about Azeri indiscretions. Keep in mind that high-powered folks such as Vice President Richard Cheney, former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, former Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, former White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, former National Security Advisers Brent Scowcroft and Zbigniew Brzezinski, form Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard L. Armitage, and a host of former members of Congress, all of whom still have the ears of people in power, have grown wealthy from dipping into the largess of the oil barons. Whether they do it intentionally or by association, these Washington luminaries serve as a shield for Baku. That slippery stuff will allow Azerbaijan to do things such as harboring terrorists with perhaps behind-the-door consultations. Human Rights Watch reports that this past June in Nardaran, Azerbaijan, an Azeri village where citizens protested against Pres. Aliyev, a policeman pointed a pistol at a five-year-old child and demanded that grandpa surrender or else. This was not an Armenian policeman working for the Azeri president. It was an ethnic Azeri working for Mr. Aliyev who threatened to blow the brains out of the innocent child. So before Azeris continue propaganda against Armenia, Mr. Aliyev should read the ditty about people who live in glass houses. Indeed, none other than the Turkish government has made an appeal to guard its embassy and its people against terrorists. The appeal was not made in Athens, Berlin, London and obviously not in Yerevan. The Turkish government demanded additional safeguards for its personnel in Baku where terrorists have killed Turks. So Mr. Aliyev, what nation uses terrorists?","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2003-02-22,1
"The Society for Armenian Studies (SAS) held its annual membership meeting here on November 23, 2002. The meeting was held in conjunction with the 36th Annual Conference of the Middle Eastern Studies Association (MESA). Founded in 1974, SAS is an international organization which represents more than 200 scholars and teachers involved in the field of Armenian studies. The Secretariat of the Society is headquartered at the Armenian Studies Program at California State University, Fresno. SAS President Barlow Der Mugrdechian welcomed members to the annual meeting.

"9) THE BIRTH OF THE ARMENIAN PROPAGANDA AND THE ORIGIN OF THE ARMENIAN QUESTION Turkish academicians, historians and political scientists keep parroting the same repetitious counterarguments, often rationalizing and justifying the forced deportation of the Ottoman Armenian population during the fateful years of 1915-1923, and cynically claiming that the intent of this relocation was to protect said population from war damages. They emphasize that the Armenian as well as Muslim casualties were the result of disease, starvation and inter-communal fighting;, because of the war situation, the state couldn't extend necessary protection over its citizens. Repetition of these unacceptable explanations and counterarguments by almost all Turkish apologists over and over again gives the impression that these deceptive narratives originate from the same source: the writings and history books of the one of the greatest forgers of history, Esat Ahmet Uras, known for his pioneering work in the establishment of the Armenian Genocide denial school in Turkey. In his article, published in Defense and Aviation magazine. Professor Hasan Koni of Ankara University claims that the origin of the genocide allegations and birth of the Armenian propaganda, as he calls it, was initiated by the British Foreign Ministry's Propaganda Office and Political Secret Service Departments. According to Prof. Koni, in order to influence American public opinion, and to facilitate the U.S.'s entry into WWI, these two British government agencies released and disseminated daily articles, falsely accusing the Turks of committing atrocities against Christian Armenian subjects. According to Prof. Koni, the British Secret Service assigned James Bryce and his researcher Arnold Toynbee to this task. In his turn, Toynbee established links with Protestant missionaries in Turkey to obtain information about the alleged maltreatment of Armenians at the hands of Muslim Turks. According to Koni, the British Foreign Ministry later published these missionaries' accounts in the Blue Books series, slandering Turks for wartime crimes that they didn't commit. Prof. Koni asserts, These propaganda articles are up to now still used against Turkey by Armenians and Greeks. STATEMENTS FROM SUKRU ELEKDAG Former Turkish Ambassador to Washington, Sukru Elekdag, now adviser to the Turkish National Security, claims that the meeting between Armenian leaders and the Ottoman officials in Erzurum to secure Armenian loyalty to the Sublime Porte in the event of war was not successful. Armenians had already obtained promises from Russia for the creation of an autonomous state, including not only the areas under (Czarist) Russian rule in the Caucasus but also substantial parts of Eastern Anatolia. Ambassador Elekdag, quoting Uras, continues, Armenian leaders told Enver Pasha that they only wanted to remain neutral, yet their sympathy for the Russians was evident and, in fact, soon after the meeting, several prominent Ottoman Armenians, including a former member of the (Ottoman) parliament, slipped away to the Caucasus to collaborate with Russian officials. He repeats the same story, that as soon as Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire and the Russians forces advanced into Ottoman territory in Eastern Anatolia, they were led by units composed of volunteer Ottoman and Russian Armenians, who were joined by the Armenians who had deserted the Ottoman armies and went over to the Russians. (The fact is that Armenians in the Ottoman Empire served under their Sultan, and Armenians in the Russian Empire served under their Czar. This was the fate of Armenians living between the borders of two mighty empires, and destined to fight against one other. Armenian leaders were proved to be correct in advising the Sublime Porte not to enter the war; if they had listened, they could have prevented the final collapse of their empire.) Numerous Turkish historians, academicians and political scientists, like Turkkaya Ataov, Pulat Tacar, Ali Hikmet Alp, Hasan Koni, Hasan Kanbolat, Nazmi Gul, Kamer Kasim, Davut Kilic, Sedat Laciner, Aydan Iyigungor, Arslan Terzioglu, Salahi R. Sonyel and Gunduz Aktan, all blame the treacherous Armenians for rebelling against the Ottoman state and collaborating with the enemy. They all assert that deportation and relocation orders were not preplanned, as Armenians claim; rather, they were preventive measures taken under war circumstances, as a response to the Armenian uprising. According to Turkish apologists, The killings that occurred were from both sides, and should be considered isolated incidents since the Ottoman authorities did their best under the circumstances to protect the deportees. Professor Vahakn Dadrian totally lacerates and utterly debunks these Turkish fabrications in his studies published in prestigious American academic publications, including the Yale Journal of International Law, Journal of Political and Military Sociology, and International Journal of Middle East Studies and many more. THE ARGUMENTS OF YILMAZ OZTUNA Yilmaz Oztuna, in discussing The Political Milieu of the Armenian Question, presents very familiar Turkish arguments and traces the Armenian Question to the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which ended with the signing of the Treaty of San Stefano on March 3, 1878. According to Oztuna, this treaty was not acceptable to the European Powers (in particular, the British). He continues: The Treaty of Berlin, signed on July 13, 1878, officially ended the Ottoman-Russian War and established a new equilibrium in Europe. Defiantly, Oztuna continues, Defeated by Russia, the Ottoman government was forced to accept the Treaty of Berlin. Later, in disgust, he argues, According to Article 61, the Ottomans were to enact reforms for the Armenian minority in six of its eastern provinces: Sivas, Erzurum, Harput (modern Elazig,) Diarbakir, Bitlis and Van. He continues, Despite its goodwill, it was impossible for the Ottoman administration to enact reforms for such a small and widely scattered minority in the region where a predominantly feudal populace lived in villages, and where significant urban centers were few and far between. Oztuna, echoing his Turkish colleagues' arguments, continues, It was a move that would threaten Muslim-Armenian relations; and that is exactly what happened. Oztuna later postulates, It was clear that Britain, France and Russia wanted to have control over events in eastern Anatolia. However, Germany, Austro-Hungary and Italy, as the other signatories of the Treaty of Berlin also felt they had rights over the region. Sultan Abdulhamid II knew that Italy did not have the strength to meddle in the Armenian matter and therefore concentrated on separating Germany and Austro-Hungary from the triumvirate of Britain, France and Russia. In a stunning confession, this Turkish historian admits, Eastern Anatolia was not on the foreign policy agendas of the these two nations, as Berlin and Vienna would gain no benefit; rather, quite the reverse, the British, French and Russians (who had the most to gain) tried to maintain their influence over the Armenians, and kept the Armenian issue on their foreign policy agendas. According to Oztuna, Knowing this, Abdulhamid declared to the German ambassador in Istanbul in 1895 that Article 61 was ridiculous and impossible to implement and that he would rather die than try to execute it He continues with satisfaction: His predication was correct; when Turks violated the treaty, Berlin did not protest Neither did Vienna. This shows the true character of the Ottoman Turkish insincerity and duplicity. FROM BAD TO WORSE: ABDULHAMID TO YOUNG TURKS Despite their international treaty obligations, they were not only balking at implementation of necessary and promised reforms, but also they were actually increasing violence and oppression, and organizing massacres and atrocities against Armenians in Adana and elsewhere. Following the bloody 32-year rule of Red Sultan Abdulhamid II, the Young Turks came to power with many false promises and later entered WWI along with Austria and Germany. The war gave the Young Turks a perfect opportunity to resolve the Armenian Question radically; through a policy of deportation and extermination, they successfully cleared Anatolia from its native Armenian population. Talat Pasha once bragged, What Abdulhamid II couldn't accomplish during his 32-year reign, the Young Turks were able to accomplish in a rather short tune - eradication of the entire Armenian nation. Naturally Oztuna would never admit this reality. He echoes the arguments of Turkish policy makers that the war with Armenia, under Kazim Karabekir, and the treaties signed (in Gumri, Moscow and Kars) considered the Armenian Question finished for good. He astonishingly confesses, When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, it regarded the Armenian Question as a problem pertaining to the Ottoman Empire and left it as such. This is a very interesting admission, truly revealing that the new leaders of Turkish Republic knew exactly what had happened to the Armenians, yet they intentionally dissociated themselves from any responsibilities and made it the problem of Ottoman Turkey, not theirs. Yet, eight decades later, the contemporary Turks are making the Ottoman problems their problems and defending their misrule and genocidal acts. There is no need to repeat the same familiar Turkish counter-arguments over and over again that the Ottoman Turks were innocent of any wrongdoing, and the sole responsibility for the misfortunes of the Ottoman Armenian citizens rests on the Armenian revolutionaries themselves. They still counter-argue that Turks are the victims of unjustifiable slanders and defamations. This is their fundamental weakness. Instead of looking for just and fair answers, the Turkish establishment creates false answers; as a consequence they are preventing true Turkish-Armenian reconciliation.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2003-01-18,1
"As the U.S. enters the second full year of the war against Islamic terrorists, James Taranto, editor of The Wall Street Journal's OpinionJournal.com, has a resolution that depends on American resolve: to work to bring freedom to the Muslim world. People everywhere deserve liberty and opportunity, Mr. Taranto says. This includes those now oppressed by despotism and religious fanaticism in places like Iraq, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria - the breeding grounds of terrorism. Mr. Taranto argues that President Bush has a strong vision of democracy in the Muslim world. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity, the president told the United Nations on Sept. 12. They can one day join a democratic Afghanistan and a democratic Palestine, inspiring reforms throughout the Muslim world. These nations can show by their example that honest government, and respect for women, and the great Islamic tradition of learning can triumph in the Middle East and beyond. Three months later, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced the U.S.-Middle East Partnership Initiative, which aims to encourage free markets, democracy, better education and the emancipation of women in the Muslim world. It is time to lay a firm foundation of hope, Mr. Powell said in a speech to the Heritage Foundation. But, Mr. Taranto says, Aid and trade aren't always sufficient. The Bush administration understands that in order to establish freedom, sometimes you must first overthrow tyranny. The American military was crucial in liberating Germany, Japan, Italy and even the segregationist American South. America took the lead in overthrowing the Taliban's barbarous regime in Afghanistan. Saddam Hussein has made it clear that he will not give up power peacefully, so America's most pressing resolution in 2003 must be to take him out. The Iraqi people deserve no less. OpinionJournal.com, the Web site of The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, was launched in July 2000 and boasts more than one million unique visitors a month.

"Onward to Baghdad: The zeal with which president Bush and his Zionist cheerleaders are pursuing a preconceived and unprovoked war with Iraq is a classic example of how a powerful and ambitious nation can influence and whip up hysteria for aggression. Of course, this would be impossible if we had an alert and objective news media. However, since the US media is acting like the handmaiden of the Zionists, we will go to war with Iraq for the explicit benefit of Israel. And when we do, we will surely multiply many times the number of terrorists who would be willing to die for their illusionary cause. The facts are right before our eyes. Consider the following: For almost 50 years there has been no peace in the Middle East. With all the military might (destructive forces, tanks and missiles, courteous of Uncle Sam), the Israelis have not been able to stop the terrorists from killing innocent civilians. Why? The answer is very simple. We do not wish to face the obvious fact. We are up against an idea, a concept, a burning desire to be free from the domination and occupation of foreign powers. Ideas and concepts must be fought with better ideas and concepts, not with brute force. We cannot destroy an idea with brute force. It has failed historically and it will fail and keep failing. You may ask, what is the idea? The idea is elemental, basic, and universal Simply stated, it says, Get off my back Leave me alone. Do not interfere with my domestic affairs. The Palestinians are simply asking the Israelis to stop building new Jewish settlements on Palestinian lands. Almost 80% of the Palestinian homeland was forcefully converted to a homeland for the Jews of Europe back in 1948. And now, left with only 20% of their original homeland, the Palestinians, the modern David, are fighting the Goliath, Israel, to hold on to their ancestral homes. Over four million Palestinians have become refugees of the world. By any standard of objectivity, this would be classified as ethnic cleansing. Who is more warlike? A or B? (The following is a list of United Nations resolutions against countries A and B) Items: Country A Country B: Number of UN resolutions violated or ignored: 16 68 Countries attacked or invaded: 2 6 Countries occupied for years: 0 3 Countries currently occupying: 0 2 Territory illegally annexed: 0 4 Wars started: 2 4 Possesses weapons of mass destruction: yes Possesses nuclear weapons: no yes Atrocities against civilians (killed): 5,000 17,000 Currently under UN sanctions: yes no 2 According to the objective score card, country B is, and should be, branded the enemy of peace. We will print the names of Countries A and B at the end of the article. Israel seeks $14 billion aid from U.S.: (San Jose Mercury News, Wednesday 11/27/2002.) Israel is asking the Bush administration for $4 billion in new military aid and $10 billion in economic loan Dear Israel, our beloved friend, could you wait a few months until we get our treasury in order? You know that both the state's treasuries and the federal treasury are in the red? The State of California alone has a budget deficit of over $34 billions. Please bear with us. We will more than make up for our inability to oblige you instantly. As a dedicated and obedient friend of yours, I, Haik Marcar, an honorary senator from Israel, promise you more than $14 billion. But, do you think that is enough to keep expanding the borders of Israel and to guarantee my reelection to the U.S. Congress? Dear Sharon, with your permission, may I present you with some outstanding promissory notes: U.S. Aid to Israel Benefits to Israel of U.S. Aid since 1949: Foreign Aid Grants and Loan: $74.16 billion Other U.S. Aid (12.2% of foreign Aid): $9 billion Interest to Israel from Advanced Payments: $1.7 billion Grand Total: $84.9 billion Benefits per Israeli: $14,630 Interest Costs Borne by U.S.$ 49.9 billion Total Cost to U.S. Taxpayers: $134.8 billion Total Cost per Israeli: $23; 240 (American Free Press, December 9, 2002, page 1SJ Our current troubles with the terrorists in the world are a direct consequence of our one-sided foreign policy. Always tilted towards the Israelis. Unless the U.S. adopts an evenhanded foreign policy in the Middle East, neither we nor the Israelis will be free of terrorists. The Sharon government is not interested in any peace now, tomorrow or a hundred years from now. Why should he? When, under the guise of fighting terrorism, he can get all the economic and military support from Uncle Sam and all of Christendom. And, while hunting for the so-called terrorists, he is slowly but surely destroying the basic fabric of the Palestinian society, demolishing their homes, their farms, their mini industry and, above all, their leaders and their humanity. And best of all, he is gobbling up a lot of real estate. Peace does not motivate a Machiavellian state like Israel. Peace would mean both the end of territorial expansion and the flow of monetary support from the Zionists of the world? BRIEF REVIEW OF MILITARY ADVENTURES And now, a brief review of Israel's political and military adventures in the Middle East; In 1956: Israel, in conjunction with France, attacked Egypt to destroy the sovereignty of Egypt over the Suez Canal. Only, the strong hand of President Eisenhower managed to end the misadventure. Was this Iraq? 1967: The brutal attack on the USS Liberty surveillance ship was launched by Israeli jet fighters and torpedo boats. On that infamous day, June 8, on a sunny Sunday, shortly after lunch, at least 12 Israeli jets dropped napalm and left 870 rocket and cannon holes in the unarmed ship. In the aftermath of that friendly gesture, 34 sailors were killed and 171 injured. Two of the Israeli surveillance pilots were born in Brooklyn, N.Y. Of course, another President from Texas, Linden Johnson, accepted the Israeli alibi, with no questions asked, that it was an accident. According to American-Free Press, August 20, 2001, Fifteen years after the incident, the senior Israeli lead pilot, named Amon Even-Tov, approached Liberty survivors and former Congressman, Pete McCloskey about his role in the attack. Even Tov told McCloskey that he had immediately recognized the Liberty as an American vessel and radioed that information to his headquarters, but was told to ignore the American flag and continue his attack. He refused to do so and...returned to base, where he was arrested. The attack was ostensibly carried out to silence America's knowledge of Israeli operational plans of the war against her neighbors. The assault on the Liberty lasted several hours. Lifeboats lowered over the side, awaiting survivors were machine gunned from Israeli torpedo boats. An attack like this by any other nation would mean a declaration of war. 1982: General Sharon attacks Lebanon, demolishes Beirut and massacres 2000 women and children in the refugee camps at Sabra and Shatilla. 2002: The massacre of hundreds of innocent Palestinian civilians at Jenni's refugee camp by Adolph Sharon's occupation troops was allegedly only for reducing terrorism in the world! And, finally, how many Iraqi spies have we caught since the birth of our country? None. But our State Department is deluged with telephone calls daily by Israeli diplomats and Zionist sympathizers to free their master spy, Julius Pollard. Further, who is selling our sensitive military secrets to the Chinese, the Iraqis or the Israelis? We must be one guard as much against the avarice of friends as we are watchful of mischief from foes. RELIGION & THE CLERICS: In general, the year 2002 has not been kind to the Catholic clergy. Not being a Catholic myself, it would be hard for me to imagine the pain and shame some Catholics must feel. However, for what comfort it may provide, the dilemma is not unique to the Catholic priesthood. In fact, I dare say that sexual misconduct may be more widespread among both the Muslim clerics and the rabbis. Of course, the priests are an easy target, simply because they are not insulated with a defensive coating (the controlled media) like the rabbis are. Speaking of rabbis, it was only a few years ago when a rabbi and his wife were exposed in San Francisco on a fraudulent million-dollar charity scheme. It was discovered only because of the lavish bar mitzvah party given for their son. Fleecing Taxpayers: (American Free Press, December 2, 2002) Rabbi Hertz Frankel of New York was found guilty of stealing $6 million in taxpayer money for himself and the Jewish school he directed. He conspired with the school board to put 80 Hasidic women on the school's payroll who were never required to show up for work. In return for receiving free health insurance for their families, the women would turn their paychecks over to Frankel. Busted: (American Free Press, December 2, 2002) Two other New York Rabbis, Rabbi Jacob Bronner and Rabbi Efroim Stein have been convicted of bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars from a taxpayer-funded group established to help Jewish World War II survivors. They pleaded guilty to orchestrating an elaborate plan in which the men would funnel taxpayer dollars through prominent Jewish groups in New York to themselves and their synagogues. The Kosher Subsidy: 'Jewish Main Street' to rise in Foster City (San Jose Mercury News, Tuesday, December 17, 2002, page 3B.) This little news item should knock your socks off, if not your sense of justice and fair play. Foster City, only about 30 miles north of Silicon Valley (San Jose, CA) is about to (as its name suggests) foster some neighborly gesture. According to the Mercury News, ...a 12-acre campus being carved right in the heart of Foster City, alongside the city's police station, firehouse, civic center and library. The North Peninsula Jewish Campus will feature a Jewish community building, a health and fitness center, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, an accredited Jewish K-8 school, adult and senior services and cultural and educational programs and social services...It is believed to be the first Jewish center built with public partnership (euphemism for subsidy). Are you for real? All that chicken and no ham! And you dare call it a partnership? Call it a rip-off and be done with it. When public money is used to benefit any single cultural or ethnic group, I call that highway robbery. And two swimming pools! There must be a lot of political and cultural mud to wash away. This certainly must top the list for the fleecing of America. But don't bet your life on it. Some groups in our society know how, to milk a dead cow. But, then again, the fault is not theirs, but ours. We, the silent majority, without a sympathetic ear from the media, have shied away from raising Cain. Taxpayers wake up. It's later than you think. Just remember that our first president, George Washington, went to war against the mightiest empire in the world (The British) over a cup of tea in 1776. Speak up. Tell your representative to quit squandering your tax money on religious or ethnic groups. And, in the words of Cicero, 50 B.C.: We are taxed in our bread and wine; in our income and our investment; on our land and property, not only for base creatures who do not deserve the name of men; for foreign nations who bow to us and accept our largesse and promise to assist in keeping the peace, these mendicant nations who will destroy us when we show a moment of weakness or when our treasury is bare, and surely it is becoming bare. Were they bound to us by ties of love they would not ask for gold...they hate and despise us, and who shall say we are worthy of more? Names of the Countries: A is Iraq and B is Israel.","Marcar, Haik",Armenian Reporter International,2003-01-11,1
"7) THE VICTORY AND TRAGEDY OF THE ARMENIAN NATIONAL CHURCH There is no shortage of pro-Turkish foreign historians, academicians or political scientists, who are either directly recruited or sponsored and, in some cases, assigned to endowed academic chairs by the Turkish government, or who have voluntarily entered into the service of the Turks, out of admiration toward them, for being a true loyal ally of the US. To mention a few, Heath Lowery, Justin McCarthy, Stanford Shaw, Bernard Lewis, Alan Makowsky, Norman Itzkowitz, Andrew Mango, Thomas Goltz, and now Erich Feigi are known for being staunch supporters of the Turkish cause. The Armenian Research Institute in Ankara published an article by Professor Erich Feigi, in which he shamelessly castigated and defamed the Armenian National Church, and accused the church leadership of sponsoring terrorist activities, fanning anti-Turkish hysteria and poisoning the minds of the Armenian youth. One wonders if Professor Feigi is aware at all, or whether he is conveniently ignoring certain facts, that during Friday services in the mosques, mullahs, under government directive, not only preached killing infidel (giaour) Armenians, Greeks and all Christians during the fateful years of 1915-1923, when 1.5 million Ottoman Christians lost their lives, but also played a great role during the 1955 pogroms in Istanbul, which claimed the lives of 200 Turkish Christians, and those of 5,000 Greek Cypriots during the invasion of Cyprus in 1974. The same dark forces played a similar role when they preached the extermination of the Armenian Seed Kurds (as Turks prefer to call them) and 30,000 of them perished during the 1984-1995 anti-Kurdish campaigns. So-called Prof. Feigi, in order to downgrade the international standing of the Armenian Church, states that In spite of the fact that on September 28, 2001, Pope John Paul II visited Etchmiadzin in order to participate in the celebrations of the so-called 1700th anniversary of the foundation of the Armenian Gregorian Church, the history of the church has to be examined closely, questioning the validity of the claim that Armenians accepted Christianity at that early date. Prof. Feigi continues, Everybody who deals with the history of Armenia and with the history of Christianity, knows that this not true. According to Prof. Feigi, Armenian history is made up of mythological elements. According to the nationalist mythology, Armenians claim that they are descendents of the prophet Noah and Hayk. That is the reason why they use Mt. Ararat as a symbol, whereas this mountain is actually within the borders of Turkey. GLARING IGNORANCE One must ponder the credibility and credentials of Professor Feigi when his utter ignorance becomes transparent in reference to historical Armenia and its geography. He fails miserably to realize that all classical historians, from Plutarch to Strabo, from Herodotus to the Arab historians, located Ararat in historical Armenia. In stage of confabulation Prof. Feigi makes the following remarks: So in September the Armenians celebrated the 301 [st] anniversary of the 'first Christian State on earth' to underline this mythology, and the witness of this event was Pope John Paul II. He continues, Why is it that Gregorian Armenians and Catholics show up together? The Armenians want to cover up the situation in Nagorno Karabagh, where about one million people (500,000 to be exact) had to flee from their homes and are refugees now. One marvels as to what his answer would be to the assertion that the Muslim Azeris invited Pope John Paul II to Azerbaijan for publicity purposes and to cover up their recent hideous genocidal policy against Armenians in Sumgait, Ganja, Shahumyan and entire Karabagh. It is not a secret that Haidar Aliyev used His Holiness's visit to conduct an Azeri public relations and propaganda campaign by taking Him to refugee camps, where displaced people have been living in miserable conditions since 1994. He has been spending millions of petrol dollars to build a family dynasty, yet refuses to spend a dime to improve the life of refugees. On the other hand, the Armenians, with their limited resources, were able to meet the needs of the 350,000 Armenian refugees from Azerbaijan. Professor Feigi makes another absurd but misleading allegation. He claims that the Armenians acted as the mentors and protectors of the Alban Church of the Caucasus (Karabagh) in order to underline their claim of the first Christian state, since (according to him)Albans (according to Azeri historians, predecessors of the Azeri people) were the first nation to accept Christianity as state religion. People who study the region's church history will be bewildered by his logic. In fact, the origin of this kind of fabrication can be traced back to the late Azeri professor Ziya Bunyatov. According to Bunyatov, Karabagh natives were original Albans (Aghuans), the predecessors of the Azeris, who accepted Christianity for the first time in history as state religion, and they are not ethnically related at all to Armenians. If the allegations of Feigi and Bunyatov are true, why then do the Azeris wish to forcibly empty Karabagh from its natives, if they are Christianized Azeris as opposed to ethnic Armenians? ARMENIAN CHURCH AND TERRORISM The Ottoman History Research Center in Ankara University published a book in 1996 authored by Dr. Erdal liter and titled Armenian Church and Terrorism (Ermeni Kilisesi ve Terror). Dr. Erdal claims that Armenian Church was the center of terrorism; Armenian patriarchs and clergy were preaching hatred against the Turks, were busy organizing terrorist cells and acts of terrorism against the Muslims, and also encouraging rebellion against the Ottoman slate. The author claims that the Armenian Church was issuing instructions to the Armenians to welcome and host foreigners, spread and feed them with anti-Turkish propaganda; namely, that Armenian Christians were persecuted and murdered by the Ottoman authorities, in order to prepare legal ground for the European intervention into the internal affairs of Ottoman state. So-called Judge Samuel A. Weems' recent book Armenia: The Great Deception - Secrets of a Christian Terrorist State, which, in reality, was authored and commissioned by the Turkish Forum, also portrays Armenians as terrorists and accuses Armenian Church leaders of sponsoring terrorism against Muslim Turks and Azeris. Their sinister purpose is to mislead world public opinion and turn it against Armenians. Why is Ankara spending millions to conduct an anti-Armenian campaign? They are very concerned that Armenia is getting positive coverage in the Western media and they are worried that the ground is being prepared to recognize the Armenian Genocide and to grant self-determination rights for Karabagh Armenians, which is gaining momentum recently in many corners of the civilized world. The Turkish propaganda machine and its hired guns are attacking the Armenian Church and its leadership in order to discredit the entire Armenian nation. Prof. Erich Feigi's inflammatory and deceptive anti-Armenian rhetoric takes an ugly turn when he attacks Western supporters of the Armenian cause. He calls Franz Werfel's bestseller The Forty Days of Musa Dagh as a fake Bible. He claims, Since the first publication of the Forty Days of Musa Dagh, Turks are slandered as rude tyrants, if not butchers. He continues, During the war, Arnold Toynbee's The Treatment of the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire fulfilled the same duty as Werfel's novel did. He adds, Toynbee's wretched piece of work was plain war propaganda sponsored by Lord Bryce and his ministry in order to force the US into war with the Ottoman Empire. The Protestant churches, which were fighting so long and so hard for a Protestant? The Armenian Republic in Eastern Anatolia willingly joined this devilish party. This so-called professor claims that Forty Days became a kind of a new Bible, and he continues, The message was clear: How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on earth? He adds, Werfel had chosen this verse as a motto for his masterpiece, unfortunately he became - with this motto and his book - the basic instrument of Armenian postwar terrorism, which killed not only so many innocent people but also the reputation of a whole nation. 8) TODAY'S ARMENIA AND MOTIVES BEHIND THE GENOCIDE ACCUSATIONS; MORE THAN NATIONAL IDENTITY The author of this article, Ali Hikmet Alp, is former representative of Turkey to OSCE and the Minsk Group. In this article, he levels the familiar accusations that Armenia's motive behind genocide accusations is to distract world attention from Armenian aggression and crimes against Azeris and prepare legal grounds to justify territorial and financial compensation demands from Turkey. With few exceptions, almost all Turkish historians, academicians, political scientists, politicians and media commentators are all in agreement with Ambassador Alp's assessment. He states that he is not a historian and his article is a political assay, not a historical one. He claims that Armenian historians write Armenian history for Armenians, and in their reference notes one can see the same familiar names such as Dadrian, Hovannisian, Suny (?), and Balakian (?) (For the record, Suny's version of history is closer to the Turks' while Balakian is an author, poet and professor of English, not a historian.) Ambassador Alp reveals his limited knowledge of Armenian history; he opposes the Armenians for the sake of contradicting Armenian views and accounts. He examines Turkish-Armenian relations and the Genocide issue in a more sophisticated way, and he acknowledges that Recently Turkish intellectual circles were critical of the official Turkish policies towards Armenia and posing the following hypothetical criticism: First Criticism: Turkey had to establish diplomatic relations with Armenia immediately after gaining its independence. Second Criticism: Turkey should make more effort to improve its relations with Armenia and, in particular, should not let its Armenian policy be made hostage to Azerbaijan. Third Criticism: Because of political tension, the tremendous potential of Turkish-Armenian economic relations is being lost in the process. We may add to this list an accusation frequently made by Armenian circles that Turkey has been too pro-Azerbaijan, even to extent of overlooking its own interests. It is fair to say that certain progressive Turkish forces have been advocating this approach for many years now but they have always been overruled by the hard-liners. Even the most recent statement by new Turkish Foreign Minister Yasar Yakis that Turkey wants to establish a cordial and working relationship with all its neighbors, including Armenia, as usual, was retracted by the functionaries of the Turkish foreign ministry establishment. RESPONSES TO CRITICISMS Ambassador Ali Hikmet gives the following responses to the critics of the official Turkish foreign policy: The answer to the first criticism is rather simple: Turkey recognized Armenian independence without delay and entered into consultations for the establishment of diplomatic relations. He continues: They could not, However, be conclusive, since Armenia did not make even a vague promise to stop its official activities for the recognition of the 'genocide' and refused a confirmation of the present borders, even by a reference to valid agreement and treaties. (Obviously Turks don't feel secure in these issues, due to the fact that they too know well that a great injustice was done to the Armenians, but they are not willing to take the necessary corrective measures, not even in symbolic ways, like opening dialogue for border negotiations, taking joint actions to preserve the neglected Armenian monuments, opening their registry records and giving fair hearings to Armenian plaintiffs in reference to illegally confiscated Armenian property and land issues.) The answer to the second criticism should be examined together with accusations of 'a threat from Turkey' as the same Armenian circles often state. He continues: Both countries are members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and parties to the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE). Armenia has never brought to OSCE a question of 'Turkish threat,' knowing well that it could not be substantiated, but on the contrary would expose aggressive Armenian policies. He continues: The intrusive on-site inspection system of the CFE Treaty never detected any Turkish military move or force concentration in contravention of the Treaty, even at the height of Armenia's war against Azerbaijan. Armenian forces in Upper Karabagh and other occupied territories are de facto left out of the CFE inspectors, its non-compliance with the treaty is tolerated. He adds, Regarding border issues, Turkey strictly observed a policy of status quo; in contrast was the Armenian rejection of the reaffirmation of the mutual borders. (He is a polished politician; he knows the political craft of lying and distorting realities. We all know that during the height of the Azeri-Armenian war, Ankara was ready to intervene, and massed troops and tank divisions along the Turkish-Armenian border; if Russian Chief of the Staff Marshal Shapashnikov hadn't issued a warning not to intervene, an imminent Turkish invasion would have been put in action.) He continues: The 'Turkish threat is no more than a pretext for the Armenian military effort, Russian-Armenian military cooperation, presence of Russian military bases and for asking the Armenian people further sacrifices at the cost of lower living standards. (One may respectfully ask if the ambassador has justification and explanation for Turkey's ambitious 25 billion-dollar rearmament project, when the Turkish economy is at an impasse and remains a basket case, and Turkish masses are suffering from fifty-digit inflation. Such an astronomical spending is beyond Turkey's defense needs and signals Turkey's aggressive intentions and desire to project its power beyond its borders,) The answer to the third criticism, although it looks like an economic one, is in reality charged with complex political issues. First of all, any Turkish government, in deciding about its relations with these two countries in conflict, has to take into consideration that Azerbaijan will weigh heavier in the balance, not only because of their special relationship or its brighter economic prospects, but also because of the fact that Azerbaijan is the party whose territory is under illegal occupation. He continues: As if that were not enough, Armenia willingly associates itself with anti-Turkish initiatives and, whenever possible, does not itself refrain from taking such initiatives. He goes one step further to justify the current Turkish pro-Azeri policy by saying that Besides the oil and gas issues, the Turkish government has to take into account the interest of the Turkish companies doing business in or with Azerbaijan, despite existing difficulties. He also asserts that there is no Turkish embargo against Armenia; in fact, trade is made with Armenia trough friendly Georgia, and Georgians are making extra profit which they deserve since they are under tremendous Russian economic and political pressure. (He glosses over the realities. Fairly recently, the Turkish government threatened Turkish businessmen with sanctions and legal actions if they continued to advocate opening the Turkish-Armenian border to conduct business.)","Acemoglu, Murag",Armenian Reporter International,2003-01-04,1
"There are a few former Georgian Armenians living in Yerevan with whom I have had an opportunity to speak. At the moment, a few of them are angry because they perceive that Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze talks out of both sides of his mouth when it comes to democracy and rights of Armenians living in Georgia. It did not escape the attention of these disgruntled people that, on November 19, an international conference was held in Tbilisi regarding the Javakheti region of Georgia (along the northern Armenian border). The conference was called The Integration and Development of the Samtskhe-Javakheti Region and it was jointly organized by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM) and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP). The Armenians are the overwhelming majority of the population in the region, but no one was invited to the conference to hear their concerns. According to the Charter of the OSCE, one of the functions of its HCNM is to prevent conflict. The prevention aspect also is endemic to the UNDP. It is strange and contrary to conflict prevention techniques to refrain from hearing the views of the majority population when discussions are in progress about issues that impact upon their fate. According to spokespeople for the Virk organization, the reason that the Armenians were not invited was a political one. Political in that both international bodies succumbed to pressure from Mr. Shevardnadze; the Georgian government refuses to recognize Virk as a legally constituted political party. EASING TENSIONS The Virk Party is based primarily in Javakhk, but it has cells throughout Georgia. Virk is the historical Armenian designation for the densely Armenian-populated areas of Georgia that run parallel to the Armenian border, but are inside the Georgian Republic. This is an area where there have been clashes between Armenians and Georgian authorities. There had been talk about secession and the makings of another Karabagh. However, beginning with former President Ter-Petrossian and now President Kocharian, both Armenian presidents have gone to the region and spoken to the Armenian leaders in efforts to ease the tensions. The Armenian leaders have made it plain to the Georgian government and to the Armenians in the region that they will not support violence or attempts to secede. In turn, the Georgian government has assured Armenia and the Armenians in the region that every effort will be made to meet their daily needs. One of the most critical issues is the loss of jobs with the withdrawal of Russian troops and the closure of the Russian bases where they were employed. Another fear of the Armenians is that Georgia is about to bow to Turkish pressure and to allow a Turkish airbase to be created from the abandoned former Russian base and that Georgia will allow the area to be infused with large numbers of Meshkitarian Turks. Rightly or wrongly, the Armenians in the region suspect a plot hatched by Turkey, Azerbaijan and Georgia to reduce the Armenians to a minority in the region and to have the area devolve into Nakhitchevanization. In other words, to pressure the Armenians out of the region by reducing them to a minority with no say over their own destinies. This was a strategy employed by Haydar Aliyev when he was Communist Party boss in Azerbaijan and then in Nakhitchevan. Outwardly, emigration from the area by Armenians would appear to be of their own volition, when in reality living in the region would become intolerable. IDEAL OPPORTUNITY This conference was an ideal opportunity to listen to an organization that represents many Armenians. It was also a time when other major Armenian groups should have been invited to express their concerns, along with other peoples residing in the region. That is the democratic process and President Shevardnadze claims to espouse democracy. The OSCE and the UN officials have an obligation to ensure that democracy is upheld for events that they sponsor, regardless of what the official politicians of the country desire. Supposedly, both the OSCE and the UN exist to make life livable and happy for people, but how is that possible when they do not open the venue to listen to the voices of people that live in the region under discussion? Because the conference appeared to function as an in-group process, the majority population, or at least one organization that represents them, felt like an outcast. Thus, mistrust exists. It appears that the Georgian government and the two international organizations think that they can resolve the socioeconomic, cultural, economic, and education problems of the Samtskhe-Javakhk by government fiat. This top-down approach has historically been the antithesis of settling issues. Hopefully, the Armenians in the region will remain calm to see what develops, and Tbilisi will make an effort to involve the people in the decision-making process. When will the governments learn that the way to keep peace is to involve the population in matters that impact on their lives? When citizens participate in the decision-making process, they have the feeling of ownership of the decisions and become infinitely more prone to make the laws work. INTEGRATION, NOT ASSIMILATION The Armenians do not want assimilation, they insist upon integration. At this point, the people in Yerevan with whom I spoke do not want secession; they wish the ability to make the decisions the shape their destinies. Even the more agitated people with whom I spoke do not insist upon secession, even as they spoke of autonomy. The Armenians have had a history of anxiety about their security in relation to the Muslim populations. The Chechens have expressed many aggressive comments about Armenians, ala Karabagh. While the area is not Karabagh, they have seen the recent arrival of Chechen irregular troops in the SamtskheTavakhk region, or at least these are the rumors. Rather than tempting the Armenians to arm themselves, it is much more conducive to peace for the Georgian government to address the concerns of the people. These concerns are issues that the OSCE and the UN are obligated to investigate - if they are serious about conflict prevention. Frankly, the few [Armenians from the region with whom I spoke have stated that they will not sit back and allow their families to be placed in harm's way. Prevention is action to stop the distress of humans from escalating into potential violence. It appears that, in Georgia, the government and the international organizations may have dropped the ball. However, as we know from American football, a fumble is not impossible to recover.","Moordadian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2003-01-04,1
"The November 3 elections in Turkey were everything, and even more interesting than, most observers anticipated. Roughly three months since the Turkish Grand National Assembly passed a set of laws guaranteeing a freer and more modernized society (see Hellenic Times, August 30, 2002 issue, page 5), the Turkish people elected, by an over-whelming margin of victory, the moderate Islamist Party of Justice and Development (AKP). The election was momentous. The electorate, fed up with chronic corruption, inequality and social injustice, and feeling the growing pains of an acute economic crisis, punished the entire political class. The trauma of severe earthquakes in August 1999 and the disastrous performance of now-ex Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's coalition government further alienated the public from the three mainstream parties sharing power in that government. The Democratic Left Party, led by Mr. Ecevit, barely received 1.6 percent of the vote, while the Nationalist Action Party and the Motherland Party, the two other partners in the coalition, did only marginally better. The centrist True Path Party of former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller managed a more respectable showing with 8.6 percent, but it also failed to pass the 10-percent threshold necessary for any party to gain representation in Parliament. Of the old political guard, only the Republican People's Party of Deniz Baycal managed to survive with 24.5 percent of the vote, gaining 185 seats in the 550-seat National Assembly. The Republican People's Party, established by Mustafa Kemal Attaturk, who founded the modern Turkish state in 1923 on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, was openly supported by the state bureaucracy and the Army. In spite of this support and the presence of Kemal Dervis, an American-educated economist and former International Monetary Fund Vice President and the architect of Turkey's economic stabilization program, the party had to settle for second place, winning the position of the main opposition in Parliament. In all, 18 political parties took part in the Turkish elections, and AKP received about 34.5 percent in the polls, enough to guarantee an absolute majority in the Turkish Parliament. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the party's leader, who was a successful mayor of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul) went to great lengths to reassure the Turkish establishment, as well as the West, that he is moderate and that his party would continue to pursue Turkey's ambition to integrate with Europe. His Islamic roots notwithstanding, Mr. Erdogan pledged continued participation in NATO and a close working relationship with the United States. Shedding as much of his anti-secular, anti-establishment credentials as possible, and toning-down the anti-American rehtoric of AKP's platform, was a deliberate, if not entirely successful, strategy to gain acceptance by Turkish society and the outside world. Due to a conviction in 1999 by a Turkish court for inciting religious hatred and promoting violence against the State after reciting a religious poem in public, Mr. Erdogan has not been eligible for becoming a member of Parliament, and thus, the Turkish Constitution bars him from assuming the office of Prime Minister. There is already talk for passing an amendment by the National Assembly, however, which would allow him to do so in the near future. Meanwhile, on November 16, President Ahmed Sezer nominated Abdullah Giul, Mr. Erdogan's deputy in the AKP leadership, as the new Premier. The new government was formed on November 27 and is won a vote of confidence in Parliament on November 30. Most political observers in Turkey have credited the leadership of Mr. Erdogan (a skilled tactician and an artful campaigner, and who was also a very popular Mayor of Istanbul) for his party's victory. The deep economic crisis (the average income has declined by 32 percent in 2001, compared to the beginning of the 1990's, while the unemployment rate has reached a stunning 13.9 percent) and the electorate's dis-illusionment with the conventional political parties also influenced the outcome of the election. IMPROVE RELATIONS The real test, however, for the mild-mannered and charismatic Mr. Erdogan and his moderate Islamist Party begins now, with the formation of its own government. In his first remarks regarding Greece, the AKP leader expressed his willingness to improve relations with Turkey's longtime rival and his readiness to negotiate, in good faith, to resolve differences on Cyprus and the Aegean Sea. As far as membership in the European Union is concerned, Mr. Erdogan pledged cooperation toward meeting EU criteria. Embarking on his first tour of Europe on November 18, Mr. Erdogan met with Greek Prime Minister Costats Simitis and the Greek Government's main opposition party leader, Costas Karamanlis, and was the guest of honor at a luncheon hosted by Greek Foreign Minister George Papandreou. He stressed that Greece should not be treated as an adversary of Turkey and concurred with the Greek position that United Nation Secretary-General Kofi Annan's plan for a comprehensive settlement on Cyprus was a starting point for negotiations. On Turkey's accession to the EU, he reiterated the Turkish position on setting a firm date in the near future for the beginning of accession negotiations. Mr. Simitis, while welcoming the positive attitude of the new Turkish leader, insisted that Turkey must first make clear that it intends to implement the EU's Copenhagen criteria, as well as make progress on the Cyprus issue. THE END OF EUROPE Meanwhile Turkey's overtures, vis-à-vis Europe and its efforts to accede to the EU, were set back by remarks made by Vallery Giscard D'Estaing, the former President of France who now chairs the Constitutional Convention for the Future of Europe. In an interview published by the influential Paris daily newspaper Le Monde on November 29, Mr. D'Estaing insisted that Turkey is not a European country, and inviting it to join our elite Union would mean the end of Europe as we know it. The former President of France added that Turkey, the only Muslim Country-candidate for EU membership, is close to Europe politically and strategically, but only a small part of it belongs to Europe geographically. It's capital is not in Europe; 95 percent of its population lives outside of Europe; it is not a European country. Mr. D'Estaing was also quoted as saying that those who backed Turkey's accession were the adversaries of the European Union. His remarks, uncharacteristically blunt for a former head of state, were widely criticized in Turkey, as well as in Europe. EU Foreign Policy Coordinator Javier Solana distanced himself from Mr. D'Estaing's statements, while EU Executive Commission President Romano Prodi called the remarks unfortunate, clarifying that they were the former French President's personal opinions. TOO POOR AND TOO DIFFERENT On December 9, another Prominent European leader, Edmund Stoiber, Chairman of the conservative German main opposition Christian Democratic Party, told Der Spiegel, a leading German publication, that Turkey is very poor. Its average per capita income is less than 20 percent of EU's average, and it also has a very different historical and culltural backgroud. It's not a member of the European community of values, and it never particpated in the struggles of the peoples' of Europe for freedom, self determination and solidarity. It is too poor and too different to become an EU member at this time. Photograph (Tayyip Erdogan with Jean-Claude Juncker talking to one another)","Filios, Demetris A",Hellenic Times,2003-01-02,1
"5) THE BALANCE SHEET AND RELATIONS BETWEEN TURKEY AND ARMENIA Omer Lutem, Director of the Armenian Research Institute in Ankara, takes a pessimistic view of current Turkish-Armenian relations and balances the Armenian side for not being forthcoming. He notes that an unofficial Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission, composed of six Turks and four Armenians, established on July 9, 2001, gave reason to hope official contacts reach negotiated settlement. Yet the Armenian side made is amply clear that, from there for negotiation; rather, they were attempting to reach an understanding on the outstanding issues, which were dividing both sides and preventing a real reconciliation. According to Mr. Lutem, What is of interest is that genocide was not directly or indirectly mentioned as one of the matters that the commission will be dealing with it. He continues, In the same manner there is also no mention of the Karabagh conflict; it is clear that the parties have chosen to leave aside the topics that are difficult to agree upon and adopted a policy aimed at cooperation in other fields. He later quotes the Armenian Foreign Ministry's press release on July 13, 2001 that this initiative could not replace direct state-level contacts aimed at solving the conflict. According to Mr. Lutem, Armenian press criticism led Armenian members of the Commission (TARC) to feel the need to go on the defensive and make statements clarifying that the genocide is not negotiable and that their activities would not prevent the process of the recognition of the Armenian genocide, he continues, While the debates continued and pressure mounted for the Armenian members of the Commission to resign, in September the German Parliament refused to take the genocide issue on their agenda, stating a reason for this decision the fact that there were contacts initiated on the issue between Turkish and Armenian civil society organizations. GENOCIDE ISSUE STICKS OUT In a stunning acknowledgment, Mr. Lutem elaborates, This development had a serious effect on the Armenian members, as did the European Parliament's attachment of great importance to the Commission in a decision taken about Turkey on November 15, 2001. He further concludes, As a result, during the second meeting of the Commission in Istanbul on September 23-25, 2001, the Armenian members began demanding that the genocide issue be taken up directly or indirectly and particularly that a reference must be made to it in the statements is sued following the meetings. He continues, In the third meeting held in New York on November 18-21, it was agreed that an independent organization called International center for Transitional Justice would determine if the United Nations Convention on Genocide of 1948 would be applicable to the events of 1915. However the words of David L. Philips on his matter were reflected in the press as establishing whether the mass killing and deportation of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 do or do not constitute genocide. Mr. Lutem, like another Turkish apologist Gunduz Aktan, proclaims legal matter such as establishing whether the 1948 Convention can be applied retrospectively was transformed into an effort at historic judgment about whether the events could be considered to be genocide. Characteristic of the Turkish mastery of deception, he continues, When the Turkish members of the Commission drew the attention of the International Center for Transitional Justice to this fact, the Armenian members of the Commission sent David L. Philips a letter, stating that the Turkish-Armenian Reconciliation Commission would no longer proceed. What a lie! The fact is that the Turkish members of the Commission received orders from Ankara not to proceed with, arbitration and withdraw their early consent. No wonder, as he stated. Turkish authorities showed no reaction to the termination of the activities of the Commission. The director of the Armenian Research Institute in Ankara acknowledges that Armenians were successful in securing French, Russian, Italian and Papal Office recognition of the Armenian Genocide but were unsuccessful in securing recognition from Swiss, Slovak, British and German Parliaments, and he concludes that this constituted a serious setback for the Armenian Diaspora and Armenia. TURKS NEVER AT FAULT It is amazing how the policymakers in Ankara are obsessed with the genocide issue alone and ignoring more important aspects of Turkish-Armenian relations in terms of regional security, economic integration, cooperation in energy sectors, establishing commercial-transportation links, utilizing water resources, jointly studying seismic fault lines, developing joint ventures in science, education and social development, etc. The Turks never accept their shortcomings and they always criticize others for their failures. Currently they are fuming that the European Union is creating artificial barriers and asking for compliance and implementation of reforms before open accession talks with Ankara after December 2004. Instead of soul searching, Turkish policymakers are still dwelling on old cliches, like the EU is a Christian club; Europeans are using discrimination against them because they are Muslim, etc. In the same context, they are blaming Armenians, for instance, for conducting an anti-Turkish campaign throughout world. With this kind of rhetoric, suffering from inferiority or guilt complex and emotionalism, they are missing the real issues, as follows: deficiencies in their human rights records or minority right protection; shortcomings in the implementation of democracy, and use of oppressive and abusive methods and torture by the state security forces, which are also known for eliminating political prisoners physically. Turkey is also criticized for the meddling of its military in civilian affairs, illegal occupation of Cyprus, not recognizing the Armenian Genocide and oppressing Kurds. 6) RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE KARABAGH CONFLICT Mr. Lutem recalls the meetings between Presidents Aliyev and Kocharian meeting in Paris in march 2001 and later in Key West, Florida in April, as well as subsequent encounters during meetings of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). He characterizes these meetings as intense but nonproductive. He Believes that the parties to the Karabagh Conflict have very different opinions on its solution. He continues, As a matter of fact, it was clear that their options were contradictory. He analyzes the Armenian and Azeri positions in the following ways: According to Armenians, Karabagh is an Armenian territory that must be annexed and, due to security concerns, the Azerbaijani land surrounding it must be taken as well. He continues: However, Armenia, aware that this extreme position will not find support, is willing to accept, as a temporary solution, the independence of Karabagh and its connection to Armenia via corridor. According to Mr. Lutem, The Azerbaijani opinion on the matter can be summarized as a conviction that Karabagh is the territory of Azerbaijan and that it can at best be granted comprehensive autonomy, he agrees with the Azeri position and pro claims, it must be stated here that according to international law, there is no doubt whatsoever that Karabagh is the territory of Azerbaijan. Revealing his anti-Armenian sentiments, he claims, It is commonly accepted today that Armenia was the victor of the hostilities that had erupted due to the Karabagh conflict in the early 90's because Russia had supplied the Armenian side with all forms of assistance, including weapons deliveries worth over 1 billion US dollars. In exchange, the Russian Federation was given military bases in Armenia. He laments, Russia's special relationship with Armenia allows the Russian Federation to continue exercising influence on the Southern Caucasus. He also blasts president Aliyev for pursuing friendly relations with the Russian Federation, for agreeing to rent the Gabala radar installation to the Russians for 10 years, as a price to win Russian support against Armenians. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STORY What Mr. Lutem is conveniently forgetting is that, during the same period, the government in Ankara transferred huge amounts of NATO military hardware and equipment to their Azeri allies, and dispatched five thousand Turkish military men, under the disguise of being retired and volunteer former military servicemen and officers, to assist the Azeri war efforts. Additionally, Ankara sent a huge amount of monetary aid, and the Turkish Military Staff directly participated in the military planning of the Azeri offensive which failed miserably. Also he does not acknowledge the very fact that, today, Turkey has established military bases in both Georgia and Azerbaijan, which are considered to constitute a direct threat against the security of Armenia. Mr. Lutem also criticizes Karabagh mediators for not forcing Armenia to vacate so-called occupied Azeri territories. He continues, France has no particular interest in the Caucasus. The interest that this country shows in the Karabagh conflict is directed more towards satisfying its small but highly active Armenian minority. He conveniently forgets the fact that Turkish officials made numerous statements that they could not establish diplomatic relations with Armenia since that would upset their citizens of Azeri origin. Therefore, if Turkey is so concerned with its Azeri public opinion, why shouldn't France show the same sensitivity? This is a perfect example of the Turkish double standard. He criticizes French president Jacques Chirac for sending a message to President Robert Kocharian on the occasion of the assumption of the duties of the new French Ambassador, in which he stated that he hoped that 2002 would be year of dialogue in the Southern Caucasus and that he wished that the problem be resolved on the basis of the Paris principles. He continues, These statements of the French President were striking since Azerbaijiani authorities had been steadily stressing that no principles for the solution of the Karabagh conflict were agreed upon during the meeting in Paris in March. Retrospectively, we all know that the Paris and key West principles are real and do exist, but Aliyev is afraid of this constituents to admit the truth. Obviously Mr. Lutem also wants to believe that those principles don't exist since they are contrary to the wishes of the Ankara government. According to Mr. Lutem, as he stated, Concerning the US, it is fair to say that this country too is under influence of its Armenian minority. Despite the fact that, following the hostilities, other Azerbaijani territories alongside Karabagh were occupied as well and that close to a million (500,000 to be exact) Azerbaijanis were forced to flee and live in miserable conditions, the Congress stopped all aid to Azerbaijan as if it were the Armenians who had come under attack. TURKISH PRECONDITIONS Again, Mr. Lutem conveniently forgets that the Azeris were the initial aggressors; they were the ones who tried to deport all the Armenians from their native lands, and 400,000 Armenians were forced to flee Azerbaijan, becoming refugees overnight. Mr. Lutem believes that No matter what, France, the US and Russia will have to favor the Armenians. He concludes, Today it is clear that the Karabagh conflict cannot be solved without the consent of the US and the Russian Federation. The director of the Armenian Research Institute reveals that when (former) Prime Minister of Turkey Bulent Ecevit paid an official visit to the US in mid-January, he told President Bush that Turkey has four preconditions for the establishment of diplomatic relations with Armenia and listed them as follows: Armenia must abandon its accusations of genocide; Armenia must evacuate Karabagh unconditionally; it must allow the people (Azeris) the right to return to these lands from which they had been expelled; and a corridor be opened (through Meghri) between Nakhichevan and Azerbaijan. Mr. Lutem also criticizes the European Parliament for recognizing the Armenian Genocide on June 14, 1987, according to him, which was just after Turkey's application for full membership 15, 2000, the Armenian Genocide was again included in a regular report on Turkey's progress, shortly after Turkey was announced a candidate of the EU membership. Now Turkey has to wait until 2004 to start accession talks for 2005 if Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria and adheres to European values.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-12-21,1
"AFTER fleeing Nigeria with her fellow Miss World contestants over the weekend, Miss Ireland entrant Lynda Duffy is a damsel in distress no more and can't wait to represent her country in the pageant's new London location next weekend. Though most beauty queens would do anything to capture a crown like Miss World, watching Muslim extremists kill and riot right outside their hotel definitely went above and beyond the call of duty for Duffy and the rest of the ladies, who were looking forward to taking part in what was supposed to be a historic first in the African nation. I feared for my safety and that was my number one concern, Duffy, 22, said. It was the most frightening experience of my life. It's scary to think of what could have happened. Needless to say Lynda's family back in Mayo were crazed with fear, watching nightly newscasts of the killing and bloodletting right outside their daughter's doorstep. I couldn't get to speak to her, and they wouldn't give any information at the hotel, said Lynda's mother Breda. We had our trip booked to Nigeria and I don't know if we'll get a refund. The important thing is that Lynda is safe and happy. No doubt the brunette beauty will be even happier if she brings the title back home to Ireland.

"3) Let the historians decide, and the Armenians in the late Ottoman period. According to Turkish policy makers, the Armenian Question was permanently buried at the Lausanne Peace Conference in 1923. For more than eight decades, the government in Ankara tried to ignore Armenian grievances and demands, until the organized Armenian Diaspora and, recently, the Armenian government began to pursue the recognition of the Armenian Genocide, and the return of the confiscated Armenian properties and lands at international and legal forums with some success. The legislatures of more than a dozen important foreign countries and twenty-six state legislatures have already passed resolutions recognizing or condemning the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish policy makers finally realized the futility of denial, like claiming that the Armenian atrocities never happened or the Kurdish problems don't exist. Now they are changing gears, and in order to prevent the politicization of these outstanding two issues, are trying to historicize them under the slogan let the historians decide. TURKISH REPUBLIC & HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY What they are trying to say is, whatever happened in the past, in the last days of the collapsing Ottoman state, is part of history, and the Turkish Republic has no legal or moral obligations for those events. As the former Speaker of the Grand National Assembly, Omer Izgi, confesses, The founders of the Turkish Republic (Kemalist) were neither uniformed about nor insensitive to the events of the 1915, but simply dissociated themselves by declaring a new Republic over the ashes of the Ottoman Empire. Yet most of the founders of the Turkish Republic in one way or another were involved in the Armenian Genocide, by active participation. They became queasy and turned their faces to the other direction; they enriched themselves through confiscated Armenian property and wealth; they simply didn't want to remember the things that were most embarrassing and distressful. The proponents of Let the historians decide include Justin McCarthy, Heath Lowry, Bernard Shaw, Sukru Elekdag, Turkkaya Ataov, Hasan Koni, Gunduz Aktan, Suleyman Seyfi Ogun, Ozdem Sandberk and many others. Justin McCarthy, the pro-Turkish guru, summarizes this in the following way: There is a vast difference between history written to defend one-sided nationalist convictions and what history should be. He continues, History intends to find the truth about the past. Historians recognize that the truth is illusive. They now have prejudices that affect their judgment. They know they never have all facts. Yet they always try to find the truth, whatever that truth may be. This statement tells a lot about these controversial figures. Former Turkish Ambassador to UK Ozdem Sanberk is more candid about it when he states, We are not there to find truth. McCarthy goes one step further when he states, The historians first ask the most basic question: 'Was there an Armenia? Was there a region within the Ottoman Empire where Armenians were a compact majority that might rightfully demand its own state?' Following this statement, McCarthy, a mouthpiece for the Turkish apologists, parrots the same arguments; namely, that rebellious Armenians and outraged Turks were involved in a civil war, there were 300,000 to 600,000 Armenian and two million Muslim casualties as a result of the civil combat, disease and starvation. He is suggesting that Turkish and Armenian historians and academicians should open their respective archives and sit down around the table and search as to what happened in 1915. ELEKDAG & THE BRITISH BLUE BOOK Sukru Elekdag, former Turkish Ambassador to Washington, tries to discredit the documents concerning the events of 1915 in Armenia, which were published by Viscount James Bryce and historian Arnold Toynbee, as commissioned by the British government (British Parliamentary Blue Book series). Elekdag accuses both of them of having conducted wartime British propaganda against the Ottoman State. He continues: In 1916, Lloyd George (British Prime Minister) encouraged Bryce and Toynbee to collect Turkish atrocity stories in a Blue Book which was placed before the parliament and has become the classic document of the Armenian radical nationalists. He further states that one of the main aims, which motivated the British government into making its propaganda office at the Wellington House prepare such baseless documents was to exploit the American public sympathy for the Armenians and thus ensure that Washington would join the war as soon as possible. Elekdag also offers the following bizarre argument to create further controversy that The British government decided to publish the Blue Book in order to divert the attention from atrocities committed by the Russians against the Jews in the Polish-Lithuanian frontier region in the spring of 1915. He claims further that, As expected, the Germans tried to exploit this situation. The news of the carnage reached the US in February 1916 and thereupon the newspaper - The New York American - urged the American people to demand that Christian England and Christian France restrain the savagery of their barbarous allies (Russians). What Elekdag is trying to do is to historicize the Armenian Genocide while trying vainly to discredit British historical records based on eyewitness accounts, embassy and foreign ministry records in order to exonerate the perpetrators of the Genocide. Yet other Turkish historians and politicians, referring to the Malta trials, claim that the same British authorities had no documents or proof in their hands to indict the captive Ottoman leaders for committing war crimes against Armenians, conveniently forgetting that the British exchanged them with British POWs in Turkish captivity. WHY THEY LIE, DECEIVE AND DISTORT Turkish historians, academicians and politicians use every lie, deception and distortion in order to prove that Turks didn't commit atrocities against Armenians, and they claim that Armenians are creating fairy tales, to maintain their identity in the Diaspora. They attack every credible scholar that defends Armenian arguments. Turkkaya Ataov, in his book The Armenian Question, in the chapter Conflict. Trauma and Objectivity, attacks Professor Vahakn Dadrian, Richard Falk, Professor of International Law and Practice at Princeton University, and Dr. Roger Smith, Professor of Government at the College of William and Mary, for closing the door to almost a thousand years of Armenian-Turkish relations, most of which, whether acknowledged or not by professors Dadrian, Smith and Falk, had been amicable, even brotherly. He cynically continues, None of the three writers presents a combination of interrelated factors. Scholars are not only expected to keep in mind opposing views, but also to utilize interdisciplinary approaches. The final judgment in history, especially in a very controversial case like Armenian-Turkish conflict, cannot be surrendered to an ethnic participant in a dispute. In most cases, one side will be painted as an idealized white, and the other as a gruesome black. Yet Professor Ataov contradicts himself by portraying Armenian arguments false and Turkish counter arguments as a fact. Professor Ataov quotes psychoanalyst Erik Erikson as saying that We cannot leave history entirely to no clinical observers and to professional historians who often too nobly immerse themselves into the very disguises, rationalizations, and idealizations of the historical process from which it should be their business to separate themselves. Yet Professor Ataov and all Turkish deniers are doing exactly that: rationalizing and justifying the Ottoman leaders' decisions to deport all the Ottoman Armenian citizens under worse circumstances, resulting in their methodical and systematical destruction and annihilation. ATAOV & VOLKAN Ataov also quotes a famous Turkish psychiatrist, and a member of the now defunct TARC, Vamyk D. Volkan, as saying that People sometimes have a psychological investment in the continuation of a given conflict, and they actually use it as an external stabilizer of their sense of identity and inner control. Not only they do have an investment in the continuation of this enmity, but their militancy pertly marks their internal conflicts. He again quotes Volkan, saying Since they need the enemy, they are afraid to lose it. It is amazing that a scientist and psychiatrist like Volkan Vamyk allows himself to serve Turkish foreign policy objectives and the Armenian Genocide denial, misusing the science of psychology to accuse Armenians of suffering from an imaginary self-persecution syndrome; he uses the term chosen trauma to refer to the mental representation of an event that causes a group to feel victimized. The group mythologizes an event, and draws it into identity, passing the mental representation, along with associated feelings and defenses, from generation to generation. He continues, Groups also have chosen glories, which are also part of their identity. For some Armenians, these glories may be how a handful of them stood up against the attacks of so many, how they drove their enemies back, inflicting heavy losses on them, how they contributed to the victory of freedom and democracy or how modest and humanitarian they were while there were no limits to the cruelty of their enemies. Both Professors Turkkaya Ataov and Vamyk Volkan seem to be accusing the wrong parties for conducting the above-mentioned deceptive tactics, policies, actions and denials. In fact, false accusations, along with fabrications of the historical accounts, are in conformity with the Turkish psychic and mentality. PUTS STRESS ON POSITIVE According to Suleyman Seyfi Ogun's article called Facing Original Sin or Realities: Mediations on the Armenian Genocide, he claims that it is more useful to emphasize the positive aspect of the Turkish-Armenian relations, stating that for the past ten centuries (from the time of Seljuk domination) both nations lived side by side in harmony and peace and shared a similar culture, and Armenians occupied special privileged positions in the Empire. Then, in his conclusion, he continues, What happened in 1915 is beyond the limits of this article. Furthermore, the author does not believe in the validity of documents wars. Each new document will do nothing other than sharpen the existing hostile feelings of both sides. He adds, What the author has tried to postulate here is not to search for excuses but to direct the attention of both sides to an almost all-forgotten history, which has enabled us to live in peace for six centuries (from the time of Ottoman domination). The knowledge of how two peoples mutually throttled each other is useless but the knowledge of how we lived in peace is priceless. His offers are less dogmatic and somehow differ from those Turkish nationalist views, when he says, Let us put aside the mentality of the children of the Original Sin and leave them alone. We should not forget that coordinated reasoning of civilian histories has generated much more positive results then one-sided political judgments.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-11-30,1
"Right after the 1918 armistice, the perpetrators, organizers and executioners of the Armenian Genocide, in order to save face, created the myth of Armenian insurrection and the terrorism theory. Throughout the years they perfected a denial policy, while rationalizing and justifying the 1915 deportations, and ascribing the Armenian death and suffering to the ongoing imaginary civil was between Armenian and Muslim combatants; they added that most deaths were the result of starvation, disease and weather conditions. They are trying to mislead world public opinion, stating that the 1915 events were not organized or preplanned by the ottoman authorities; rather it was a wartime response by the Sublime Port, to relocate the rebellious Armenian population to the interior, far from the war zones, to secure the safety of the Ottoman Army, which was fighting against the invading Russians led by Armenian collaborators and volunteers. They postulate that it was a matter of state security to take the necessary defensive measures, while acknowledging that there may have been 300,000 to 600,000 Armenians and more than 1 million Muslims that fell victims. OMER IZGI Before reviewing the specific Turkish charges of terrorism against Armenians, it will be useful to examine the attitudes of the contemporary Turkish strategists and policy makers regarding the 1915 events and Turkish-Armenian relations. Omer Izgi, Speaker of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey and a practicing barrister, in his article Turks and Armenians: The Ottoman Experience, states: If one seeks to characterize the six-hundred-year history of the Ottoman Empire, to define the Ottoman tradition relative to their treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, the first word that comes to mind is toleration. In his analysis he further states: This policy of toleration was not without its costs, and he bluntly continues, Had the Ottomans followed a policy of forced assimilation and forced religious conversion - as they are mistakenly portrayed in much of Western literature as having done - they would have eliminated those very seeds of destruction that were fanned in the 19th century by currents of nationalism which emerged from the French Revolution. He elaborates further: Stated differently, had they (Ottomans) not guaranteed religious freedom to all the subject peoples and, instead, followed a policy of forced conversion to Islam, by the beginning of the 19th century there would have been a band of Turkish-speaking Muslims stretching from the shores of the Adriatic Sea to the Indian Ocean. In his further analysis he states: Was there no Ottoman guilt in the resulting fate of the Anatolian Armenians? Perhaps, there was. But not the guilt of having designed and carried out a planned 'genocide' of their Armenian citizens; it was the guilt of not having been able to protect all Ottoman citizens, including all Muslim groups, during the carnage of the WWI. CONFESSION, THEN CYNICISM In uncharacteristic Turkish confession, he adds, Certainly, in retrospect, it is easy to fault the Ottomans for having ordered the relocation of several hundred thousand Armenian civilians at the time when they had neither manpower nor resources to ensure that they safely reached their intended destinations. Likewise, they can be faulted for having embroiled the Ottoman State in a world war without having the necessary means at their disposal to ensure that hundreds of thousands of Muslim and Christian inhabitants alike were fed, were not subject to cholera and typhus epidemics, etc. However, in retrospect, one thing is clear: enormous numbers of combatants lost their lives in the years between 1915 and 1923. Characteristic of Turkish cynicism, he postulates, One cannot focus only on the sufferings of the Armenians while totally ignoring the fate of the Muslims. In order to mislead his readers, he deliberately fails to mention the fact that Muslim (combined Turk, Kurd, Circassian, Laz, Turkmen, and Arab) casualties were the direct result of a war between the combating forces of the Ottoman, Russian, and British Imperial Armies, and the Armenian casualties were a direct result of deliberate ethnic eradication and cleansing policy of the Ottoman state. Along the lines of the Genocide deniers, he repeats the same allegation that Eastern Anatolia in 1915 was torn by rebellion on the part of large numbers of native Armenians who actively collaborated with the invading Russian enemy. With neither modern means of transport, communication or supply at hand, it was easy for officials living in Istanbul to fall back on the traditional Ottoman policy of surgun, forced relocation, as a solution to a political problem. Surprisingly, he acknowledges that relocation or deportation orders were taken for political considerations, not necessarily for military and security reasons. In a stunning confession, he admits, The founders of the Turkish Republic were neither uninformed about nor insensitive to the events of the last quarter of the 19th century and the second year of WWI. The revolutionary leadership, with its motto of 'Peace at home, peace in the world', simply stressed the future, not the past. The past that the Turks don't want to remember, and don't want the world to talk about. NEJAT GOYUNC According to the editor's note, Nejat Goyunc, Professor of History, takes up an often-neglected aspect of Armenian-Turkish relations, namely their cultural interactions throughout the centuries, stretching back even to the pre-Ottoman period. He praises those Armenian writers, poets, artists, musicians, troubadours, architects, artisans and journalists for their contributions to Ottoman culture and life. After this opening statement, he paints a picture of happy Armenians prospering and enriching themselves under the Ottoman rule. He is trying to impress and mislead foreign observers regarding Turkish-Armenian relations, by stating that Concrete evidence of such close cultural interaction helps to draw an image quite distinct from, and even contrary to, the superficial but more widespread image of the so-called 'terrible Turks' or 'meek Armenians,' but offers a wealth of clues to the two peoples who may be described as brothers of centuries, expressed through daily life no less than numerous edicts, throughout the overwhelming part of the history of our relations, in the multi-religious, multi-ethnic and multi-racial Ottoman atmosphere. Yet, he conveniently ignores the very fact that more than 3000 Armenian churches and monuments have been deliberately destroyed throughout Anatolia, and the use of the work Armenian in Eastern Anatolia is close to committing treachery against the state. YILMAZ OZTUNA According to the editor's note, Yilmaz Oztuna, the author of voluminous works on general history, highlights the political milieu when the Armenian Question became more or less internationalized. Its starting point, according to Yilmaz, is naturally the 1877-78 Ottoman-Russian War and its dismal consequence for the defeated Turks. The Armenians, as well as the Turks, felt that the 'psychological tent' of the hitherto largely secure Ottoman state was shaken badly. Part of the Armenian leadership started to reach for new alternatives of security, and even survival. Their search, increasingly through foreign support and resort to arms, for an independent or autonomous administration on land where the Armenians formed only a minority, eventually led to clashes with the government and the Muslims forming the majority in the same area. HUSEYIN CELIK These high-caliber Turkish Foreign Ministry and State Security functionaries, with their impeccable English and cynical analytical minds, are very impressive when it comes to twisting, molding, formulating and tailoring Celik, a member of the Turkish Parliament from Van and a former associate professor of literature, relates the fateful events in Van, in the crucial year of 1915, on the basis of accounts furnished by surviving Turkish eyewitnesses. He repeats like a parrot that Armenians committed treachery against the state, engaging in terrorist activities, collaborating with the Russian army and carrying out an uprising in the province of Van. He concludes: It should not be overlooked that the Armenian use of arms was not a response to an order to resettle them elsewhere; quite the contrary, it was their insurgence and onslaught on other groups of Ottoman citizens that set in motion the process of relocation. What a well-crafted lie! The besieged people of Van, well aware of the fate of the Armenian deportees from Bitlis, Diyarbekir, Erzincan, Erzurum, Kayseri, Malatya, Mush, Sivas, Tokat, Trabzon, Yozgat and other places, knew that the only way to survive was to resort to self-defense against the overwhelming firepower of the Ottoman Army which surrounded the city and threatened them. YUUF HALACOGLU Yusuf Halacoglu is like the rest of the Genocide deniers who justify the decision to relocate Armenians and claim that necessary precautions were taken by the Ottoman authorities to prevent abuses against deportees, which could not be totally prevented. He arbitrarily and one-sidedly determines the absence of will on the part of the Ottoman state and government to annihilate any Armenian group. He claims that the Ottoman court tried and convicted those Turkish functionaries guilty of criminal acts. GUNDUZ AKTAN Gunduz Aktan, another functionary of the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Security Services, argues that The Armenians should be described as a political group deeply involved in armed revolt. The Ottoman government entertained no notion of exterminating its minority. General war conditions, hostile climate, and rampant contagious disease took many Armenian and Turkish lives. He continues, The obvious impotence of the disintegrating state cannot be described as an intention or even neglect of duties. It was none other than the Ottoman courts that convicted 1397 persons, a great majority of whom received capital punishment. He conveniently forgets that those convicted Turks were only henchmen working under the directive of the Ottoman government; they were executed not for their crimes, but in order to cover up the big crime and not explicitly implicate the Ottoman hierarchy for preplanning and giving the orders to annihilate the Armenian population. Gunduz Aktan cynically concludes, The resettlement cannot be made to fit the Genocide Convention. Characteristic of Turkish deniers, he states Historical studies are essential to render understandable the incidents that took place in the second decade of the 20th century. However, genocide, as an international crime, can be determined only by jurists on the basis of the prescribed legal criteria. He shamelessly postulates, According to the 1648 Westphalian system, state sovereignty was an absolute principle essential and supreme. The matter of minorities was an internal affair for the states, which applied domestic laws to the incidents that occurred within the country. The concept of international crime did not exist. He is trying to say that Armenian issues were an internal problem and the Ottoman government had every legal right and authority to relocate and deport them based on prevailing international law at that time. Therefore, he argues, retrospective application of the UN Convention for the Crime of the Genocide cannot be applied to the events that occurred three decades prior to its adoption. CHARGES OF TERRORISM After reviewing the rationalization and justification arguments of the Turkish scholars, academicians and policy makers, it is clear that they are falsely blaming Armenians with terrorism, in order to deflect attention from Ottoman and Turkish state terrorism. Studying the works of Turkish reactionaries like Turkkaya Ataov, Bilal Simsir, Najat Goyunc, Kamura Gurun, Yusuf Halacoglu, Kemal Oke, Sinasi Orel, Salahi Sonyel, Surreya Yuca, Ozdem Sanberk, Gunduz Aktan, Omer Izgi, Omer Lutem and many others, one realizes that they are studying Turkish-Armenian relations in order to shift the guilt from being the perpetrators to the victims. Turkish publications listing the sequence of events from 1876 to 1923 as to how Armenian terrorists staged insurrections and assassinated Ottoman leaders. They also list numerous terrorist incidents and assassinations of Turkish diplomats from 1973 to 1985 and finally from 1991 to present, when Armenians supposedly conducted terrorism against the Republic of Azerbaijan. Alleged terrorism charges are discussed under the chapters of Armenian Terror, Armenia and Terrorism, PKK-Armenian Relations, The Armenian Terrorist Organizations, The Tashnak Terrorist organization, The ASALA Terrorist Organization, JCAG Terrorist Organization, and The ARA Terrorist Organization.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-11-23,1
"ANKARA, Turkey - A Greek Orthodox delegation from the United States met with Turkish foreign ministry officials on October 21 to lobby for the reopening of a Greek Orthodox theological school which the Turkish Government shut down in 1971. After meeting with officials at the Turkish Foreign Ministry in Ankara, Dr. Anthony Limberakis, National Commander of the Order of Saint Andrew - Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, said I think that, in the interest of theological education, opening the school of Halki would be a positive thing for everybody. Asked how Turkish officials responded, Dr. Limberakis said they understand our position as concerned Orthodox Christians of America. Turkish officials were not immediately available for comment, but the fact that Turkish authorities have refused to allow the academy to reopen, Dr. Limberakis explained, is actually a violation of American citizens' religious rights. The fact that we can not educate our priests at the Theological Academy of Halki is a violation of the rights of (Greek Orthodox) American citizens. When the Ecumenical Patriarchate can not exercise its rights as owner of its property, it is a violation of our rights as American citizens, he said. What is really the fear of Ankara's bureaucrats? We grow truly weary of seeing the leader of international Orthodoxy to be treated as a second-class citizen. It is an injustice that mortgages democracy and human rights in a country that has been a friend of the United States for the last 50 years, he added. On October 22, the delegation paid a visit to Heybeli (Halki) island off the coast at Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where the seminary is located. US Ambassador to Turkey W. Robert Pearson also called on Turkey to permit the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which is based in Constantinople, to reopen the Halki Theological Academy. I would like to reiterate the United States' support for the reopening of the Theological School of Halki as an independent educational institution that belongs exclusively to the Patriarchate, Mr. Pearson said after his visit to the Halki with the US delegation of Archons and His All Holiness Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew. The U.S. continues to encourage Turkey, as a friend and ally, to once again allow light to shine from Halki, Mr. Pearson said, adding that the reopening of the Halki Academy will be a shining example for Europe and America and elsewhere, of Turkey's commitment to the international principles of freedom and tolerance. Mr. Pearson also called Halki a beacon of faith, brotherhood, peace, tolerance and love. It sends light from this small corner of Turkey to the four corners of the Earth. Upon welcoming Mr. Pearson and the Archons delegation, His All Holiness said We call out, in the name of democracy, in the name of civilization, in the name of human rights and especially religious freedom. We call again and again on the authorities of the country and its government to provide us with the ability to reopen the Theological School of Halki. The reopening of the school has become a symbol of religious freedom, a symbol of respect for human rights, a symbol for the rights of minorities. But the functioning of this school is also a necessity for the present and future of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Turkey, a predominantly Muslim country, is under increasing international pressure to reopen the Halki Greek Orthodox Theological School, which it closed under a law that put military and religious education under state control. The European Union, which Turkey aspires to join, has also called on Turkey to reopen the seminary. The Ecumenical Patriarchate in Constantinople dates from the Greek Orthodox Byzantine Empire, which collapsed when the Ottoman Turks conquered the city in 1453. Constantinople was the capital of the Empire, and thus the heart of Greek culture for more than 1,000 years. Although few Greek Orthodox Christians remain in overwhelmingly Muslim Turkey, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is still based in Istanbul and has jurisdiction over several Greek Orthodox Churches around the world.

"On Sunday October 6, the New York Times published an editorial which maintains that, if the Turkish Government is to be truly democratic, Turkey's ubiquitous military needs to be brought under civilian rule. The editorial, Double Talk on Democracy, described the Bush Administration's call for regime change in Iraq, with respect to the purpose of promoting democracy in that nation, is hypocritical because there are other countries like Turkey where the ground for democracy is more fertile. Washington's democracy agenda must not begin and end with Iraq, the editorial argues, adding that the United States could easily help shift the country's political balance toward civilian rule, but declines to do so. The editorial, which states the newspaper's official position, said Turkey is the most striking example of Washington's hypocrisy and devotes most of its 627-word space to explaining why this is the case. The entire text of the editorial follows: The Bush Administration likes to say that the establishment of a democratic government in Iraq could be a model for political reform in the Islamic world. That is no doubt true, and it is a desirable objective. Unfortunately, while the United States is preparing to fight a war in Iraq, in part to achieve that goal, it is doing little to address undemocratic practices nearly everywhere else in the region. Washington's democracy agenda must not begin and end with Iraq, where political life has been stunted by dictators for decades. Other predominantly Muslim countries (e.g., Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco, Kuwait, Bahrain and Egypt) offer more fertile ground, with important elements of democratic culture and politics already in place. Turkey, Iraq's northern neighbor, is the most striking example of Washington's hypocrisy. With a little help from the United States, Turkey could be the shining example that the White House imagines Iraq can become if Saddam Hussein exits. In many respects, Turkey already resembles a Western democracy, with regular elections, a secular constitution, civil rights for women and a lively independent press. But its democratic institutions remain warped by the influence of a meddling, authoritarian military leadership. The United States, Turkey's most influential ally, could easily help shift the country's political balance toward civilian rule, but declines to do so. The reason is no secret. Turkey's armed forces have long provided Washington with valuable military bases. During the cold war, Turkey offered proximity to the Soviet Union. Today, it provides air access to northern Iraq. Washington regularly sides with Turkey's generals over its democrats, especially when the generals claim to be defending secularism against elected Islamic politicians. Last month, under pressure from the military, Turkey's highest electoral authority banned Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the country's most popular political party, from running in this fall's parliamentary election. At a political rally five years ago, when Mr. Erdogan was mayor of Istanbul, he recited a combative poem which advocated the advancement of the Islamic faith in Turkish society. The verse was ruled a crime, inciting religious hatred, and Mr. Erdogan was convicted and stripped of his political rights. Although Mr. Erdogan's party had been leading by a wide margin in the polls, he is now ineligible to serve as Turkey's next prime minister, even if his party comes in first. It is hard to see how excluding the leader of a party favored by nearly a quarter of the voters strengthens democracy. Yet Washington failed to deliver a suitably strong protest. Five years ago, the Turkish military similarly forced the ouster of another democratic Islamic politician, Necmettin Erbakan, as prime minister. It has also pressured civilian governments to support harshly repressive policies against Turkey's large Kurdish minority, measures which have led to the jailing of elected leaders and journalists. If the Administration is truly interested in promoting democracy, it will also tell Pakistan's military dictator, General Pervez Musharraf, that it will no longer wink at his constitutional manipulations and fraudulent electoral exercises. It should increase its pressure on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to free Saad Eddin Ibrahim and other democracy advocates, end his intimidation of independent news media and permit genuinely free elections. For Americans, the events of last September 11 underscored the dangers of embracing pro-Western autocrats in the Islamic world without regard for how they rule at home. If the Administration is prepared to send Americans into combat to advance the cause of democracy in Iraq, surely it can press harder for reform in countries where democracy can be promoted in far less costly ways.",NA,Hellenic Times,2002-11-07,1
"It is long overdue for the U.S. government to understand that realist political thinking does not mandate that every thug in the universe, at one time or another, has to be an American bedfellow. Most of these bedfellows are similar to prostitutes - they can be bought and most could carry an incurable contagion. The disease that is excessively debilitating in international politics is the erosion of the country's leadership by setting a poor example. Most sensible people understand that Saddam Hussein will not win a Mr. Congeniality contest. The man is a thug, a murderer and a menace. But let us momentarily consider how this man ascended to a position where he is a bane to human dignity and worth. Some 20 years ago, Ronald Regan made the decision that Iraq had to defeat the Muslim Republic of Iran in the war being fought between those two nations. Iran had held U.S. diplomats hostage for 444 days. The Iranian revolutionaries who ousted another thug, the Shah(with whom the U.S. shared a bed against the USSR), had spat upon and burned anything that symbolized America, most notably the flag. The Muslim revolutionary bosses in Iran threatened American interests in the Middle East DIFFICULT DECISIONS It is a given that often very difficult decisions have to be made in international politics. However, when the U.S. made the decision to throw in with Saddam Hussein, the Israelis had already taken out, with pre-emptive strikes, Mr. Hussein's nuclear reactor at Osirak. American intelligence had a dossier that also spelled out in very simple English Saddam Hussein's inhumanity and the fact that he had real designs on building chemical, biological, and worst of all, nuclear weapons. The U.S. did not place the dictator in power. Iraq was topsy-turvy in the 1960's and 70's. Mr. Hussein played his cards correctly and gained the ruling seat in Baghdad. Further, the USSR was courting the Iraqi strongman and the U.S. decided that if Iraq fell under Moscow's sway, surely Middle East oil would follow. It was not lost upon the astute observer that Iraq had untapped oil wealth second only to Saudi Arabia. Saddam Hussein was seen as the lesser of two evils. Thus, the brain trust that consisted partly of the current policy drafters, Richard Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle selected Saddam Hussein as an ally. For five years, until Iran capitulated in the war with Iraq, the U.S. provided Baghdad with military intelligence that pinpointed Iran's military formations, handed Iraq economic aid, and doled out military aid beyond accounting. IGNORING BASIC DECENCY It is one thing to help defeat the perceived greater evil, and another for the U.S. to divorce itself from basic decency, even for a righteous reason. The U.S. helped Iraq then by postulated principles of decency that are currently being used against Iraq. The 1980's brain trust knowingly allowed Iraq's Nuclear Energy Commission access to bacteria cultures that might be used in production of biological weapons. In fact, in Baghdad in 1983, Mr. Rumsfeld had his picture taken shaking hands with the very same Mr. Hussein he now wants eliminated. During that visit with Saddam Hussein, Mr. Rumsfeld did warn the dictator that if he used chemical agents against Iran, it might inhibit American help. Knowing Mr. Rumsfeld's, and indeed Washington's, realist disposition, Saddam Hussein threw the inane and meaningless warning into the trash. That the Iraqi dictator read Mr. Rumsfeld correctly was reinforced by the invaluable military intelligence information that was later funneled to Baghdad. Almost concomitantly, the U.S. secretly arranged to ship tanks and other war fighting equipment to Egypt, which in turn, provided those same supplies to Iraq. Under the guise of assisting Egypt, the U.S. hoodwinked the American taxpayer with masked aid to Iraq. And we continue to play these games through NATO with other bedfellows, most notably Turkey. Currently, the U.S. government makes a solid case against Saddam Hussein about his use of gas against the Kurds. The entire world is justifiably horrified each time they view the photos of innocent dead Kurds in Halabja at the hands of a person who knows no bounds to his anger. However, gassing the Kurds was not a new revelation in Washington as to the degrees of depravity to which Mr. Hussein would stoop. The American leaders knew that, between 1983 and 1988, Mr. Hussein had used chemicals 195 times against Iranians, killing as many, if not more, innocent Iranians than ethnic Kurds. The big difference to the realist ideologues that still form U.S. military policy is that Iran was the enemy and Iraq was a bedfellow; immorality, violations of the Geneva Convention and any semblance of human decency be damned. SAME HOGWASH The same crew that fed hogwash to the American public about Iraq in the 1980s is doing the same thing now about Pakistan and Turkey. Pervez Musharraf, the general-dictator of Pakistan, had the al-Qaeda as his allies for years. But when the terrorists attacked the U.S., after some deliberation, the wise general who was desperately seeking the good graces of Washington turned on his former allies and helped to hunt them. Without question this was good for the U.S. But the audacity to propagate the vision that the dictator has suddenly turned into a democrat and disavows terrorism is as blatantly a fabrication as having hailed Saddam Hussein as an American friend. The general needed U.S. assistance to delay the possible nuclear showdown with India. He understood that a war with its neighbor could be his downfall. Thus, he put on his mask as an anti-terrorist, while at the same time encouraging terrorists to raise havoc in contested Kashmir. This thug, who has already seen to it that he will win in the next round of presidential elections, is not opposed to terrorism in principle, but is resistant to using it against certain powers, particularly those that could inflict damage upon his longevity as the Pakistani boss. When he wins the election, Paul Wolfowitz, et al, will probably smile and reaffirm that he was correct in stating that with American leadership Pakistan turned into a democratic stronghold. This is what the great sage in the Pentagon is harking for Afghanistan. It matters not that General Musharraf visited Baku and told the Azerbaijan strongman that Pakistan is ready to assist Azerbaijan in whatever it takes to defeat the Armenians if another war comes over Karabagh. It matters not to Mr. Wolfowitz that Pakistan and Afghanistan had already sent Mujahaddein to fight against the Armenians, only to discover that it did not make too much difference in the outcome of the battles. So long as Musharraf does not send his terrorists and hoods against the U.S., all else is forgiven. That is, if or until a better deal comes along and Mr. Musharraf discovers that the U.S. is no longer a friend. This may come as soon as the U.S. is honest enough to see its own intelligence findings that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence Agency (ISI) orchestrates militancy and directed terror, that they are reluctant to stop, and they did not prevent the most extreme terrorists of al Qaeda from finding safe havens in Pakistan. DOING THE SAME FOR TURKEY The U.S. has been doing the same for Turkey for decades. Let us see what happens if the Senate has the courage not to pass legislation that will give Turkey more free trade accessibility. The U.S. has turned a blind eye toward Turkey's illicit trade with Iraq that has already reached pre-Gulf-War levels. Yet, Paul Wolfowitz and clan have the temerity to tell the U.S. public what a great ally Turkey has been and how it has sacrificed for democratic principles. Take away the billions of dollars in favors from the U.S. and then evaluate how sincere the war against terrorism outside their own borders is in Ankara. Turkey is neither secular, nor a democracy. It uses terrorism against ethnic groups that are not viewed as fortunate enough to be called Turks. The difference is that the terrorism is state employed, thereby making it acceptable. This is not a call for the U.S. to abandon the effort to seek assistance from these thugs in extreme circumstances. But every one of them need the U.S. more than the U.S. needs them, or at a minimum, equally as much as the U.S. needs their assistance. But if they get in bed with prostitutes, even temporarily, the U.S. government should require that they clean up and do what is necessary to obtain the correct prescriptions to cure their ills. If the U.S. had done this with Turkey years ago, Washington would not be at odds today with the EU because they have not allowed Turkey into the EU. Not only has the U.S. meddled in internal EU affairs, which has angered even close European friends, Washington has become a laughing stock in many European capitals. The U.S. has been branded a hypocrite in a steadily increasing unfriendly Middle East, even with a Saddam Hussein.","Mooradian, Moorad",Armenian Reporter International,2002-11-02,1
"American Taliban member John Walker Lindh's first trip abroad was to Ireland in 1998, and the visit had a profound impact on his life. In an exclusive interview, SEAN O'DRISCOLL talks to John's father Frank Lindh about his controversial son's love of Ireland and its people. ON the day the Good Friday Agreement was signed in 1998, a young American Muslim named John Walker Lindh was driving around the Donegal Gaeltacht, trying to learn Irish from Radio na Gaeltachta. Later that day, dressed in his Muslim head cap and flowing robe, he toasted the Agreement with elderly relatives in the Glenties in Donegal. A strict adherent to Islamic faith, he politely declined any alcohol. His mother's elderly cousin studied his dress for a moment and beckoned him forward. What religion are you? she said softly. You're not a Catholic. John's father Frank Lindh throws his head back and laughs. He is sitting in the lounge of a hotel in Alexandria, Virginia, on Monday evening, a short walk from where his son was jailed for 20 years only three days previously. He is in remarkable good mood, having just visited John with his daughter, Naomi. John is in good spirits too, he told the Irish Voice. They really respect him there in the prison and he's still got that same sense of humor. Even his letters are very funny, he's got a great dry wit that you don't come across in the news reports. I wish people could know my son before they make their assumptions. A highly respected and well-paid San Francisco lawyer, Frank is traveling under an assumed name. He is dressed in stonewashed jeans, sneakers and a t-shirt, and hasn't been recognized all evening. Out on the streets, he is often approached by strangers. It's all been very positive but it's still very strange, he says. I have to adjust to this, and so will all the family. John has already accepted that he will always be known by all of this. JOHN Walker Lindh's fate as one of the most controversial Americans of all time was sealed, in many ways, by his trip to Donegal. The trip to Ireland was John's first time abroad, says Frank. It gave him great confidence and a yearning to see more of the world. It made him see that there was more to life than America and he wanted to see it. Within months of the visit, John had booked a ticket to Yemen to study at an Islamic school. He learned Arabic and moved to Pakistan, where he signed up to join the Taliban, then fighting with the Northern Alliance for control of Afghanistan. The Ireland holiday was my way of showing John his cultural history, and it has a profound effect on both of us, says Frank. I wasn't trying to show John that he was Irish Catholic and not Muslim, because I was proud that he was making his own spiritual connections. In many ways, the holiday in Ireland strengthened John's beliefs. It centered him and made him stronger. The pair first visited Dublin, where John's unusual dress attracted the attention of many passersby. The only place we could get something to eat was in a pub in Temple Bar, recalls Frank. Two kids came over and one asks John if he dresses like that all the time, and the other comes over and says, `Are you in a play or somethin'?' They went on walking trips around the city center, one time past a butcher's shop in downtown Dublin when Frank asked John to pose for a photo. He stood there without realizing the word `pork' was in large letters right behind him. He thought it was funny even though I was making fun of his beliefs a little bit, Frank recalls. In deference to John's religion, Frank decided not to take a tour of the Guinness brewery when they went on a bus tour around the city center. I also missed out on the Bushmills distillery in Northern Ireland, he adds with a smile. The pair traveled to Belfast at John's request. He was very interested in the Northern Ireland situation, said Frank. But John's interest wasn't in the politics but in the people, an interest he had kept all his life. They stayed in a hotel in downtown Belfast, but Frank stayed up most of the night listening to the sound of gunfire. He was concerned for John, who was sleeping soundly near the window. It was only when he got to Donegal that he discovered the gunfire had come from a country and western theme night held in a nightclub near the hotel. I felt so stupid, I should have known better, Frank says with a laugh. John thought it was hilarious. The pair traveled through the picturesque mountains of west Donegal, John tuning into various Irish language programs and trying to pronounce some words. That was a huge fascination for him, recalls Frank. He was surprised that there were news programs and even talk shows with people phoning in. He was always very interested in languages, and he wanted to know more about it. The family of Frank's mother, Kathy Maguire, had emigrated to Philadelphia in October 1929, when she was only six years old. Some of her family were close friends of the playwright, Brian Friel, who based many of his plays in the Glenties. There is a strong connection between that part of Donegal and Philadelphia - you see it in Friel's play Philadelphia, Here I Come, said Frank. As someone who grew up in Philadelphia, it was very important to come back to Donegal and meet our relatives. It had a profound effect on both of us. After a quick drive down to Shannon, he and John headed back to the U.S., where John soon began making plans to travel to the Middle East. NEARLY four years later, Frank heard the awful news that his son had almost died in ferocious fighting in Afghanistan. He had been shot in the thigh, after spending a week in a dark flood cellar while Northern Alliance troops fired through the ventilation shafts. John instantly became a national hate figure and his family was vilified in the national press. Frank had a weekend to think. On the following Monday, he contacted Irish American lawyer James Brosnahan, who had once represented the other side in a court case. I knew his name, and I knew I wanted him as John's lawyer. Meanwhile he had been looking at the TV footage and thinking, `God, this kid needs a lawyer.' The media had already rushed to the San Francisco and D.C suburbs to interview anyone who had ever known American's number 1 news story. The Lindh family believed that the interest might fade over time, but it never did. In post-September 11 America, the public wanted to know why an American teenager with no Muslim connections would suddenly run off and join the Taliban. Frank was particularly stung by a Time magazine article that he had hoped would finally tell the truth. It was below tabloid, he said. I trusted that journalist and did everything I could to help, but a lot of the U.S media want a caricature of my son, nothing more. To the teeth-grinding annoyance of conservative America, Frank is proud of his son. He is a great guy and, after all he has been through, he can still make me laugh. I am very proud that he went to the Middle East and did what he believed was right. Even if that meant fighting for a system that denigrated women? He had no business being in Afghanistan, he accepts that, Frank says quickly. But he was going and he believed he was correct by his religion - stopping Northern Alliance troops from raping and pillaging the country. John felt that order had to be better than mass rape and murder. But he didn't agree with all of Taliban society -- it is not his overall view of how society should be run. He is very proud of John's statement to the court last Friday, in which he said he understood America's anger, denounced killing civilians, and accept what he had done was wrong.

"Povist Vremennykh Lit (PVL) relates that in 941: Ihor attacked the Greeks (Byzantine Empire) ... with [a fleet of] 10,000 vessels. The Rus' ravaged the countryside around the capital of Constantinople committing many atrocities, burning churches, monasteries and villages, and taking no little booty ... Then, when the [relief] army came out of the east ... [they] surrounded the Rus'. After taking counsel, the latter threw themselves upon the Greeks, and as the conflict between them was desperate, the Greeks experienced difficulty in winning the upper hand. The Rus' returned at evening to their companions, embarked at night upon their vessels, and fled away. Theophanes pursued them in boats with Greek fire, and dropped it through pipes upon the Russian ships, so that a strange miracle was offered to view. Upon seeing the flames, the Rus' cast themselves into the sea-water, being anxious to escape, but the survivors returned home. When they came once more to their native land, where each one recounted to his kinfolk the course of events and described the fire launched from the ships, they related that the Greeks had in their possession the lightning from heaven, and had set them on fire by pouring it forth, so that the Rus' could not conquer them. 21 21 PVL, pp. 71-72. The Byzantines acquired the knowledge of this terror weapon sometime between 670 and 680 from a discontented Muslim defector who became the empire's petroleum consultant. He taught the Byzantines the formula for a petroleum mixture that would burn even in water. The Byzantine navy then built large siphons onto the bows of their ships to squirt the liquid. With this new armament they were able to break a seven-year Muslim seige of Constantinople in 680 by burning the entire Muslim flotilla at the Battle of Kyzikos. More details about this erroneously called Greek fire may be found in Zayn Bilkadi's article The Oil Weapons, Aramco World, Vol. 46, No. 1 (January-February 1995), pp. 20-27. A number of other writings corroborate details of this attack and provide further information. Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r. 945-959) records a fairly detailed account of the assault in his De Administrando Imperio, while passing references appear in the Vita Basilii Iunioris of Gregory the Monk 22 and in an emperor's private letter. 23 Another account is given by Liudprand of Cremona, whose stepfather visited Constantinople not long after the attack. According to Liudprand, the Rus' led by a king named Inger (Ihor) leading a fleet of 1,000 or more appeared unexpectedly in June of 941 and devastated the coastal areas around the city. The tide was turned by bringing out of mothballs 15 battered old galleys and rigging them fore, aft and sides with devices for projecting the Greek fire. Rus' boats swarmed about the galleys, which began to project their fire all around; and the Rus', seeing the flames, hurled themselves from their boats, preferring death by water to live incineration. Some sank to the bottom under the weight [of their armor] ... others caught fire even as they were swimming among the billows. The Rus' fleet retreated to the safety of the shallows, out of reach of the Byzantine army on land and the navy's heavier-draft ships in deeper water. The two sides continued to harass each other in a number of fairly small-scale land engagements, which proved inconclusive but prevented the raiders from gaining the overall initiative. The Rus' remained in the area until September before retiring. 24 22 Gregory the Monk, Vita Basilii Iunioris, ed. A. N.

Darvouzes, Epistoliers Byzantins du X Siecle (Archives de l'Orient Chretien 6; Paris, 1960), pp. 322.15. 24 The Works of Liudprand of Cremona (London, 1930), pp. 185-186. This account verifies that Ihor's attack of 941 was in the form of a major expedition, although Liudprand's figure of about 1,000 ships is certainly closer to the truth than the PVL's exaggerated 10,000. The counterattack using Greek fire was crippling and did provide the means by which the Byzantines held back the invasion. Yet, the victory was apparently not as complete as the PVL relates, since the Rus' hung on and did not immediately retreat. Amazingly, the attack of 941 is briefly described in still one more source from that time. A mid-10th century Khazar document (sometimes termed the Schechter text), recounts events of the recent past and mentions a Rus' expedition against Constantinople, lasting four months, in which the defenders were victorious by virtue of (Greek) fire. 25 The surviving Rus' are said to have fled by sea. The uncanny similarities of a naval campaign, four-month sojourn in Byzantine waters and successful defense by means of a fire weapon would all seem to indicate the same campaign as described in the PVL, Byzantine chronicles and Liudprand. One inconsistency, though, is that the king of the Rusy is named Hlgu (Helgu) or Oleh. 26 If, however, we accept that Oleh and Ihor were contemporaries who conducted joint campaigns, and that Oleh was probably a general under Ihor, then the citation is entirely compatible. 25 Golb and Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents, p. 119. 26 Golb and Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents, p. 115. The Rus' fleet returned to its point of departure on the Cimmerian Bosporus (the Strait of Kerch along eastern Crimea). 27 From there the forces presumably split, since it is reported that Oleh went east to campaign against Prs (Persia, in reality the southern Caspian shore); 28 Ihor likely returned to Kyiv. 27 Leon Diaconus Caloensis, Historiae Libri Decem, ed. C. B. Hase (Bonn, 1828), p. 106. 28 MurIj Aldahab, ed. Ch. Pellat, Vol. 1, pp. 218-212. Eng. trans. by Minorsky, A History of Sharvun and Darband, pp. 150-153. See also Golb and Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents, pp. 118-119, 138. The PVL next mentions Ihor in 944 thirsting for revenge and collecting a vast army from various Slavic tribes. His advance on Byzantium alarmed the emperor who sent out messengers to entreat Ihor to come no nearer, but rather accept a substantial tribute. Ihor conferred with this retinue and decided to accept from the Greeks gold and palls sufficient for his whole army, [he] returned again and came to Kyiv in his native land. 29 29 PVL, pp. 72-73. This second campaign against Byzantium is considered by virtually all modem investigators to be non-historical; it was clearly invented to cover up the inglorious retreat of three years previous. 30 The story served, however, as a good prelude for the events next described. 30 Hrushevsky, Istoriia Ukrainy-Rusy, I (Kyiv, 1913), p. 442-ff. A new treaty of trade The PVL for 945 reports on the negotiation and ratification of a treaty to renew and expand an earlier (911) trade agreement between Rus' and the Byzantine Empire. Since Romanus is listed as one of the Greek emperors, the talks must have begun in 944 because this ruler was deposed on December 16, 944. Nevertheless, it may not have been until the following year that the Rus' confirmed the treaty in Kyiv. The preamble of the treaty of 945 makes no reference whatsoever to a recent hostile event as one might expect if a Rus' campaign had been undertaken in 944. 31 31 PVL, p.73. The treaty is remarkable for its detail and the overall impression it gives of larger numbers of Rus' now involved in exchanges with Byzantium. Noting that Rus' agents [had] hitherto carried gold seals and the merchants silver ones as means of accreditation, the treaty stipulates that henceforth they would be provided with a certificate from their prince (Ihor) specifying how many ships had been dispatched and confirming that they were coming with peaceful intent. While this was undoubtedly a precaution against another surprise attack, it likely also reflected an increase in Rus' maritime activity. So, too, the number of names at the beginning of the documents. While the 911 treaty lists only 15 persons, the new agreement names 25 envoys and 30 merchants. 32 32 PVL, pp. 73-77. See Franklin, S. and Shepard J., The Emergence of Rus' 750-1200, pp. 117-133 for a more thorough discussion of this treaty and the expansion of Rus' commercial activity during the early and middle part of the 10th century. At the close of negotiations Ihor's agents returned to Kyiv with a number of Greek representatives. Ihor called the Greek envoys before him, and bade them report ... [they] replied, `The emperor has sent us. He loves peace, and desires to maintain concord and amity with the Prince of Rus'. Your envoys have received the pledge of our emperors, and they have sent us to receive your oath and that of your followers.' Ihor promised to comply with their request. In the morning, Ihor summoned the envoys, and went to a hill on which there was a statue of Perun. The Rus' laid down their weapons, their shields and their gold armaments, and Ihor and his people took oath (at least, such as were pagans), while the Christian Rus' took oath in the church of St. Elias ... a parish church, since many of the Varangians were Christians. Ihor, after confirming the treaty with the Greeks, dismissed their envoys, bestowing upon them furs, slaves and wax, and then sending them away. The envoys returned to the emperor, and reported all the words of Ihor and his affection for the Greeks. Thus, Ihor began to rule in Kyiv, enjoying peaceful relations with all nations. 33 33 PVL, pp. 77-78. In pre-Christian Kyivan Rus', Perun was the chief deity - the god of thunder, lightning and rain; the ruler of the heavens; and, later, the god of war. The chronicler's use of the word began is striking and was probably inadvertently left in by that writer as he was fudging the timeline for the early decades of the 10th century. What is implied by this word is that Ihor had not been ruler in Kyiv for that long a period. This statement would seem to support the revised chronology that Ihor (Figure 4) established himself in Kyiv in the 930s or early 940s and not in 913. Although ruling as king in Rus' Ihor 34 was now able to enjoy a period of tranquility, fortune was not as kind to his general, Oleh, in his eastern campaign. This venture was initially hugely successful as the Rus' fleet was able to enter the Caspian Sea and for many months during 942 terrorize the entire southern shoreline and even inland three days distance. They set themselves upon some offshore islands and raided and plundered at their leisure since the Muslims had no navy with which to oppose them (only merchants and fishermen plied the sea). Finally, in 943, laden with booty ... [they] had had enough of their adventure and attempted to leave by way of the Volga. The Rus' were met by an army of Muslims who defeated them after a three-day land battle in which Oleh and about 30,000 of his men perished. 35 34 The PVL styles him as kniaz, which is usually mistranslated as prince. In actuality the word is derived from the Germanic kuning meaning king. See Pritsak, The Origin of Rus', p. 886. Pritsak gives Ihor the title of kagan, the highest imperial title of the Eurasian steppe. See The System of Government Under Volodimer the Great and His Foreign Policy in Harvard Ukrainian Studies Vol. No. (1995), p. 574. 35 Minorsky, A History of Sharvun and Darband, pp. 150-153. Ibn-Miskawaih, The Eclipse of the Abbasid Caliphate, V, pp. 67-74; and Gold and Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents, pp. 118-119. 36 PVL, p. 78. A final campaign When Ihor heard of Oleh's demise and the defeat of his army, he chose for himself a new voyevoda, a man by the name of Sveneld. The latter was apparently a successful war leader as his followers are described as being well-outfitted: In this year (945), Ihor's retinue said to him, `The servants of Sveneld are adorned with weapons and fine rainment, but we are naked [in comparison]. Go forth with us, oh Prince, after tribute, that both you and we may profit thereby.' (Figure 5) 36 36 PVL, p. 78. Ihor's treasury was apparently very low and any hoped for replenishment had died with Oleh. So, Ihor heeded the urgings of his followers (druzhyna) and he attacked Dereva in search of tribute. He sought to increase the previous tribute and collected it by violence from the people with the assistance of his followers. After thus gathering the tribute, he returned to his city. On his homeward way, he said to his followers, after some reflection, `Go forward with the tribute. I shall turn back, and rejoin you later.' He dismissed his retainers on their journey homeward but, being desirous of still greater booty, he returned on his tracks with a few of his followers. The Derevlianians heard that he was again approaching, and consulted with Mal, their prince, saying, `If a wolf comes among the sheep, he will take away the whole flock one by one, unless he be killed. If we do not thus. kill him now, he will destroy us all.' They then sent forward to Ihor inquiring why he had returned, since he had collected all the tribute. But Ihor did not heed them, and the Derevlianians came forth from the city of Iskorosten and slew Ihor and his company, for the number of the latter was few. So Ihor was buried, and his tomb is near the city of Iskorosten in Dereva even to this day. 37 37 PVL, p. 78. Hrushevsky proposed that Ihor may not have died until 947 or 948; Istoriia Ukrainy-Rusy, p. 446. He left behind his wife, Olha, and their young son, Sviatoslav. Serving as regent, Olha would prove to be a very capable administrator of her husband's realm as we shall see in next month's Focus on Philately. An assessment A number of researchers have casually dismissed Ihor as an inept ruler, unsuccessful in his military enterprises and unpopular with his subjects. Such a characterization, however, does not at all square with his many accomplishments. A short description in the NPL that states when Ihor grew up, he came to be brave and wise is more likely nearer the mark. 38 38 Hrushevsky, Istoriia Ukrainy-Rusy, p. 446. There is no doubt that Ihor was a fine leader who commanded respect. He was able to take the city of Kyiv and firmly establish his family there - and more distant relations in other towns - so that when he died unexpectedly, the rule passed to his wife (as regent) without dispute. His reign may have lasted a decade or longer (circa 935 to 945 or a few years later). Ihor in very many ways displayed all of the typical attributes of a Varangian warlord. That he may have taken Kyiv by treachery or artifice would not reflect unfavorably with his followers. The use of sly stratagems to capture a fortress or town was looked upon with admiration by all northmen. Ihor's organization of a massive army and fleet that could threaten the very capital of the Byzantine Empire shows great skill in planning. The fact that the operation could be sustained for many months, even after setbacks with the Byzantine's secret weapon (Greek fire), reflects well on his leadership abilities. Ever the realists, Varangians would settle for acquiring goods by trade if force of arms ultimately failed. So, it is entirely within his northern character for Ihor to have negotiated a treaty of trade with Byzantium a few years after the great naval expedition. The regular flow of goods - fur, wax, honey, weapons and slaves in exchange for cloth, silks, glass, silver, spices and wines 39 would have fueled the engine of growth for the nascent Rus' state. 39 These were the main commodities of exchange. For a fuller itemization see Jones, Gwyn. A History of the Vikings (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), particularly pp. 3 and 253. In short, then, Ihor was an able and sagacious ruler who did much to fashion the foundation of medieval Kyivan Rus'. He, more than anyone, deserves to be recognized as the founding father of the Kyivan Rus' dynasty. Ingert Kuzych may be contacted at P.O.

"It has long frustrated me that so many historians, Ukrainian and otherwise, seem to accept so blindly the medieval records of early Kyivan Rus' (the first state on Ukrainian and eastern European lands). By blindly I mean that obvious inconsistencies within the earliest chronicles are parroted as if they were set in stone, without any critical examination and without searching for possible alternate sources. I have long had an interest in Ihor, my royal namesake of the 10th century (Ihor derives from Ingvar, which derives from Inger(t)), and over several years have researched and compiled his biography as well as biographies of his wife, Olha, and son, Sviatoslav. Together they form medieval Ukraine's first First Family. These biographies have been turned into the next three Focus on Philately submissions and will present a much more thorough and accurate introduction to these monarchs than what is conventionally found in textbooks. Although these articles are lengthier than my typical columns, I have tried not to make them overly specialized. It is my contention that Ihor is the true originator of the ruling Rus' lineage in Kyiv and that the name of the larger-than-life Riurik whose Riurikide appellation is given to the dynasty, should be expunged once and for all. It is almost certain that the real Riurik never visited Ukrainian lands and any Rus' territory that he may have acquired would have been in the far Baltic north, in present-day Russia. I believe that it is high time that Ukraine finally lays its rightful claim to its glorious medieval Rus' legacy by jettisoning the baggage brought on by the Riurikide label and by which Russian historians still lay claim to the Kyivan Rus' heritage. The articles in this monarch series are illustrated, where possible, with related philatelic issues. Regrettably, no stamp issue of Ihor has ever been made, but a representation of him has appeared on a postcard. Ihor: king of Kyiv, founder of dynasty Despite being the husband of St. Olha and the father of Sviatoslav the Conqueror, relatively little is known about Ihor, the head of this illustrious family and the true founder of the dynasty that would rule in Rus' for some four centuries (Figure 1). Most of the information we have about Ihor comes from the Povist Vremennykh Lit (PVL), or The Tale of Bygone Years, a valuable historical source compiled in the early 12th century according to tradition, by the monk-chronicler Nestor. The PVL is based on earlier Kyivan and Novgorodian compilations and draws on contemporary Byzantine sources and includes texts of a number of Rus' - Byzantine treaties. The Povist is quite reliable and detailed in recounting events closer in time, to its editing, but for occurrences of Ihor's time some two centuries earlier, the chronology is less trustworthy and contains some major discontinuities. 1 We are fortunate that a number of additional references in other sources help fill in some more details about Ihor. The traditional story According to the PVL, Ihor was the son of the great Varangian (Viking) leader Riurik, who had been invited to rule over Rus' lands around the year 860. 2 Riurik is almost certainly the notorious Danish Viking adventurer Rorick who set himself up in the east Baltic area at about this time. 3 The chronicles for the year 779 state that: On his deathbed, Riurik bequeathed his realm to Oleh, who belonged to his kin, and entrusted to Oleh's hands his son, Ihor, for he was very young. 4 We know from Western medieval sources, however, that the Danish King Rorick must have been born.circa 800, 5 so for him to have fathered a son just prior to his death is unlikely. Ihor is described as having played a very subordinate role to Oleh; his guardian even arranged his marriage. Little is recorded of Ihor until the entry for 903: As Ihor grew up, he followed after Oleh, and obeyed his instructions. A wife, Olha by name, was brought to him from Pskov. For 907, the chronicle states that Oleh left Ihor as ruler in Kyiv while he conducted a campaign against Byzantium. 6 Nothing more is mentioned of Ihor until 913, when the chronicles state that he succeeded Oleh and began his reign. The following year: Ihor attacked the Derevlianians, an East Slavic tribe, and after conquering them he imposed upon them a tribute larger than Oleh's. In 916 the Pechenegs, migratory Turkic tribesmen, first entered into Rus'. Ihor reached an agreement with them and they went on their way to the Danube to raid Bulgaria. Five years later (920) they reappeared, and this time Ihor was forced to fight them (Figure 2). 7 There now follows a hiatus of 21 years in the record during which nothing is known of events in Rus'. When the narrative picks up again in 941 to record the events of the last years of Ihor's reign (he died around 945), the account is much richer in detail, in sharp contrast to the reporting of his early years. This striking difference in the timeline has caused more than a few historians to question the reliability of all texts pertaining not only to Ihor's early career, but to many of the events prior to 940. 8 There is also the fact that the PVL states (deja vu-like) that at his death Ihor left behind a young son, Sviatoslav, who was but a child. 9 By this time, however, we know the records are accurate for the birth, since Sviatoslav is attested to in other writings from that time. 10 If the PVL is to be believed, a son born to Ihor in 942 or 943 would make the father at least 64 at the time of his birth (the chronicles state Ihor was born about 878) and his mother around 60. This chronology is highly suspect and not only for the late birth. The average medieval life span was only about 35 and probably about a decade or two longer for nobility. 11 A somewhat revised, but far more possible, chronology has Ihor (a Varangian leader) being born around 910 and not necessarily related to Rurik or Oleh in any way, conquering Kyiv about the year 935, 12 and marrying Olha about 940. His subsequent exploits as recounted in the PVL and in other sources would then follow very nicely and make more sense. What about the gap in the timeline? The chronicler obviously had no information for the years 920 to 941, and probably as far back as 911. He more than likely made up the story of young Ihor being the scion of the famous, and by then legendary, Riurik in order to embellish the line of descent and to help bridge the gap in the years from 912 (Oleh's death) to ca. 940. The few campaigns recorded for Ihor in 913-915 and 920 echo similar events recorded earlier (expeditions against the Derevlianians are first mentioned in 883) 13 and for 945 and later, 14 and were clearly made up by the chronicler to fill in embarrassing lacunae. There is no compelling evidence to support the claim that Ihor, or the entire dynasty to follow him, was in any way related to Riurik/Rorik. The so-called Riurikide Dynasty that ruled in Kyiv until 1240, and in Galicia-Volyn untill 1340, should more properly be termed the Ihoride Dynasty. Some discussion is in order regarding Ihor's installation in Kyiv. The PVL mentions that it was Oleh, in the name of the infant Ihor, who usurped the leadership of Kyiv in 882 by killing the city's leaders, Askold and Dyr. An earlier version of the PVL, a compilation known as the Novgorod Chronicle (NPL), has a very similar story but it is a grown Ihor, with his general by the name of Oleh, a man valiant and wise, who undertakes a campaign southward (no year is given) to secure the Dnipro River and arrive at the Kyivan hills. Inquiring as to who rules in Kyiv, they are told: Two brothers, Askold and Dyr. Ihor and Oleh pretended to be just passing by, and having hidden themselves in the boats, they came out to the bank with a small retinue; and representing themselves as ... merchants, they called Askold and Dyr. As they both came down, Ihor's hidden warriors jumped out of the boats, to the bank. And Ihor said to Askold: `Both of you are not kings, nor even of royal stock, but I am a king, and I am fit to reign.' They killed Askold and Dyr ... And Ihor set himself up as king in Kyiv. 15 Another historical source also mentions the capture of Kyiv. Jan Dlugosz's Historia Polonica, a work most likely based on the chronicle Peremyshlian Codex, which has not survived, does not mention Oleh at all; Ihor is the lone actor. The brief statement reads: Ihor ... having attained adulthood, treacherously killed the Kyivan princes, Oszkald [Askold] and Dyr, who suspected no hostility on his part, and then occupied their principality and lands. 16 It would seem, then, that the compiler of the PVL reassigned Oleh, a contemporary of Ihor, to the previous generation in order to help fill out the chronicle of events during the latter decades of the ninth century and early part of the 10th. As we shall see below, however, there are other references that would seem to indicate these two personalities lived at the same time and Oleh could well have served as Ihor's commander-in-chief (voyevoda). The ancient chronicles relate that Kyiv was taken from two Varangian boyars (nobles) Askold and Dyr (Figure 3); they themselves had wrested the city from the large eastern European empire of the Khazars 17 in about 860. 18 How true some of these statements are is difficult to know. Askold and Dyr may in fact have been Khazar vassals since evidence seems to indicate that the Khazars may still have ruled in Kyiv into the 930s. 19 Ihor took Kyiv from the Khazars (whose liegemen may or may not have been Askold and Dir) in about 935 and set about consolidating his rule. The capture and control of Kyiv was a strategic coup. Beginning about the year 900, much of the focus of trade in Eastern Europe had shifted from the Volga River water route to that of the comparatively empty Dnipro. Although there was an obstacle of nine rapids to be overcome (over an almost 70-kilometer stretch) in the lower reaches of the Dnipro River - as well as Pecheneg raiders to guard against during the arduous portage - the dangers were worth it to the Varangians and Rus' traders since this route was so much closer to their ultimate destination of Constantinople. Additionally, the tithes and tolls on Volga River traffic, imposed by the Bulgars and Khazars who controlled that river's passage, could be avoided by the new route. 20 Up to this point the history of Ihor's rule is mostly informed speculation based on sparce and sometimes vague information; it stands in marked contrast to the many detailed reports about Ihor and his Rus' followers that are available for the years 941-945. Some of these sources list Inger (i.e., Ihor) as being the leader of the Rus' at this time, while others mention Helgu (Oleh). Since Oleh, as Ihor's general, conducted some of the Rus' campaigns, such citations are not necessarily contradictory. We will examine these references in more detail in part II of this article.

During the seventh century they conquered some of the neighboring peoples and established the Khazar Kaganate, the first state in eastem Europe. The Kaganate reached its greatest extent in the late eighth century when it grew to encompass northern Caucasia, the Azov steppe, and most of Eastern Europe up to the Dnipro River. Although the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths co-existed peacefully on Khazar territory, it was Judaism that was established as the state religion in the early ninth century. 18 PVL, pp. 59-60. 19 Golb and Pritsak, Khazarian Hebrew Documents, p. 71. 20 The shift in Rus' trade orientation is well described by Franklin, S. and Shepard, J. in Chapter 2 of The Emergence of Rus' 750-1200 (London, Longman Group Ltd., 1996), pp. 71-111.

"During this past Labor Day weekend, the leaders of the AYF (Armenian Youth Federation) decided to begin raising funds to build a youth center in the region of Javakhk in the Republic of Georgia. Javakhk is, of course, a heavily Armenian-populated region that solely belongs to the Georgians, thanks to the legacy of arbitrarily drawn Soviet borders. Sound familiar? Yes, Javakhk is the Armenian version of Karabagh in Georgia. There is, of course, one importance difference; the Armenians in Javakhk are not seeking independence. Enter the Tashnagtsagans. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) is the major fanatically patriotic Armenian political party. For a hundred years they've seen themselves as defenders of the fatherland. When troubles first began in Karabagh, it was Tashnag members of the Diaspora who rushed to aid them (about a dozen or so). Tashnags visualize our homeland as though Dikran the Great was still king, ruling a vast empire from the Mediterranean to the Caspian Sea. They take it as a given that Karabagh is a part of the Greater Armenia, as Nakhichevan and Javakhk should also be. At the moment, Karabagh is solely in the hands of the Armenians. Nakhichevan is a distant dream since there are no longer Armenians living there, thanks to Azerbaijani ethnic cleansing. Javakhk, on the other hand, presents a tangible and doable goal. The problem is the general apathy of the population of Javakhk. Those living there simply do not see being a part of Greater Armenia as that important; it's just not worth the trouble. Such a stance, of course, is UNACCEPTABLE to the ARF. Which brings us back to the AYF Olympics and the curious decision to open a youth center in such a distant land. The plan is obvious. Establish a relationship with the youth in Javakhk. Teach them the proper way for a true Armenian to think. Make them believe that Javakhk is part of Armenia and NOT Georgia. Inspire them; incite them. Cause them to take up arms and throw off the oppressive Georgian yoke...and so it goes, until Javakhk becomes another Karabagh. It is clear that the leaders of the Tashnagtsutiun ordered the AYF to start such an endeavor. It's a tactic often employed by the ARF. When Armenia first became independent in 1991, the ARF immediately targeted the Education Ministry because they knew that the best way to come to power was to control the leaders of tomorrow. This supposed youth center is merely the first step. Slowly the ARF will make its presence known in the community of Javakhk. Unsuspecting parents will send their children to this center, thinking it is a pleasant Western-style place to spend their days. They will realize too late that their children are being brainwashed. Before they know it, war will begin, a war the citizens of Javakhk neither need nor want. It is actually a very good plan from the ARF's point of view. Now is the time of action. Georgia has already lost two Muslim provinces in the same way Azerbaijan lost Karabagh. Russia would probably be glad to see an uprising in Javakhk, as it would only improve their position in the region. It wouldn't surprise me if the Russians gave the ARF the idea, to begin with. The more instability in the region, the more the Caucasian nations will rely on Mother Russia. If Javakhk was to attempt to gain de facto independence, it is clear that the rest of the world would not interfere. The powers of the world did not intervene the previous three times. War is never a good thing. You can be sure that if the citizens of Javakhk start agitating, war will come. The battle will be fought in Javakhk, and the region will be devastated. Armenia, already weakened by the Karabagh Cold War with Azerbaijan, would be wise not to help, for then Karabagh would be in danger as well. The ARF needs to realize that there is little to gain in their blind fanaticism by trying to liberate Javakhk. The Christian Georgians have left the Armenians of Javakhk alone and, more than likely, they'll continue to leave them alone. For centuries, we have wailed about our lost lands. Let us cease to waste our time trying to gain a few worthless inches of terrain. Let us instead focus on the homeland itself, by building industry, utilizing modern technology, implementing the Internet and exercising our gifted manpower. It is time to put King Dikran to rest, and to dream of a new modern Armenia.","Garo, Andre",Armenian Reporter International,2002-10-05,1
"I am writing this letter in response to a delirious and somewhat slanderous letter to the editor titled Another Case of Hatemongering written by a Mr. Marc Mamigonian regarding the content of my previous article published in the August 10, 2002 issue of The Armenian Reporter Int'l, titled Odars in Our Midst. In typical fashion that would have made Abraham Foxman of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League squirm with joy, Mr. Mamigonian resorted to slanderous attacks in a vicious manner, albeit without factual basis or a logically derived perspective. How do I begin to answer ludicrous accusations and skewed historical perceptions without giving the ludicrous and the skewed validity? To begin with, I would suggest that Mr. Mamigonian wipe the foam off his mouth, take a shot of Prozac and read my article yet again. Hopefully, he might see the intended message a second time around. SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT In Mr. Mamigonian's obscure mind, the Inquisition is alive and well, the whole world is out to get the pesky little Jews...and there is a Neo-Nazi lurking in every dark corner, eh, Mr. Mamigonian? However, all of Mr. Mamigonian's slanderous accusations about Nazis and anti-Semitism are a bit passé, very redundant and, not to mention, translucent. Regrettably though, such deplorable rhetoric I did not expect from a fellow Armenian - regardless of how self-hating he may be. Although, I must admit, it does manage to reveal Mr. Mamigonian's true personal character, Armenians like him throughout our sad history have made great lap dogs for the Sultans. Perhaps Mr. Mamigonian would be interested to know that my initial exposure and, thus, knowledge of Judaism came about many years ago through a colleague of mine, who happened to be a secular Jew who had contempt for classical Judaism, and not through some anti-Semitic Website he so foolishly insinuates. Moreover, I need to add that I have great admiration and profound respect for the silent majority of Jews worldwide who are all too aware of the appalling policies of the State of Israel and the sinister agendas of worldwide Zionist establishments. These righteous Jews, who historically were often victimized and led off to the slaughter by their Zionist compatriots, I consider to be the true children of Abraham. But sadly, their presence within the Jewish community has always been marginalized and their voices silenced. For the mentally impaired: My critical observations regarding Jews, hereafter, should be understood to refer only to those Jews to whom the criticism applies, namely anti-Armenian, anti-Christian, anti-Goyim Zionists and the few in our midst who use our community structures as political platforms to convey ambiguous and self-serving agendas. While I do not wish to entertain Mr. Mamigonian's absurd rhetoric at any extent, I shall make several points to clarify some aspects of his comments by allowing a couple of righteous Jews to do the talking. Though it was not my intent at all to get into a discussion about sacred literature, nevertheless, it was very peculiar to me that Mr. Mamigonian, who I am assuming to be a Christian, seemed to specifically take offense at my description of Judaism's most revered Talmud within my previous article as racist, sexist, genocidal and blaspheming (incidentally, comments similar to mine and worse were made throughout history regarding the Talmud by countless men and women of prominence, outraged Catholic Pontiffs, Protestant Reformers such as Martin Luther, many of America's founding fathers and even righteous Jews - who, upon realizing the detestable nature of certain elements within the Talmud and classical Judaism, wanted to disassociate themselves from it). THE TALMUD EXPOSED The chauvinistic and racist nature of the Talmud, which supercedes the Torah (Old Testament) within Classical Judaism, is one of the primary reasons why many decent Jews today, especially within America, are choosing to join Reformed congregations that diminish the traditional supremacy of Talmudic Judaism. Mr. Mamigonian's apparent contempt for and ignorance of Christianity is disgraceful, for he claims that Christ was simply a Jew executed by Roman justice!!! Executed by Roman justice? Apparently, the biblical texts regarding the Roman governor Pontius Pilot's washing of his hands from the guilt of being forced to crucify Christ by the Sanhedrin (rabbinical court) and an angry Jewish mob in the governor's court yard is news to Mr. Mamigonian (incidentally, in boastful Talmudic accounts of the execution of Christ, Romans are not even mentioned). Moreover, Mr. Mamigonian reveals selective memory when he makes excuses as to why Jews have great contempt for the Christian Church, specifically Catholicism, and Christ's Crucifix without first mentioning that, for the early centuries after the Crucifixion of Christ, it was the adherents of Classical Judaism who were oppressing and persecuting the fledgling Christian community. Furthermore, Mr. Mamigonian cynically states that the New Testament - renowned universally for its egalitarianism, tolerance and humility - can be taken out of context and misquoted to validate genocide, racism or hate, as is commonly and justifiably done with the Talmud and to a certain degree with the Torah and the Islamic Koran. I do not know how to respond to such blatant anti-Christian hostility coming from within our community. When rhetoric degenerates to such pathetic and sad levels, I am at a loss for words. Since quoting from the Talmud by myself is going to be considered taken out of context by Talmudic scholars such as Mr. Mamigonian, and since quoting non-Jews regarding the Talmud would be considered anti-Semitic by the likes of him, I shall quote an excerpt from a book written by Dr. Israel Shahak, a highly respected Jewish political activist and scholar (Well, then again, even quoting Jews is fruitless to hysteria-stricken individuals. When they don't like the message by the Jew in question, the messenger is rather conveniently labeled as an anti-Semite, most often getting shunned by fellow Jews and quite often getting threatened with violence). Dr. Shahak, in his very well-written and revealing book titled Jewish history - Jewish religion (I highly recommend all Armenians, especially community activists and clergy, to read it) has this to say to his fellow Jews about the Talmud in his chapter titled Prejudice and Prevarication: The Christian campaign against the Talmud was apparently brought on by the conversion to Christianity of Jews who were well versed in the Talmud and who were in many cases attracted by the development of Christian philosophy, with its strong Aristotelian (and thus universal) character. It must be admitted at the outset that the Talmud and the Talmudic literature - quite apart from the general anti-Gentile streak that runs through them, which will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter 5 - contain very offensive statements and precepts directed specifically against Christianity. For example, in addition to a series of scurrilous allegations against Jesus, the Talmud states that his punishment in hell is to be immersed in boiling excrement - a statement not exactly calculated to endear the Talmud to devout Christians. Or one can quote the precept according to which Jews are instructed (within the Talmud) to burn, publicly if possible, any copy of the New Testament that comes into their hands. This is not only still in force but actually practiced today; thus on 23 March 1980 hundreds of copies of the New Testament were publicly and ceremonially burnt in Jerusalem under the auspices of Yad Le'akhim, a Jewish religious organization subsidized by the Israeli Ministry of Religions. Regarding racist views of certain segments of Judaism, Dr. Shahak further writes in the same chapter: What, then, are the views of this movement (Hassidism) concerning non-Jews? As an example, let us take the famous Hatanya, fundamental book of the Habbad movement, one of the most important branches of Hassidism. According to this book, all non-Jews are totally satanic creatures 'in whom there is absolutely nothing good'. Even a non-Jewish embryo is qualitatively different from a Jewish one. The very existence of a non-Jew is 'inessential', whereas all of creation was created solely for the sake of the Jews...According to the testimony of Shulamit Aloni, member of the Knesset, this Habbad propaganda was particularly stepped up before Israel's invasion of Lebanon in March 1978, in order to induce military doctors and nurses to withhold medical help from 'Gentile wounded'. This Nazi-like advice did not refer specifically to Arabs or Palestinians, but simply to 'Gentiles', goyim... Hmmm...Does this classical Judaism and its various branches practiced today by large segments of worldwide Jewry sound a bit like institutionalized hate mongering, and, as Dr. Shahak states, strangely enough like...Nazi Ideology? Could that possibly be, Mr. Mamigonian? Mr. Mamigonian should ask himself a question: Where in the Christian or Muslim cultures, or for that matter, any culture on God's earth (including Turkic) can you find such adhered-to twisted theology and sacred literature as you would within certain segments of mainstream Judaism? Moreover, it's very revealing that the propagation of such racist theology is fully subsidized and encouraged by the authorities in Israel. God forbid we Armenians held such outrageous supremacist beliefs within our assembly halls and churches. Ramgavars who may be reading this article might just want to go over to the nearest Dashnak and hug him, for even the ultra-nationalist fanatical Dashnaks, as they are known within some circles, pale in comparison to the Hassidic movement. Even an Armenian Nazi like myself, as Mr. Mamigonian insinuates, would at least help a Turk in dire straits...and yes, even a Jew. And, I generally consider embryos of Odars more or less the same as ours (although ours must be a bit more hairy) EXPOSING TRUE ZIONISM The other thing that truly disturbed me were Mr. Mamigonian's hateful remarks regarding the Arab world in general and the Palestinians in particular. It is utterly disgusting that Mr. Mamigonian, parroting Mr. Russell, shamelessly equates the Armenian Genocide at the hands of the Turks with Arab opposition to Zionism. Insinuating that the same kind of Islamic militancy that is killing Jews today is similar to Islamic Turks exterminating its Armenian population. No, Mr. Mamigonian, try your disgusting historical distortions elsewhere...it was Pan-Turkism that sought to exterminate Armenians - not Islam. I will not allow pathetic little individuals to defame the honorable memory of 1.5 million of my compatriots who perished during the First World War. Mr. Mamigonian is a shameless example of historical revisionism at its worst. Of all people, we Armenians should think twice before betraying those who gave us shelter during the Armenian Genocide. I need to reiterate once again for the mentally challenged that Christian Armenians have lived unmolested lives in virtually all Islamic nations of the Middle East. It shouldn't require a very high intelligence or insight from a person to realize that the Armenians who have been leaving the Middle East are doing so primarily due to economic reasons and the ubiquitous regional turmoil. I ask: Where on earth, besides Turkey and Azerbaijan, have Armenian lands been confiscated, Armenian churches spat upon, Armenian clergy physically attacked, Armenians treated as second class, the recognition of the Armenian Genocide actively undermined and Armenia's enemies armed? The answer is - The Zionist State of Israel. It's very peculiar to me that adherents of classical Judaism have been despised, at one time or another, by virtually every nation they have dwelled in throughout history - with the exception of Turkic nations. And, the Armenians have been a well-respected and often protected group of people in virtually every country they have dwelled - with the exception of Turkic nations (Hmmm...If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would be seeing a peculiarly ominous formula developing). It seems to me that Mr. Mamigonian is the true anti-Semite; after all, Arabs are a Semitic people, and incidentally, much more so than most blond-haired blue-eyed Jews of Ashkenazi decent. Obviously, Mr. Mamigonian has not been able to see, or his incomprehensible devotion to Israel compels him not to see, the true intentions and designs of practical Zionism in Palestine - namely, the eradication of its native population by any means necessary. Zionism is God-sanctioned genocide and cannot be sensibly explained otherwise. Yet, Mr. Mamigonian has only managed to see and believe the political shenanigans played by Israeli officials and their Bible-Belt puppets in Washington, DC (such as the famous land offer proposed by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to the Palestinians which was in essence just a cleverly packaged Native American land reservation). Again, Mr. Mamigonian's ignorance of history and politics is breathtaking. However, I am confident that, regarding the Palestinian issue, most Armenians would be able to see through the twisted and callous opinions of Mr. Mamigonian and call it as it is. Nevertheless, I do want a Jew to expose Mr. Mamigonian to what has been really going on in Palestine for the past fifty-five years. So, allow me to refer to another righteous Jew named Ralph Schoenman. Mr. Schoenman is a lifelong Jewish peace activist who claims to have lost over seventy members of his extended family in the Holocaust during the Second World War. He has extensively documented the criminal pursuits of Zionists, Zionist collusion with Nazis Germany, and Zionism's genocidal designs in Palestine. Needless to say, Mr. Schoenman is considered, ironically, to be an anti-Semite - apparently for having the chutzpah to reveal the truth. In chapter two of his book titled The Hidden History of Zionism, which, incidentally, is another book highly recommended for Armenians, Mr. Schoenman writes: What distinguishes Zipnism from other colonial movements is the relationship between the settlers and the people to be conquered. The avowed purpose of the Zionist movement was not merely to exploit the Palestinian people but to disperse and dispossess them. The intent was to replace the indigenous population with a new settler community, to eradicate the farmers, artisans and town-dwellers of Palestine and substitute an entirely new workforce composed of the settler population. In denying the existence of the Palestinian people, Zionism sought to create the political climate for their removal, not only from their land but from history. When acknowledged at all, the Palestinians were re-invented as a semi-savage, nomadic remnant. Historical records were falsified - a procedure begun during the last quarter of the 19th century but continuing to this day in such pseudo-historical writings as Joan Peters' From Time Immemorial. The Zionist movement would seek alternative imperial sponsors for this bloody enterprise; among them the Ottoman Empire, Imperial Germany, the British Raj, French colonialism and Czarist Russia. Zionist plans for the Palestinian people anticipated the Ottoman solution for the Armenians, who would be slaughtered in the first sustained genocide of the 20th century...From its inception, the Zionist movement sought the Armenianization of the Palestinian people. Like the Native Americans, the Palestinians were a people too many. The logic was elimination; the record was to be one of genocide...When the Armenians escaping the Turkish genocide settled in Palestine they were welcomed (by Arabs). The genocide was ominously defended by Vladimir Jabotinsky and other Zionists in their attempts to obtain Turkish support. ARMENIANS BEWARE Though I did not want to entertain ignorance, nevertheless, I wanted the unsuspecting and somewhat naive Armenian community at large to be exposed to such issues and topics and, hopefully, start discussing it amongst themselves. I believe that such exposure and debate are crucial to public awareness. To that effect, I would like to thank Mr. Mamigonian for giving me this opportunity, and thus, the forum to do as such. Armenians Beware: A natural enemy that is perceived as a friend can do a great deal more harm to us than the enemy that is readily recognized, especially when the perceived friend and the recognized enemy are genuine friends themselves. Because we Armenians generally have a bad habit of desperately seeking approval from Odars, especially Jews, the primary intention of my previous article was to show that the Republic of Armenia and, thus, the Armenian nation at large, does not and will not in the foreseeable future fit the grandiose geo-strategic formulations of Tel Aviv and Ankara. Therefore, our futile attempts to forge alliances of any form with Zionist entities or personalities are counter productive to our national agendas and, thus, a waste of our limited resources. The overtly hostile policies of the State of Israel towards the Republic of Armenia are facts that are well documented and cannot be refuted. Armenia and Armenians are just obstructive nuisances to official Judeo-Turkic aspirations. Whether it's author Yossi Klein, with his subtle attacks on our nation and church; James Russell, who uses his influential position as chairman of Armenian studies at Harvard to distort the realities of the Armenian Genocide, demean the aboriginal origins of the Armenian nation in greater Armenia, or viciously attack our great national heroes like Drastamat Kanayan and Garegin Njdeh; documentary film producer Andrew Goldberg (producer of Armenian Americans) using the television media to likewise belittle the aboriginal roots of Armenians in greater Armenia and to skew the viability of the just struggle for the Republic of Nagorno Karabagh - Zionists in our midst should never again be given the platform of opportunity to misrepresent and distort the geo-political agendas of the Republic of Armenia/Artsakh, the indigenous history of Armenians in greater Armenia and the solemn realities of the Armenian Genocide. Jewish establishments worldwide have continually and consistently conspired against and misrepresented Armenia and Armenians throughout the past century (for the mentally deficient in our midst, I need to reiterate yet again: I am not suggesting any level of culpability as regards many honorable Jews who, in their individual capacity, share our values and our pains). Unfortunately, much of the misrepresentation and manipulation of Armenians here in America has come about on platforms provided by us unsuspecting and somewhat subservient Armenians, and Mr. Mamigonian is a flaming example. Enough is enough. As I stated in my previous article - we need to choose our friends and partners wisely. SETTING OUR PRIORITIES Since Mr. Mamigonian claims to be a close friend and admirer of Mr. Russell, I would like to remind Mr. Mamigonian once again that Mr. Russell, regardless of his professional qualifications, should not forget his conditional position within the Armenian community. Mr. Russell's professional services regarding Armenian studies do not in any way give him the liberty to attack any Armenian organization or individual. On the contrary, Mr. Russell's position as an Armenian studies chairman requires his conformity with and subservience to the greater Armenian community, regardless of its political affiliations. The lip service provided by Mr. Russell regarding Armenian issues is easily replaceable by better qualified Armenians (incidentally, I would like to know of a Jewish chair that is headed by a Gentile, let alone an Armenian). Therefore, Armenians, regardless of their political associations, should not tolerate such historical revisionism, slander and anti-Armenian hostility right under our noses, especially from foreign sources. Those of us who vehemently preach national unity must realize that such a unity starts from within our national consciousness and ethnic solidarity - and not within our churches. Let's get our priorities straight and our perspectives properly adjusted. In closing, I would like to advise Mr. Mamigonian and Mr. Russell to reserve their hostile egos and Nazi rhetoric for the genocidal fascists in Tel Aviv and the Zionist founding fathers of Israel who, as they should well know, directly collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War. Moreover, they should devote their feisty energies to battling revisionists such as Jewish and Turkish institutions and scholars who are actively and concurrently engaged in discrediting the historical realities of the Armenian nation and the Armenian Genocide. Finally, I have a bit of advice for Mr. Mamigonian: Do yourself and the entire Armenian nation a favor - please, please stay in the little corner of the Armenian community you mentioned that you work in, you're not ready to come out yet.","Aghjayan, Haroutioun",Armenian Reporter International,2002-10-05,1
"When Polish Army engineers came to Afghanistan as part of the U.S.-led coalition, one of their main tasks was clear some of the thousands of mines left behind during more than two decades of bloody warfare. Coming from a country that too often known the destruction of war, the Poles were also deeply moved by the plight of the Afghan people, especially the children. In this almost entirely Muslim country, these Catholic soldiers longed for a place to pray and worship. Directed by their chaplain, the Poles turned a bombed-out building at the air base in Bagram, Afghanistan, into a small chapel. Only one thing was missing: a statue of Our Lady. Fr. Robert McMeekin of the Holy Cross Orthodox Mission of the Twin Cities, serving as a U.S. Army chaplain, heard about this and through one of his parishioners contacted the Polish American Cultural Institute of Minnesota (PACIM). PACIM quickly found a statue of Our Lady, donated by one of its members, and shipped it to Afghanistan. The arrival of the statue was a great boost for the Polish engineers and it was placed in the chapel and blessed in a special ceremony by Polish and American field chaplains. The daily struggle to rebuild Afghanistan goes on as American and Polish soldiers once again serve side by side. Now, however, then do so knowing greater help and comfort. In appreciation for this gift, the Poles sent back the following prayer: Prayer to Our Lady of Afghanistan O our Most-holy Lady and ever-Virgin Mother of God: receive the children of Afghanistan into the safety of your loving arms. Intercede before your Son and Our God to heal this broken land, unite this divided people, and keep them forever under your care. For you are the Haven of the helpless, the Hope of the hopeless and our Protection through all adversity. Amen.

"THE Magdalene Sisters has won another major film award - and been slammed by yet another group of outraged Catholics. Sisters won the critics' prize at the Toronto International Film Festival this week, just a week after the film took home the Gold Lion for Best Film at the Venice Film Festival earlier this month. But not everyone loves Scottish director Peter Mullan's movie. Sisters, about brutality in Irish convents, was compared to Nazi-era propaganda by the high-powered Catholic League for Civil Rights this week. The Vatican's L'Osservatore Romano newspaper has already protested the film, calling Sisters an angry and rancorous provocation. Set in 1960s Ireland, the movie follows the lives of four young women placed in convents where fallen women were forced to do menial tasks and often physically abused. Now that the film - to be shown at next month's New York Film Festival - has been picked up for U.S. distribution by indy powerhouse Miramax, The Catholic League has come out swinging. The group has appealed to the Disney corporation to drop the film's distributors, Miramax, and compared Magdalene Sisters' director Peter Mullan to Leni Riefenstahl, the Nazi-era director who made Hitler's best propaganda films. The Catholic League has a long history of high-profile boycotts of film distributors, particularly Miramax. In 1995 it persuaded an Irish Catholic group to drop $3 million worth of Disney stock because of a film about a gay priest. League President William Donohue said that Peter Mullan has compared the Catholic Church to the Taliban and said that the Catholic League would launch a relentless protest against the film. Donahue also cited a number of past Miramax releases which he deemed anti-Catholic. Harvey Weinstein of Miramax is known for such anti-Catholic movies as Priest, Butcher Boy, Dogma, and 40 Days and 40 Nights, Donahue said. The Magdalene Sisters is based on the allegedly cruel behavior of Irish nuns who maintained homes for wayward young girls and their babies in the 19th and 20th centuries. To be sure, conditions were harsh by today's standards but they were not uncommon in their day: historians have recounted how Protestant-run institutions were similar. Donohue said that the girls would have had to fend for themselves if the Church had not intervened. He also hit out at Samuel Goldwyn Films for buying The Crime of Father Amaro, about a 16-year-old who becomes pregnant by a priest, and said filmmakers would not treat the Muslim religion with such disrespect. A Miramax spokesperson said that The Magdalene Sisters was a serious attempt to address a very serious subject and had been acclaimed on both sides of the Atlantic. This film was voted the best at one of the world's most prestigious film festivals. We think that speaks for itself, he said.","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2002-09-24,1
"THIS time last year, Irish political and religious leaders gathered in the Pro-Cathedral as part of our national day of mourning following the September 11 attacks. President Mary McAleese, Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern and his partner Celia Larkin were there. So too were the army's top brass, members of the Cabinet, the diplomatic corps, and all the representatives of the main Christian churches. But there were no Muslim representatives. The leaders of Ireland's growing Islamic community simply weren't invited. It was a snub that caused particular hurt to an already vulnerable community. In the days following the attacks, there were fears of a backlash against the 20,000 strong Muslim community in Ireland. Journalists who made their way to the mosque in Milltown to ask the Imam, Dr. Ali Abdullah for his views, seemed to tar all Muslims with the same brush. Abdullah didn't mince his words. We hate bin Laden. Wipe him from the map; wipe out the Taliban with him. That is the best thing you could do for Muslims. Bin Laden is a criminal. The people who attacked New York and Washington were killers. They weren't Muslims. What they did was a crime against Islam, he told this reporter during an interview not long after the attacks. When you talk about Omagh, do you say that Christians killed those people? Do you ask Christians were they happy about what happened as we have been asked so many times in the last few days -- as if there was a possibility that we might justify it? If you can justify what happened in America you can justify what the devil does. A year on, the Imam says the tragic events of September 11 have led to a greater understanding and respect for his community in Ireland. This week his community will hold a condolence meeting for the victims of the terrorist attacks. A conference on human rights is also being held to mark the first anniversary. What happened on September 11 was tragic and criminal. But the tragedy exposed the ignorance that there was towards our community, he says. Since then things have changed. The community is more aware of minorities here. Another Muslim school is opening in Dublin. The Department of Education is putting courses about religion on the curriculum, we have even been invited to prayers for peace by the Cardinal. Not all within the Ireland's 20,000 Muslim community share his views, however. For 10 months, members of the Special Detective Unit, formerly known as the Special Branch, watched the mosque on South Circular Road where they believed that sympathizers of bin Laden were attending prayers. The imam at South Circular Road mosque, Yahya M. Al-Hussein, was disturbed by their presence. Every Friday they parked their car across the road, sometimes they would be there at weekends as well. It was very intimidating, and totally unnecessary, he says. We always had good relations with the aliens office, if they wanted to know who someone was, and we knew, we would tell them. But to stand there, watching us like that, was very irritating. This is a religious place. They wouldn't do this in front of a church if they were looking for an IRA man. If they wanted to watch someone, they could have stood outside his home, instead of incriminating everyone who came to the mosque and the mosque itself. There was an element of discrimination here. Surveillance at the mosque was called off two months ago after complaints from the community, but a small corps of Gardai (police) known as the Red Squad, and a unit of army intelligence known as G2, still monitor the activities of some of those who attend. In the weeks following the attacks, four men were arrested in Ireland and held for three days. The three Libyans and an Algerian were released without charge, but their photographs appeared in one national paper under a headline We Find bin Laden Army Hiding in Ireland. The Gardai could find no evidence linking them to al-Qaeda, but speculation about a terrorist cell, operating in the leafy suburbs of Dublin, continues. The outing of the men brought considerable hardship for their families, according to one of those arrested. He has been living in Ireland for the last 20 years. His neighbors no longer trust the family, he says. His wife complains of stones being thrown at their windows. Even when I go to the mosque people are afraid to be seen associating with me. A man, whom I asked to teach Arabic to my children, had his house raided at six in the morning. I have had to change my phone number three times because of abusive calls. Ireland, he says, is suffering from Islamaphobia. In recent weeks there have been claims that some of those being monitored by police and army intelligence were part of an unsuccessful Talibaninspired plot to take over the mosque on the South Circular Road in the late 1990s. Utter nonsense, is how al-Hussein describes the reports. The Taliban can't even manage their own country. I doubt if they ever even heard of Ireland. As a registered society, we have elections every year for the council which runs the Islamic Foundation of Ireland. But there was nothing unusual in the late 1990s. The mosque was attacked in July 1997, but he believes it was the work of locals rather than Muslims. One of the figures supposed to have been behind the so-called Taliban plot was Hamid Aich, who left Ireland two months before September 11. He has been linked to the al-Qaeda millennium plot in Los Angeles. Hamid Aich, says the Imam, shared an apartment in Canada with a man accused of bringing arms across the border to the U.S. He was an asylum seeker here and was married to a Japanese lady. His brother was one of those who was arrested last year. He's not even a practicing Muslim. There may well be people who sympathize with bin Laden but are they a cell or in any way active? I doubt it, he says. The North African asylum seeker, who cannot be named for legal reasons, says he met Hamid Aich at Friday prayers on a number of occasions, prior to his disappearance. Some say he is now in Afghanistan, some say he is in Cork. Who knows? he smiles. I don't believe there is any Al-Qaeda cell here. The people in this community are here to make a living and enjoy life. My base, my Qaeda, is my wife and four children, he adds. Since the attacks on the Twin Towers, financial institutions in Ireland have frozen accounts belonging to six individuals. The total value of the accounts comes to almost $130,000. The Criminal Assets Bureau has been looking into suspicious bank accounts and the Fraud Squad has been investigating money laundering and credit card fraud which may be linked to al-Qaeda. A senior source in the Criminal Assets Bureau says that the bureau has only operated on the margins of Ireland's war on terror. It wasn't earth shattering stuff, he says. Very little money was identified, but the terrorists involved didn't need huge amounts of money. No one is saying that there are very active terrorists operating here, says an army source. But it's an ideal place for support groups, people who can organize visa cards, or stolen passports, people who can harbor money. Ireland has had a relatively benign security environment. Until recent years it was relatively easy to get it and out, both legally and illegally. But to date they have found little to stand up the theory that one of bin Laden's cells was operating out of Ireland. The North African, who was among those arrested, is regularly stopped by the Special Detective Unit but says he has no involvement in any terror group.

"The victims of the September 11th tragedy and terror are being remembered with special civic and religious ceremonies throughout the world. Following this carnage, many nations joined forces to fight against the invisible common enemy, international terrorism, which was openly challenging all of civilization. The leaders of U.S. and Russia, realizing that the national security of their respective countries was endangered, vowed to cooperate. An act that changed the entire international political landscape permanently. Forty-seven years ago, on September 6-7, 1955, there was another tragedy that changed the lives of an entire generation, including myself. Turkish mobs, armed and instigated by Turkish government agents, began a savage attack against minorities at 5:50 p.m. on September 6. During those two days, 59 Greek and 14 Armenian churches suffered serious damage, icons and ancient paintings were looted, and tombs of the patriarchs were destroyed. 3000 Greek and 1000 Armenian homes were attacked, burned and looted. 4348 Greek and 1050 Armenian stores were demolished. 100 hotels, 27 pharmacies, 20 factories - all minority owned, as well as 52 Greek and 8 Armenian schools were wrecked. 200 Greek and a similar number of Armenian teenage girls were raped in front of their parents. The number of deaths, even today, remains a state secret. These pogroms was premeditated, organized and instigated by Turkish government agents under direct order from the Interior Ministry and were intended to force Greeks and Armenians to abandon their wealth and property and migrate. As a result, 250,000 Greeks and 50,000 Armenians left Istanbul for abroad. GOVERNMENT'S ROLE CLEAR Now some Turkish newspapers, like Radical (Radikal) and Milliyet, as well as Turkish human-rights activists are trying to explain why this happened. Those who deny that the 1915 events were not premeditated or organized by the Ottoman government and claim that Armenian casualties were merely the result of war, starvation and illness, should look carefully at all the mechanics of those 1955 events. Then they will realize that, in Turkey, this kind of carnage could happen only with the authorities' permission and approval. According to historical accounts, at the height of the Greek and Turkish dispute over Cyprus, Turkish Interior Minister Namik Gedik, with the approval of Prime Minister Adnan Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin Rustu Zorlu, sent a government secret agent, law student Oktay Engin Faik, to Selanik (Salonica) to plant a bomb in Ataturk's birthplace. Even before the explosion took place, the Turkish Embassy in Athens, under the directive of the Turkish government, sent forged photos to Turkish newspapers, depicting Ataturk's birthplace as totally destroyed, thus intentionally setting off waves of anger among the Turkish populace. Based on the plan of the Turkish secret police and intelligence agency, the Turkish authorities then transported large mobs in military vehicles and buses from Anatolia to Istanbul, armed with axes, shovels, iron bars and butcher knives. On September 6 at 5:50 p.m. mobs started to move in previously marked residential areas and business districts inhabited or owned by Greeks and Armenians, smashing windows, breaking doors, looting houses and stores, beating inhabitants and raping teenage girls, setting churches, seminaries and schools on fire, desecrating cemeteries, demolishing minority-owned factories, shops, hotels, restaurants, pharmacies, factories and even physician's offices. All these savage attacks were done under the supervision of authorities and police, who were calmly assisting and even guiding the mobs to residential areas inhabited by Greeks, Armenians and, to a lesser degree, Jews. The overzealous Turkish mob screamed threatening slogans, like Giaours (infidels), today your property, tomorrow your lives will be destroyed. A NIGHTMARE INDEED The devastation, beating and raping continued until 2:00 a.m. on September 7. The Turkish government, realizing that things had gotten out of the hand, and fearing wholesale massacres of the Christian population and their repercussions in the whole civilized world, finally declared a curfew. The tanks, armored vehicles, cavalry and gandarme divisions entered the devastated city to control uncontrollable Turkish mobs. It was indeed a nightmare. One still can hear the sounds of broken glass, or see the ugly silhouettes of Turkish mobs beating and raping innocent people, or smell the fumes of the burning houses, churches and schools, hear the cries of the victims, and feel the shadow of death. The psychological scars of this devastation, destruction, rape and humiliation are comparable only to the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923. Those of us that grew up while Mustafa Kemal or Ismet Inonu were president, despite a forceful Turkification and Islamization campaign and capital tax ordeal, never expected this kind of hostility, threat and endangerment of our lives. Young generations of Armenians, who are hardly aware of the Armenian Genocide and are often skeptical about their parents' 1915 accounts, suddenly have realized that what their elders were telling them was not farfetched at all, that this kind of horror could be organized and executed by the government. As September 11, 2002 changed the world permanently, so too September 6-7, 1955 changed the life of Greeks and Armenians in Istanbul unremittingly. The exodus of 250,000 Greeks, 50,000 Armenians and 40,000 Jews from Istanbul and the influx of eight million Anatolian Turks into the city changed the demography of this once cosmopolitan town forever. Some enlightened and intellectual Turks are still reminiscing about the good old days of Istanbul when the minorities added a special flavor and color to city life. Yet, for the average anti-Christian Turk, the departure of the minorities is considered to be the best thing that happened; the late President Ismet Inonu's dream came true, as Muslim Turks are the sole owners of the land.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-09-14,1
"WITH this horrible, unwanted anniversary approaching, we ask: What does one do on that day? For those who lost loved ones, there can be no answer, other than, whatever comforts you in some way. For the rest of New York and America, it's a slightly more thorny question. Some thoughts on the matter... First, vote in the September 10 primaries - What could be a more splendid rebuke to the tyrants who practice terrorism than simply parting the voting booth curtains and pulling the lever. Democracy may not always be pretty (remember the chad mess down in Florida?). But this year, it's worth your effort, even if you don't care who the next New York State comptroller is. Give blood - On the afternoon of September 11, I walked over to a hospital around 2 p.m. and was told that more than enough blood had already been donated. And this was before it became clear, later that day, that few people would emerge from the rubble in need of blood. Well, now might be the time for all of us to give the blood we meant to give that day. It's a small thing, sure. But it's no small thing to someone in need, particularly if you are of a rare blood type. (Along these same lines, make a point to regularly donate a small amount of money to the charity of your choice, and don't forget to offer a pat on the back to a firefighter, police officer or ironworker.) The attacks of September 11 forced us to confront the biggest questions of the universe. But they should also make us realize just how important the small things are. Along those lines, come Wednesday, many New Yorkers will be asking themselves... To work or not to work? Chances are, at least this year, many places of business will be closed on September 11. That, to me, is appropriate. Sure, to some degree, we should forge ahead with our lives, and thumb our nose at the terrorists by doing what it is Americans do best: making money. (Some people, of course, will have no choice - including the rescue workers whose bravery we now, finally, respect, even if their paychecks don't quite reflect that.) Still, with only 365 days separating then from now, I say, if you can get the day off from work, spend time with loved ones. Have a barbecue. Call someone you haven't seen in awhile. Count your blessings. And (though it's sometimes easy to forget this) friends and family are indeed blessings. One thing you may want to avoid, though, is... Shopping - Down the road, we would be in very bad shape if September 11 turns into 9/11 Sales Days! at clothing stores or electronics gizmo chains. Not many people have said this because it may sound crass, but the days right after September 11 were not only sad, touching and painful. They were also special because that which is coarse and cheap about contemporary American life briefly vanished. Tacky comedians stopped cracking tasteless, intentionally offensive jokes; TV stations stopped running insanely loud, cheaply ironic commercials. All that background noise quieted - at least for a little while. We had to focus on the basics - life, death, bravery, sacrifice, the fleeting nature of existence. Now, that's a bit heavy every day. On the other hand, I'd prefer to focus on that stuff than tacky TV shows like Fear Factor, Dog Eat Dog, and of course, everyone's current favorite whipping girl, Anna Nicole Smith. But, September 11 each year should not solely be a deep and heavy reflection on loss. It should also celebrate the good which remains in the world. With good not meaning good sales at the malls and good video games. Those things have their place. But September 11 should be about more than that. Open your mind - Please, do not roll your eyes yet. Because to many people, yes, this is just a code phrase for, basically, excusing the cruel acts of murderous terrorists. So, to those who feel George W. Bush is just a warmonger, perhaps September 11 is a day for you to consider that, maybe, just maybe, there's a future tragedy to be averted in confronting Saddam Hussein. Similarly, if you're of a mind that any practicing Muslim in the U.S. should be deported, perhaps you should recall that many in America felt the same about Irish Catholics following the chaos of the Civil War Draft Riots in 1863. Finally, do not remember only those who died. Remember, also, their loved ones, whose lives will never be the same.

"Turkish extremist forces are masters of deception and dirty tricks. In many instances, in order to discredit their opponents, who are considered to be formidable foes, they call in question the ethnicity, religious affiliation, political philosophy and the allegiance of those individuals. One of the most commonly used tactics is to malign the individual in question for hiding his/her Armenian, Greek, Jewish or Kurdish ancestry. Anyone who dares to challenge them is labeled an anti-Turk or enemy of the Turkish state. For some time, they were propagandizing that the rebel Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan has Armenian blood, which turned out to be false. Similarly, they are now claiming that Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's wife Rahsan Ecevit, the former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, and former Economy Minister Kemal Dervis are all secret Sebetaist/Donmeh (Jews converted to Islam and followers of the Sebatai Zevi sect). Turkish right-wing activists Mustafa Saka, Ozcan Soysal, Melih Arsun, Ceyhun Sunsay, Ali Riza Sakli and others are intentionally creating politically explosive conditions and controversy prior to the upcoming Turkish elections in November. In most civilized countries, citizens would be indifferent as to whether the politician involved has Jewish or Armenian background. Yet, in Turkey, such a background is more than enough reason to ruin anyone's political carrier immediately. These anti-Semitic Turkish rightwing activists are now exposing dirty laundry: they are accusing Freemasons and Donmehs of destroying the Ottoman Empire, and annihilating the Ottoman Armenian population; they are blaming them for trying to get Turkey admitted into the European Union, thus accelerating separatism and the eventual destruction of the Turkish Republic. They mention names, sects, individuals, organizations and historical events that took place during the Ottoman period and continued under its successor Turkish Republic, all of which could be very confusing for readers not familiar with Ottoman and Turkish history. Therefore it would be useful to quote these Turkish right-wingers while attempting to explain to the readers what they are talking about. The issues they are raising are complex, are open to discussion in historical terms, and are relevant when it comes to defining the political events of yesteryear and today, which took place under the Ottoman Empire and Turkish Republic. RIGHT-WINGERS TO THE FORE To open the discussion, it would be interesting to quote Rahsan Ecevit (wife of Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit), whose ancestors, according to Turkish right-wingers, are allegedly linked to Sabetaist convert Jews. Rahsen Hanim stated that the Turkish nation is not only composed of those Turks who emigrated from Central Asia and settled in the Anatolian territory, but also, in today's Turkey, citizens are descendants of an amalgam of different ethnic groups and civilizations, who lived in our territory for thousands of years. She is absolutely correct in terms of historical facts and realities. The late Alpaslan Turkesh, the founder of the Grey Wolves/Bozkurts, once stated, Whoever genuinely proclaims and accepts that he is a Turk should be called a Turk. He is also absolutely right in saying that practically anyone who is a citizen of Turkey is called a Turk. Yet the question is: Is everyone living in this country called turkey accepted as a Turk? The answer is no. According to the Turkish right-wingers, distinction has to be made between those who are the real Turks and those who are not. Let's review several terminologies and arguments that Turkish extremists are introducing to their readers to prove their case; namely, that those who are not pure Turks have destroyed the Ottoman Empire and are now busy trying to destroy Turkish Republic. DONMEH AND SEBATAISM Donmeh and Sebataism: According to the Donmeh web site, Donmeh is the Turkish word for apostate and refers to the Jews of the Near East who followed Sebatai Zevi into Islam in 1666, but secretly remained Jews and continued practicing Jewish rituals but worshipped Sebatai Zevi as the Messiah and incarnation of God. According to this web site, there are 15,000 members of Donmeh (according to Turkish Islamists, there are 100,000 members) mostly in the Turkish cities of Edirne (Adrianople), Istanbul, Izmir (Smyrna) and the former Ottoman city of Selanik (Salonika). According to the Donmeh web site, Although outwardly Muslim and, to a lesser extent, Christians, the Donmeh secretly continue to observe Jewish rituals (such as circumcision, but at the age of three rather than eight days), pray in Hebrew as well as Aramaic and Ladino (a Sephardic dialect of Yiddish, Hebrew and Spanish), and have clandestine festivals and fast days that are Jewish cultural survivals. (It is important to note that there are also Armenian converts who have adopted the religion of Islam. They are called Hamshins and dwell mostly in northeastern Turkey. They speak an Armenian dialect and practice the Moslem religion yet they preserve some Armenian rituals. Deputy Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, according to the Turkish right-wingers, has Hamshin ancestors). WHO WAS SEBATAI ZEVI? Sebatai Zevi (1626-1676): The Jewish mystic and Messiah! He was suffering from manic depressive psychosis, and he and his followers believed that he was the Messiah. He was not a follower of the Torah Talmud, but instead he adopted the teachings of Torah Kabala. Due to his teaching and activities, the Ottoman authorities expelled him from Smyrna (Izmir), whereupon he wandered through Greece, Thrace, Palestine and Egypt. In 1665 he met charismatic Nathan of Gaza, who persuaded him that he was indeed The Messiah. Sebatai Zevi then formerly revealed himself, named 1666 as the millennium, and soon gained fervent support in Palestine and in the Diaspora. It was the only messianic movement to engulf the whole world of Jewry: from England to Iran, from Germany to Morocco, from Poland to Yemen. Sebatai attempted to land in Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1666, but was captured and imprisoned by the Turkish authorities. He was forced to convert to Islam to escape persecution, and many of his followers also converted to Islam. Thousands of his followers in Turkey and elsewhere in the Middle East still secretly worship him as The Messiah, under the guise of either a Muslim/Donmeh or a Christian. The majority of Jews call the followers of this sect heretics. TURKISH FREEMASONS & FOLLOWERS OF SEBATAISTS Turkish Freemasons and Followers of the Sebataists: Turkish right-winger Ozcan Soysal asked the following question: Who are we? And where are we from? Are we natives or newcomers? He continues, Among those ethnic groups the followers of the Sebataist/Convert Jews are the most difficult ones to identify or spot, since they appear to be practicing the religion of Islam, adopt Turkish names, adopt Turkish culture and traditions; at the same time, they remain as secretly practicing Jews. For secularist and Western-minded persons, this kind of dialogue appears to be preposterous, yet in the minds of Turkish extremists it is an important issue, since they don't trust in the loyalty of those who don't carry pure Turkish blood! And they should be identified since they are not trustworthy! According to the Turksih right-wingers and the credo of the Islamic Party, Freemasons and Sebataist Donmehs are responsible for the destruction of the Ottoman Empire. They claim that the Selanik (Salonica) Masonic Lodge, controlled by Sebataist Donmehs, toppled the Caliphate of Sultan Abdulhamid II and destroyed the Ottoman Empire, leading to the establishment of the secular Turkish Republic, which again fell under the control of the Freemasons and Sebataists. They claim the Caliphate and the base of Islam was destroyed and the control of the country was left to Masonic and Sebataist elements. Far-fetched accusations? Unsubstantiated allegations? This is not something for readers to decide; it needs to be analyzed and scrutinized by the academics and scholars. According to the Turkish extremist, The Grand Orient of Turkey was formed in 1908. In April 1909, the Young Turks - which was entirely a Convert/Donmeh (Islamized Jewish) movement - rose in revolt and engineered Abdulhamid II's deposition. The statement continues: From that time until his death on February the 11th 1918, Abdulhamid II was a state captive. These events fulfill, to the letter, the prophecy of Rasullah that 70,000 sons of Isaac (Semitic Jews) would conquer Constantinople without a shot being fired or a blow being stuck. Within six years, by the Great War (1914-1918), then the Arab revolt which would enter every Arab house, followed by mutual hostilities between the Arabs and Turks. What are these Turkish-Islamist extremists alluding to? That Freemasons, controlled by the Sebataist/Donmeh, intentionally destroyed the Ottoman Empire and the Caliphate, whose head was the Ottoman Sultan. WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR ARMENIAN GENOCIDE? According to Turkish-Islamic extremists, Hidden Jews/Donmeh-Convert Jews or Sebataists were responsible for the Armenian Genocide, since there was a turf battle and rivalry between Armenians and Jews to control the Ottoman trade, commerce and banking. In order to eliminate the Armenian factor, Donmehs instigated the Armenian massacres. It is a convenient way for Turkish extremists to redirect the responsibility of guilt for the Armenian Genocide to others (Jews); this way, they are exonerating themselves while smearing their hated targets, the Jews. Brilliant Turkish tactics! Turkish-Islamic extremists mention the names of the following Freemasons as leaders controlled by Donmehs and as belonging to Selonica (Selanik) Masonic Lodge. Those are men who are known for having organized and perpetrated the Armenian Genocide: Panturkist ideologue Ziya Gokalp, Minister of Interior Talat Pasha, Minister of Navy Cemal Pasha, Minister of Finance Donmeh Cavity Bey, Minister of Finance Tefik Bey, Ittihadist Mithat Sukru Bleda, Behaettin Sakir etc. Following the establishment of the Turkish Republic, the following anti-Armenian Freemasons are noteworthy: Prime Minister Hasan Saka, Prime Minister Suat Hayri Urguplu, Deputy Prime Minister Mumtaz Okmen, Foreign Minister with Iddihadist credentials Tefik Rustu Aras, Selim Sarper, Minister of the Interior with Ittihadist credentials, Sukru Kaya. ATATURK TOO A DONMEH The most explosive allegation is made by Turkish-Islamic extremist Ali Riza Sakli. According to him, Turkish general, statesman and founder of the Turkish Republic Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (1881-1938), who was born in Selanik (Salonica), had Jewish blood. His parents were Donmeh, belonging to the underground sect of Sebataists. According to the Islamists, Ataturk once confessed that he was Freemason and a descendant of Sebatai Zevi but not indeed a Jew anymore, and rather an ardent admirer of the Prophet Moses. In the same interview with Itamar Ben-Avi, son of Elizer Ben-Yehuda, the leading promoter of the revival of the spoken Hebrew in late 19th-century Palestine, Mustafa Kemal confessed, I have at home a Hebrew Bible printed in Venice. It's rather old, and I remember my father bringing me to a Karaite teacher who taught me to read it. Ataturk pauses for a minute and recites, Shema Yisrael, Adonai Elohenu, Adonai Ehad. For a long time, Turkish-Islamic extremists have been trying to discredit Mustafa Kemal Ataturk for his actions, like eliminating the Caliphate, closing Islamic schools, hanging Mullahs, proclaiming secularism and westernization programs, changing the language and the alphabet, and emancipating the women from Islamic fundamentalist tyranny. According to the claim of some friends of Ataturk, when some people in their minds were associating his birthplace with non-Turkish ethnicity, thereby insinuating that most people from Selanik were Donmeh Jews, he wouldn't deny it. His answer was that Napoleon Bonaparte was an Italian from Corsica, but he became a French general and emperor, leading France to glory, and he died as a Frenchman. His analogy was a clear indication of his admission about his Jewish ancestry, according to Turkish-Islamic extremists. CONTINUING DISCREDITATION The same sources today are trying to discredit Former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, Former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, Former Minister of Economy Kemal Dervish, Rahsan Ecevit (wife of Primer Minister Bulent Ecevit), Cahit Arif, Orhan Pamuk, and Coskun Kirca for having Sebataist and Donmeh roots. In turn, Islamist foes are asking the following legitimate question, if a Kurd is called a Mountain Turk, why not call him a Donmeh Turk, as Rahsan Ecevit stated? This is the weakness of the Turkish Islamist extremists. They are dividing people based on their ethnic backgrounds, as Pure Turks, Converts/Donmehs, Kurds, Laz (Islamized Georgians), Cherkez (Islamized Circassians), Gurcu (Georgian), Rum (Greek), Yahudi (Jew) and Ermeni (Armenian), without realizing that if they go through the selection and elimination methods, they will end up with handful of slanty-eyed, high cheek-boned Turkic-Mongols. It will be interesting to watch the upcoming Turkish elections and see where these smear tactics will lead them - into the European Union or isolation from the rest of the civilized world.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-09-07,1
"She was a Saint! cried out her Muslim neighbors as they followed her coffin into the crowded Christian Armenian Church in Aleppo. The sudden death of Mrs. Loucin Kjoian Bedian on June 15, 2002 left everyone in shock. This remarkable deep blue-eyed human being had helped so many for so long, yet typical of her, she burdened no one as she departed so suddenly, without any warning. Born in November 1929 in Aiybez (now in Turkey), Loucin Bedian was one of the four children of Kevork and Nouritsa Kjoian who had direct ancestral descent from Karabagh (Artsakh). Although she belonged to a generation of Armenians without childhood, the inner strength of these deprived children made the Diaspora survive and thrive. The energy-filled Loucin studied hard to become the head nurse at the then-Altounian Hospital in Aleppo, Syria. Because of her rosy cheeks and purple blue eyes, she would always be assigned to the most ill in that hospital - perhaps to ease the pain of the suffering with her lively smile. Sure enough, her fate brought her to care for a very sick young man whose charming eyes were all that were left of his fragile body. The year was 1950 and the young man was Hovhannes Bedian. The ensuing difficult journey of this young couple undoubtedly helped in shaping the next generation of Armenians in the Middle East. Just newly wed in 1952, Hovhannes and Loucin Bedian set out on a most difficult journey to the remote northern Syrian village of Derbesieh (near Kameshli), to run the Armenian school newly opened by the Armenian General Benevolent Union. The harsh conditions did not prevent this dedicated couple from giving their utmost to the entire Armenian population of the town whose demise was certain if it had not been for Hovhannes and Loucin Bedian. They were not just the principals or teachers at the school, but became the inspiration and symbol for Armenian survival and revival. After 15 years of dedicated service, when the AGBU decided to close down the schools as the number of Armenians began to dwindle, the Bedians worked tirelessly and managed to repatriate the remaining Derbesieh Armenians to Armenia, in 1966. The couple returned to Aleppo where they continued teaching the Armenian language and history. Loucin Kjoian Bedian's own life was full of tragedies and sadness. In the turbulent year of 1958 in Beirut, Lebanon, her two young brother, Levon and Bedros Kjoian were gunned down by fellow Armenians as they innocently walked to their work. Her deeply wounded parents and sister Maida repatriated to Armenia to find some comfort in the Homeland. Her husband, Hovhannes Bedian, succumbed to cancer in 1977. Yet the tragedies seemed to only strengthen Loucin Bedian's resolve to help the needy and the weak. From 1972 to 1999 she served as a representative for Ananoun Parerar (anonymous philanthropist, later known as Jinishian and the Karagheusian Foundation. Her work took her to hundreds of young widows and orphaned children adopted and helped by these charitable organizations. She gave comfort, education and even physical help to all. They loved and prayed for their humble angel. Loucin Bedian is survived by her two loving children, Maral Bedian Papazian and Viken Bedian, and two grandchildren, Aren and Nrani Bedian, Joining them in mourning are her son-in-law, Artur Papazian, and daughter-in-law, Maria Mouradian Bedian, and many relatives and thousands of friends and colleagues. They will all remember and cherish this remarkable selfless lady with sad deep-blue eyes. May her tortured but strong Karabaghian soul now rest in peace next to her equally strong companion, Hovhannes Bedian. Photograph (Hovhannes & Loucin)",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2002-08-31,1
"Turk reformers under the rule of Sultan Mahmut II (1808-1839) and Sultan Abdulmecit I (1839-1861), in order to modernize the decaying Ottoman state, tried to adopt European ways. The Ottoman reformers began to restructure the government apparatus, military, navy, provincial administration, education and news media, yet met stiff resistance from the traditionalist, reactionary and extremist forces; as a consequence, reforms failed. During the rule of the paranoid Sultan Abdulhamit II (1876-1909), all the previous changes were rescinded, autocracy was established, censorship was imposed, the power of the Parliament (Medjlis' i Mebusan) was undermined, and reformers and intellectuals were persecuted. He successfully used palace informers to spy on citizens, intellectuals and reformers, eliminated all the opposition and formed the anti-Armenian Hamidiye cavalry to brutalize Armenians in the provinces, and organized Armenian massacres in Adana. The Young Turks (1908-1918), accusing Abdulhamit II of despotism, forced him to relinquish most of his powers, on the pretext of establishing the so-called Ottoman constitutional democracy (1909-1911). The Young Turks were great admirers of the German militarists, and followers of the Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist ideology. Their so-called reforms stipulated the purification of the Ottoman state from its unwanted elements (minorities) and they gave the orders to deport and annihilate the entire Armenian population (1915-1918). With the conclusion of WWI, the Ottoman state collapsed and surrendered to the Entente Powers; the terms of the armistice went into effect on October 31, 1918. 100 YEARS OF FAILED ATTEMPTS In the hundred-year period from 1808 until 1908, all attempts to Europeanize or to Germanize the Ottoman Empire brought only cosmetic changes, mostly benefiting the military, autocrats, bureaucrats, and ruling elite. Indeed, none of the common Ottoman citizens saw any relaxation in government bureaucracy and arbitrary rule, and basic human rights violations and discrimination against minorities, political activists and advocates of democratization continued. The ruling elite blamed the minorities in order to cover up the state's own failure to improve the economy, to prevent reversals in foreign policy and several military defeats in all fronts. These setbacks fuelled Turkish nationalism, rekindled anti-minority sentiments, which had far-reaching and fatal consequences on the Armenian and Greek minorities, and finally led to the destruction of the entire Ottoman-Armenian population. Under Kemalist nationalists, between 1918-1923, the Turks were waging their own war of independence against interventionist forces, Greeks, British, French and Italians. After their triumph over occupying forces, they concluded the final peace agreement with the Treaty of Lausanne on July 24, 1923. The Turkish Republic was declared on October 29, 1923 and Mustafa Kemal Ataturk was elected by the Grand National Assembly the first president. The dictatorship of the Ataturk era started in 1923 and continued until his untimely death on November 10, 1938. Ataturk's reforms abolished the Ottoman sultanate and caliphate, and established the new Turkish nation based on the principles of republicanism, nationalism, state ownership, revolutionist reformism and secularism. Ataturk ruled with an iron hand; anyone that dared to oppose his reforms and rules was hanged in the public square. Wishing to Europeanize his nation, he gave them a new identity, history, alphabet, dress codes, national assembly. He nationalized railroads, shipping, airlines, and certain sectors of heavy industry to eliminate foreign and minority role in the Turkish economy and industry, and kept religion our of politics. His Westernization didn't go beyond structural changes, since the state, under the one-party system, continued to control and monitor citizen activities, while limiting the freedom of speech and expression. Censorship of news media continued, and radio broadcasts remained under state control. He continued to curtail personal liberties and minority rights and brutally suppressed the Kurdish uprising in 1925. After Ataturk's death, his loyal lieutenant Ismet Inonu assumed the presidency. His rule between 1938-1950 was characterized by an anti-minority policy. Under his dictatorship, the opposition was silenced, the Kurdish uprising was again brutally suppressed, Kurdish nationalist leaders were executed, the use of Kurdish language, songs and national dress was banned, and offenders were imprisoned. During WWII the Turkish government maintained evasive neutrality yet the rise of Turkish nationalism was manifested by the assignment of former Ittihadists to important government positions. Turkey continued to collaborate with Nazi Germany and refused to give permission to the Allied forces, British and Americans, to lend support to the beleaguered Soviet army, under the Nazi siege. He imposed the infamous, astronomical Capital Tax against Greeks, Armenians and Jews, forcing them into bankruptcy, and confiscated their land and properties. DECADE OF DEMOCRATS The so-called Democratic Year, 1950-1960 started with the election of Celal Bayar as President, Adnan Menderes as Prime Minister and Fuat Koprulu as Foreign Minister, who were representatives of the old-guard civil servants, with middle-class background and intellectual credentials. The Democrats had the support of the Kurds, who suddenly realized that they had voting power. The Kurdish involvement in active politics created a backlash and reaction from the far-rightists, nationalistic forces and military, fearing Kurdish ascendancy to power. This backlash led to armed confrontation between Turkish and Kurdish nationalist forces, causing anarchy and thirty thousands of deaths. The Turkish military and economy became modernized through massive American and Western help and, after Turkey's entry into NATO in 1952, it enjoyed most-favored status in Washington as a forward base against the U.S.S.R. At the height of the ColdWar era, the Turkish ruling elite, the generals, continued to violate human rights and persecuted political and Kurdish dissidents, yet Western countries and the U.S. conveniently kept mum about the generals' misrule. Reforms under the Democrats didn't eliminate censorship; curtailment of the freedom of speech and expression continued, and political and Kurdish dissidents were constantly silenced. Yet, influenced by the Red Scare during the Cold War period, Western governments and the U.S. refrained from criticizing successive Turkish governments for human rights violations and misrule and prevented the implementation of serious reforms. The Kurdish issue was considered a destabilizing factor and remained problematic. Invoking national security concerns, the Turkish generals, with Washington's blessings, staged three open military coups. The first coup took place on May 27, 1960, when the generals deposed Prime Minister Adnan Menderes, Interior Minister Namik Gedik and Foreign Minister Fatin Rustu Zorlu on charges of violating the Turkish Constitution. All three were hanged at the gallows. The second coup took place on March 12, 1971 when Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel was deposed. The third coup was staged on September 12, 1980 and both former Prime Ministers Suleyman Demirel and Bulent Ecevit were detained. The generals also deposed Prime Minister Necmeddin Erbakan in 1998, again invoking violation of Kemalist principles as justification. THE SITUATION TODAY After a brief review of the so-called reform movements and political developments from 1808 to 1998m let's see what is happening today. Turkey is in a deep political crisis. Its economy is in shambles, unable to feed or find jobs for its ever-expanding population that now stands at 68 million; it is on the verge of social explosion. Skyrocketing inflation, unemployment, the widening gap between the rich and poor, and harsh living conditions are forcing Turks to migrate internally to urban areas and externally to foreign countries to find jobs. A new breed of intellectuals and Europeanized politicians like the former Foreign Minister Ismail Cem, former Deputy Prime Minister Husamettin Ozkan and State Minister Kemal Dervis have joined together to form a new democratic-left alliance. Their resignation prompted the defection of some 40-odd Parliament members from the coalition government led by Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. During the upcoming election on November 18, 2002, which was called early, their platform will be to organize reforms to join the European Union instead of just Europeanize. These rebellious Turks actually want to practice what they are dreaming of! So far, the mighty generals are staying on the sidelines and watching the political developments. This past weekend, the Turkish Parliament voted, 256 to 162 with one abstention, for reform measures mandated by European Union Ascendancy Rules, known as Copenhagen Criteria. In this reform package, Turkey is supposed to abide by the rules: To abolish the death penalty during peacetime (but it will NEW ENGLAND NEWS - NEW ENGLAND NEWS - NEW ENGLAND NEWS Sremain in effect in times of war). To lift certain restrictions on people's right to associate or form civic organizations. To impose stricter penalties for human trafficking. To allow Kurds, 12-18 million strong, the right to broadcast and teach the Kurdish language. To allow non-Muslim minorities, such as Greeks, Armenians and Jews, greater rights over religious properties such as churches. For months, debates on these issues have divided and paralyzed the coalition government led by veteran Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit. These concessions, like being able to speak one's mother language, to publish papers or broadcast radio programs in that language, or religious communities being able to renovate or expand their properties, acquire new buildings or accept charity donations, are nothing major; they are simple basic rights protected in any civil society. THREAT OF NATIONALISTS LOOMING The Turkish Parliamentarians are now finally conceding that there have been serious shortcomings that, until now, disqualified Turks from becoming Europeanized. Yet, Turkish nationalists, led by Deputy Prime Minister Devlet Bahceli and Nationalist Party Deputy Bozkurt Yasar Ozturk, vowed that if they are elected in November, they will overturn the recent Parliament vote. They assert that these proposed changes, in particular granting Kurds the right to speak and teach their own language, will fuel separatism among Turkey's largest minority, 12 to 18 million strong. Well, they may have a legitimate fear, but their advocacy is considered to be illegitimate in European eyes, where human rights and democratic standards are even higher than in the U.S. Reforms, reforms and reforms, democratization, democratization and democratization, words, words and words, this is all Turks have been hearing since 1808. Those of us who lived through several Turkish revolutions and heard empty promises of democratization and freedom; yet when tried to test it, we found that nothing had changed and that we were confronted with threats, persecution, imprisonment or physical disappearance. Many intellectuals, political dissidents and activists, journalists, and community leaders lost their lives, families, communities and even the entire Armenian nation was persecuted and murdered for believing those pseudo-reformers. Time will tell if the Turks will finally Europeanize and democratize. If this indeed happens, then the Turks' reconciliation with their history, including reconciliation with Armenians, will become a reality. Most of us are skeptical but hopeful. Past experiences and the track record of Turkey on these issues are not very promising but, who knows, maybe this new breed to Turkish reformers will be able to keep their promises to the Turkish nation, which is long overdue.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2002-08-31,1
"The First public showing of the one-hour video documentary, Memories of Marash, took place before a more than capacity audience on Thursday evening, June 13, at the Center and Headquarters of the National Association for Armenian Studies and Research here. The video traces the history of the city of Marash, today part of Turkey, from ancient times through the massacres of the late 1800s to 1923 and the final expulsion of the Armenian community by the Turks. The video is the work of Roger K. Hagopian of Lexington, MA, a self-taught filmmaker and former music teacher who runs his own carpet and upholstery cleaning business. One of Hagopian's earlier works, Journey Along the Middlesex Canal, has been shown at Tufts University, Bunker Hill Community College, and the Lowell National Park Visitor's Center. Memories of Marash is Hagopian's second video on an Armenian subject. The first, The Journey of an Armenian Family, The Struggle of a Nation, was shown as part of the April 1999 Genocide Commemoration program at NAASR. INTERVIEWS WITH MARASH NATIVES Memories of Marash is composed of interviews with Marash natives, including Genocide survivors, as well as their children, and experts on the subjects of Marash and Cilicia. It includes family and historical photographs, archival and recent footage of Marash, as well as authentic music from Marash, provided by Prof. Leon Janikian of Watertown and Northeastern University, who also provides commentary. Among the wide variety of topics touched upon in the video are aspects of the everyday life of residents of Marash, as recollected by interviewees such as the Rev. Vartan Hartunian of Belmont and the late Richard Parseghian, each of whom was born in Marash. One characteristic of the homes they recalled was the presence of running water in nearly all of the homes in Marash - usually a stream of water from the mountains channeled to serve as a supply for homes. Peter Bilezikian of Newton, another Marash native, recalled that because most of the business in Marash were in the hands of Armenians, all commerce in the city ceased on Sunday, while the shops stayed open on Friday, the Muslim Sabbath. MANY ASPECTS OF LIFE IN MARASH ADDRESSED Other subjects discussed were typical clothing worn by the various strata of society, sources of food, health conditions, and the Marash dialect of Armenian. Of the latter, Prof. Janikian observed that although the Marash dialect was not pure in that it contained many Turkish words and phrases, this was simply a reflection of the reality of Armenians in this region. The people simple spoke the way the conditions of their life dictated. Susan Lind-Sinanian of the Armenian Library and Museum of America in Watertown provided an informative segment on the distinctive and intricate lacework which is associated with Marash and which, like the Marash dialect, is gradually dying out. An important aspect of life in Marash from the ate 19th century on was the presence of American and European Protestant and Catholic missionaries. The missionaries, in addition to spreading their faiths in Ottoman Armenia, also brought education and Western ideas, which did much to spur Armenians to seek greater freedoms. Among the important institutions established by the missionaries were the Marash Girl's College and the Bethel orphanage, both of which were discussed at length in the video. THE GENOCIDE AND ITS AFTERMATH In addition to detailing the expulsion and killings of Armenians during the 1915 Genocide, Hagopian also chronicled the fate of the thousands of Armenians who returned to Marash after the war had ended. With the promise of protection by Allied forces, the Marash Armenians attempted to rebuild their lives. However, this promise was betrayed in 1920 when the French forces guaranteeing the Armenians' safety withdrew from Marash, with thousands of Armenians following in their wake, trudging through a heavy snowstorm. Many of them never made it to their destination. As Rev. Hartunian said in the video, We were expendable. Many Marash Armenians who escaped with their lives finally settled in Lebanon and later came to America. Following the video, Hagopian introduced participants in the video who were in attendance that evening and took numerous questions from the audience. NAASR Board Chairman Nancy R. Kolligian presented Hagopian with a gift certificate and a copy of Dickran Boyajian's book. The Armenian Legion.

"7,100 miles east of my hometown of Rehoboth, Massachusetts lies the small country of Armenia. No bigger than the state of Maryland, Armenia is a historically rich country in the Middle East/Asia Minor region. I am the great-grandson of Armenian immigrants, whom I never knew but whose beliefs and values have lived on through two generations and have impacted my life. This rich heritage and our valued traditions led my mother, my brother, and me to Armenia in the summer of 2005. Our journey began on July 31 with an international flight to Paris, France. During our eight-hour layover, I had the opportunity to use my language skills by speaking French while touring the sights of Paris. Although we were tired and jetlagged, it was on to the next phase of our trip where my mother would serve as the family interpreter. Our first stop in Yerevan, Armenia was the Genocide Memorial commemorating the victims of the 1915 Genocide. Was it emotion or the many time zones through which I had traveled that left me feeling weak? For the next several days it was a non-stop schedule of sightseeing community service at a local orphanage, and nightlife with the locals. Our first week was filled with excitement and awe at seeing firsthand the customs, language, and food, which are a part of my daily life in America. Our second week began with a grueling nine-hour mountainous bus ride to Nagorno Karabagh, a Muslim enclave of Azerbaijan, inhabited primarily by Christian Armenians. Was it the change in altitude or the constant hairpin turns, which made my stomach churn? I never left my hotel room during our mountain stay. On Wednesday, August 10, I found myself unable to face the bus ride back to Yerevan. A local doctor determined my blood pressure was dangerously low and I was too weak to travel but perhaps some sugar and caffeine would energize me. After my mother made a frantic phone call home to her sister, a physician, I was given Coca-Cola candy, and good strong soorj, Armenian coffee, to prevent further dehydration and raise my blood pressure. Rocketing down the mountainside without stopping for lunch, we arrived in Yerevan six hours later. I was immediately taken to Nairi Medical Center, a brand-new state-of-the-art hospital. Upon admittance, I was found to be severely underweight, gaunt with gray pallor, and weak. The gastroenterologist performed a sonogram to determine the cause of my weight loss. Good news: the sonogram was negative; however, shakar patsvilê. Speaking Armenian, the doctor told my mother there were ketones present in my urine and my blood glucose level was 400, which led her to diagnose me with diabetes. I did not understand a word she had said. I was placed in room 410, given a shot of insulin, and within 45 minutes began to feel better. For the remaining five days of our trip, my mother and I came to call Nairi our home away from home. We were in a foreign country, yet we were not foreigners. Our days were filled with lengthy discussions comparing the American healthcare system with our treatment at Nairi, including conversations regarding educational pathways into medical careers, and, of course, hospital food, which is universal. I used Russian insulin and was taught to give myself injections while my mother passed out American toilet ries and cosmetics to all of my nurses. Along with my health, my medical terminology in Armenian also improved while at Nairi. When asked, Hagopjan (my Armenian name followed by a term of endearment), vonts es? (Jacob, how are you?), I could respond Shad lav, shunorhagaloutiun (Very well, thank you). I could even ask if I were to receive long- or short-acting insulin. We left Nairi Medical Center by ambulance at 3:30 a.m. on Monday, August 15, and arrived at Logan Airport at 4:00 p.m. the same day. I was immediately transported to Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence, Rhode Island. The doctors, impressed by the treatment I had received in Armenia, confirmed the diagnosis. Beyond my medical care, I was treated like an international star. I willingly donated the remainder of my Russian insulin and, quite often, when awakened in the middle of the night, reverted to my newfound language in thanking the nurses. Armenia had gotten into my blood. Throughout this ordeal, my heritage has taught me to be thankful for all that I am, including being diabetic. I am a third-generation Armenian-American. I have a close-knit family who have held steadfast to ancient customs blended with American life. We have dealt with genocide and language barriers, which have made us stronger. I have used these lessons to remain strong in my daily struggle with diabetes. Once again, the values of my great-grandparents have touched my life. Their deep commitment to education has reinforced my desire to pursue medicine, and their homeland will always remain my sweet Armenia.

"WARSAW--The reprinting in one of the leading Polish dailies of caricatures depicting Mohammed, the Muslim prophet, has lead to an apology by the Foreign Minister to the Arab world and a debate about the limits of free expression. Under the title Freedom of expression is not a provocation, the Feb. 3 weekend edition of Rzeczpospolita--considered one of the most serious and opinion forming Polish newspapers--carried a reprint of the controversial cartoon pictures published by some Danish and Norwegian dailies. Grzegorz Gauden, Rzeczpospolita's editor, stated the reprint had been a form of protest against aggressive reactions from radical Islamic groups to the original publications. Threats of bomb attacks and rewards for assassinating the cartoon authors is obviously impermissible. That is the opinion of numerous European media. Our newspaper wanted to be in solidarity with this stand. The Polish head of diplomacy, Stefan Meller, acknowledged the right to free expression, but admitted to abusing religious feelings of the Muslim community. I would like to ask all the ambassadors of Arab countries accredited in Warsaw to relay to their respective societies that bearing in mind Poland's traditionally friendly disposition towards them, the situation is a misunderstanding created by a reprint of material contained in other European press. While no anti-Polish reactions have been reported either in Lebanon, or from other Arab countries, Poland's Muslim Religious Union has announced it would be taking the Rzeczpospolita newspaper to court for the reprint of the controversial caricatures of prophet Mohammed on grounds of offending religious feelings and symbols.

"FOR an hour or so last Friday the normally peaceful Stephen's Green area in the center of Dublin looked a bit like Teheran. Around 500 Muslims, many in traditional dress and with long beards, marched around the Green protesting against the Danish cartoons, waving their fists in the air and chanting slogans about the Prophet. A large banner in the front of the protest read: Thank U Irish newspapers for not repeating the insult to Islam. Naturally - if you think like a Muslim - the protesters were all men. (Maybe the women were at home knitting their burkas.) But by the standards of what has been going on elsewhere at least the Dublin protest was peaceful, even if there was a lot of angry shouting and waving of fists in the air. The locals looked on with a slightly scornful amusement. It must have added a surreal edge to the day's fashion shopping on Grafton Street. The Gardai (police) did not allow the marchers to stop outside the Danish Embassy which is on Stephen's Green. So at the main entrance to the Green the marchers sat down and speeches were made. The main speaker said that although Muslims were hurt and deeply offended by the cartoons, they condemned the violent reaction across the world We thank the Irish people for not republishing these offensive cartoons and thereby damaging community relations, he said. This was in keeping with the general reaction of Muslims here. And that was recognized and encouraged by the Irish government, with ministers publicly thanking the Muslim community for protesting peacefully. Although why ministers should be publicly thanking people for NOT breaking the law is beyond me. But it was in marked contrast to the mayhem going on elsewhere, not just in places like Syria and Iran and Indonesia, but to a lesser extent across Europe. Even in Britain, the huge protest marches featured banners calling for the cartoonists to be beheaded, and one marcher cavorted around wearing a mock suicide bomber belt, watched tolerantly by British bobbies. It was in this difficult international environment that Irish President Mary McAleese found herself in Saudi Arabia last weekend, attending the three-day Jeddah Economic Forum with Cherie Blair (Mrs. Tony), Al Gore, Gerhard Schroeder and other notables. Now in situations like this McAleese always reminds me of Maggie Thatcher - she doesn't know when to shut up. So at her press conference there, instead of coming out with a few diplomatic platitudes she lost the run of herself in an emotional effort to please. The cartoons had been designed to provoke, to hurt, to inflame, she said, and Ireland abhorred their publication. Now I was around Dublin over the weekend and I did not meet anyone who abhorred the publication of the cartoons. They might abhor the price of housing here or the state of our public transport, but Danish cartoons are way down the abhorring list. What they did abhor about the cartoons, however, was the wildly exaggerated, orchestrated reaction to them across much of the Muslim world. The biggest and most violent reactions were in places like Syria and Iran, where you can't swing a cat without government approval. You don't get tens of thousands of people on the streets over there unless the regime is behind it. People in Dublin I met were asking questions like how someone in Indonesia or Iran would have seen a cartoon in a small Danish newspaper that no one outside Denmark had ever heard of before? And since the cartoons had actually appeared last September, why had the reaction erupted so long afterwards, and at the same time in so many places? And there was a lot of sympathy for the Danes, a liberal and generous people who, among other things, have welcomed Muslim immigrants into their society for years and who have been one of the biggest European donors to Palestinian charities. And who happen to believe in the importance of free speech. So McAleese's opinion that Irish people abhorred the publication of the cartoons in Denmark was completely wrong. And so was her opinion that the cartoons had been designed to provoke, to hurt, to inflame. Nobody I know here thinks that. What they do think is that the cartoons were a lame attempt at pointing up the way Islamic fundamentalists merge religion and extreme violence in their campaign to turn the world Muslim. The general view here is that the cartoons were making a political point rather than being funny. They were crass, not very well drawn and not very funny. But they were making a serious comment that had nothing to do with provoking, hurting, or inflaming and there was no reason for them not to be published. Only one newspaper here had the courage to publish one of the cartoons (The Star) and it reproduced the one showing the Prophet wearing turban style headgear that was in fact a smoking bomb. Like the government, most newspapers here took the pragmatic view that it was better to let sleeping dogs lie (and no, that's not an insult to Muslims, it's a figure of speech). And they felt that the cartoons were so ordinary that they were not worth republishing anyway. The reality is, as we all know only too well, this is not about the cartoons at all. It's not about whether the cartoons were a lame and obvious comment on Islamic extremism or a deliberate insult to Muslims so grave that it justified the international rioting and deaths we have seen in the last week. The reality is that this is not about free speech either. It's not about whether our western concept of free speech ought to be exercised within limits that show more respect for the different mindset of the Islamic world. How can it be about these things? The Islamic fundamentalists do not understand the concept of political humor, so cartoons like this are simply beyond their understanding. Even less do they understand the concept of free speech, because their Islamic fundamentalism implies a denial of all kinds of freedoms, one of which is free speech. No, it's not about the propriety of the cartoons or any supposed abuse of free speech. It's not even about the alleged gross insult to the Prophet, supposedly so appalling that it can lead to mass hysteria that compels young boys to slash their own heads with razors for the cameras (while their fathers look on approvingly). It's not really about that. It's about much more than either of those things. What this is about is hatred of the west, of western values and freedoms, of the basic democratic principles on which our western society is built. What it is about is cynical opportunism, using something of miniscule significance as an excuse for letting loose an international torrent of underlying hatred. Just a few weeks ago I wrote in this column about the reasons why, in spite of all the difficulties, America was right to go into Iraq. The same reasons help to explain the present situation. What I said then was, The conquest of the Middle East and much of Asia is not going to be enough for the fundamentalist lunatics. Their ultimate aim is the destruction of the infidel societies in the west they hate so much. They want to destroy the democracies we have created and replace them with the Caliphate, the fundamentalist Islamic empire, which will eventually be expanded around the world. That is the reality western civilization faces. You don't often get to see this agenda because the Muslim fanatics are very good at keeping it hidden. But every now and then the ultimate aim pops out. That, more than anything else, is what we have seen in the cartoon controversy over the past week. McAleese in her comments in Saudi Arabia did talk about Ireland's belief in free speech and in robust but peaceful argument. But she went much too far in sympathizing with Muslims about a supposedly appalling insult that had been thrown at their Prophet. Of course, her speech may mean that lots of Kerrygold butter and Irish cheeses will replace the absent Danish dairy produce in Muslim supermarkets over there. But do we really want to sacrifice free speech for that? And do we understand where this is heading? It's way past time when western democracies stopped biting their tongues and making allowances for Muslim objections to all kinds of things like free speech and women's rights (the Saudi women at McAleese's lecture were behind a screen). We have our values. Either we defend them or we lose them. And if we ever do lose them you won't be reading anything like this when the Caliphate rules the world. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"Having no shame, the International Turkish Societies Federation (ITSF), fully supported and perhaps instigated by Ankara, plans to erect a monument in New York City that they call the Armenian Terror Monument. A spokesperson for the ITSF stated that, for years, the international community has been deceived by Armenian Diaspora lies. So the errant deniers, the Turks, have embarked on a crusade, announcing recently that it is high time to talk the truths. We are establishing a committee of Turkish architects and historians to build the most original monument which will send a strong message about Armenian terrorist organization ASALA atrocities against Turkish diplomats and relatives. PLAY ON AMERICAN CONCERN ABOUT TERRORISM The intent of the ITSF is not to portray the truth, for it does not know what the truth means. What the ITSF intends to do is to play on the American concern about terrorism after 9/11, particularly in New York City, where the two great buildings came crashing to earth in dust and debris, killing over 3,000 innocent Americans. It is a shameless and obscene attempt to depict all Armenians as terrorists, especially those Armenians in the Diaspora. The ITSF wants to make a direct connection between the Muslim fanatics, who crashed the planes into the World Trade Center, and Armenians, What they wish to do is to divert attention from the true facts about the Genocide, which are becoming more widely known and acknowledged, to terrorism, which is of enormous concern in this day and age. In this manner, the denier Turks want to obfuscate what their parents, grandparents and Turkish national icons did. They do not want to reveal that modern Turkey has been built upon massive ethnic cleansing and genocide. If the latter happens, the Turks understand that the reputation of their patron saint, Kemal Ataturk, will be sullied. What these denier Turks do not realize is that erecting the monument will suck Kemal Pasha into the terrorist nest. It will lead to honest scholars re-examining what terrorism means in a broad context. The phony court trials of Kurds held under Kemal (that were rigged for execution of Kurdish leaders) will reveal that state terrorism began on a state level in Ankara in the 20th century, ala Kemal Pasha justice and nationalism. It will also lead to a re-evaluation of what happened to Talaat Pasha and how a German court found the assassin of Talaat, the mass murderer of Armenians, free of guilt. ITSF IS MISREADING NEW YORKERS The ITSF thinks that New York will sit back and allow the Turks to decide which scholars will define the truth. These Turks assume that New York, will simply dismiss what true scholars have examined and proclaimed, and what practically every governor of the state and mayor, of New York City has proclaimed over the years: simply put, it was Genocide, stupid. That is, if New York City would even allow any such denier monument to be erected on its streets. Go ahead, denier Turks, and see if the Armenians in the New York area do not tie you up in courts for who knows how long for attempting to put a denier spin of terrorism on the Genocide. Every word that will go on this monument will be scrutinized and laid before a judge in an unbiased court, not in a rigged Turkish court. As terrible as the deaths of the Turkish diplomats are/were, they pale in numbers and horror in comparison to the acts of genocide that stimulated the deeds perpetrated by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). By the way, it seems that the Turkish deniers play like a broken record and keep repeating ASALA. The ASALA they knew is gone (for over 20 years) but the deeds that led to their acts of terror still remain. So, which is the greater wrong? If we are to look at the truth, let us look at all the spectra that encompass this issue. UNDERSTANDING ASALA Let us also understand that ASALA was a small contingent made up of radical, activist ethnic Armenians. They were mostly from the Middle East and were not Americans, of whom there were only two groups at the height of the organization's activity. Indeed, most Armenians may have sympathized with their cause, but certainly not with their methods. Had Armenians on the whole advocated violence against the Turks, ASALA may well have remained active as a violent organization for a much longer period of time. But ASALA's methods did not have the support of most Armenians, and that is a major reason why they went out of the violence business. Speaking about terror, its ultimate form is genocide. However, Turkey has practiced a form of terror on its citizens for years, which stops just short of the ultimate terror. Tarn speaking about the torture carried out once anyone falls into the clutches of the police or military interrogators. What about arrests and detention for months without being told what the arrest is for? How about an indefinitely suspended court date? One could go on about Turkey, but the examples make the point. A WELCOME CHALLENGE So, I personally welcome the Turks to challenge the people of New York. As has been prone in their industry of denial, the denier Turks have consistently shot themselves in the foot. Let them gather the McCarthys, Shaws, Lewises, and all of the Turkish denier, pseudo-scholars they can gather. Put them in the New York court and let them spew forth their venom. Let the New York Times cover the court session. Then, after the deniers have left the courtroom (it would not be correct to dignify their presence with the attendance of the honest and proven genocide scholars), bring on the real genocide scholars. Go ahead, ITSF, challenge the people of New York and again make a laughing stock of the government of Turkey and your organization. However ITSF, be careful, you may be hauled into a Turkish court for insulting the Turkish identity under Article 301 of your sick penal code. But you know something, ITSF? Deniers are much too devious to take such a gamble as to have the erection of a monument in New York City refused. Go ahead and roll the dice, but when craps come up, do not say you have not been cautioned. Bring it on. The people of New York are hearty and will battle to keep lies disguised as monuments off of their streets.

"The December 7 Gala Banquet in the rooftop garden room of the Universal Sheraton Hotel here brought guests from near and far to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Haigazian University and to hear the message of Ambassador Edward P. Djerejian, who was enthusiastically introduced by Dr. H. Richard Dekmejian, political science professor and director of the newly established USC Institute of Armenian Studies. The event also commemorated the 42nd anniversary of the Haigazian University Women's Auxiliary of Los Angeles. In attendance was Anahis Derian who, with her husband Henry, pledged the largest single donation of the 50th anniversary, $500,000, through the Armenian Missionary Association of America for future building needs and the Armenian Library. To honor the Derians for their generosity, the Armenian Library will be named the Derian Library. On behalf of the Auxiliary and Honorary Chairs, Auxiliary President Joyce Stein welcomed all of the guests and introduced her husband, Master of Ceremonies Joe Stein, designated by AIM Magazine as Armenian By Choice. Mr. Stein poignantly began the program with a moment of silence to remember the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor exactly 64 years earlier and the devastating 1988 Armenian earthquake 17 years ago to the day. The opening prayer was offered by Rev. Dr. John Khanjian, immediate Past President of Haigazian University, with words of thankfulness to Haigazian for preparing leaders in the Middle East. Charter members of the Auxiliary, Elizabeth Agbabian and Suzie Phillips, were recognized, as well as Maggie Matossian, founder of the Women's Auxiliary in Beirut. Music was provided by the talented Lark Singers led by accomplished Haigazian graduate Vatsche Barsoumian. Winners of the drawing for a rare reproduction of Hovsep Pushman's Dream Pastures were Dr. Hrair and Mary Atikian. In his introduction of Ambassador Djerejian, Dr. Dekmejian explained how difficult it is, first to become a foreign service officer, and then to become an ambassador. He lauded the speaker for becoming our first American Ambassador to Tel Aviv with a non-Jewish background and for his critical work in the peace process, the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, and work on security arrangements in the Middle East. My students should see him as a model to emulate and to go into government service. The Ambassador praised Haigazian University, which, he said, has played a critical and great role in education in the Middle East. He also stressed how important the outcome of the struggle for ideas in the Muslim world would impact all of us and our children. In the early 1990's, he pointed out, we realized we had won the cold war against communism. The next-isms we need to confront are extremism and terrorism ...and we must find a resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Ambassador was presented with a proclamation conferred by California State Assemblyman Chuck Poochigian. Herair Mouradian, President of the Haigazian Board of Trustees, congratulated Haigazian on surviving 15 years of war, relocating three times, and adapting successfully through difficult circumstances. He commended the U.S. and Middle East founders of Haigazian and the Los Angeles Women's Auxiliary, which has raised one million dollars for the University during its 42-year mission.

"It was a great day in Yerevan. September is usually a gorgeous month and, with June, is one of the two most pleasant months of the year. Sitting beneath an umbrella and sipping Armenian coffee, I was reminded of the kheva (soorge in Armenian means coffee) that Oscar Kooloian, my father, and numerous survivors of the Genocide that I grew to love, used to sip beneath our ortod (grape arbor). It was listening to these heroes while sitting beneath the ortod that I first learned that Oscar saved my father from a deadly beating by his Kurdish captor. During the Genocide, the Kurd took my father and told him never to use his name Boghos again, that his name henceforth would be Nuri (a Muslim name). In retelling the story, Oscar brushed his manly mustache and snickered in words to the effect, can anyone imagine a Kurd or Turk telling Boghos (he was said to have been a very fresh kid) that his name is changed? The story goes that my father would not respond when he was called Nuri and that his abductor would beat him with his fists and a strap. As this person was dragging my father down the street in Palou, Oscar spotted our budgo, Oscar's nickname for my father, because my father was short. He ran to the scene, pushed the Kurd from my father, grabbed my father by the hand and they both ran to an American mission and safety. I recall Juvar (Julie), Oscar's wife, a lovely woman who always planted a nice kiss on my cheek, asking Oscar if they were not afraid. Again, Oscar stroked his mustache and laughed, and then he said, After what we went through, we did not know what fear was anymore. My mother arrived in the country as a very young girl (18 or 19) and became very close friends with Digin Juvar even before my mother and father married. ANOTHER VERSION OF DENIAL There were many of those very interesting gatherings. Contrary to some Armenian-American writers' parents, who did not talk about the Genocide, the Paloutsis did talk, and led by Oscar, the expletives in Armenian and Turkish flowed easily. In fact, I did not know that they were swearing words until I used them in front of my parents. It was then that I first heard the phrase, Armenians say. However, that phrase, which appears in numerous US and English newspapers and magazines, has become another version of denial of the Genocide. Obviously, this was not the intent of the survivors sitting under our grapevine. It is becoming increasingly distressful that a newspaper such as the LA Times and magazine such as The Economist, as examples of many, presage statements with Armenians say that 1.5 million Armenians were slaughtered... It is time for honest people and those who wish news reporting to be a bit more accurate, to respond. Genocide scholars may be very busy directly fighting the Turkish government's industry of denial, so the average, honest, interested reader must take note and take some action by sending complaints to the editors. When it comes to the veracity of the Genocide, it is not that Armenians say, but that a plethora of world-renowned experts in the field of genocide studies say, most of who are not ethnic Armenians. I am referring to genuine scholars such as Yehuda Bauer, Frank Chalk, Israel, Charny, Helen Fein, Kurt Jonassohn, Ben Kiernan, Robert J. Lifton, Deborah Lipstadt, Erik Markusen, Robert Melson, R.J. Rummel, and Robert Smith, to name just a handful, who have accomplished exactly what the Turkish government argues must be done. These world-leading non-Armenian genocide scholars have studied the Genocide and made comparisons with other genocides, to include the Holocaust. The conclusions are all the same: 1915 was genocide. The reason I am not highlighting the non-ethnic Armenians is not because I feel that only non-Armenians should have credibility. If Armenian scholars do not have a right and an obligation to study and write about 1915, no one does. The highlight of the non-Armenian scholars is in reaction to the presage in numerous papers and magazines that Armenians say. NEED TO TAKE ISSUE WITH USE OF ARMENIANS SAY The study of the Genocide is not Armenian peculiar. The study of any genocide is not the strict province of any ethnic group. It is a human issue that crosses into many disciplines of study. This is why we all need to take issue with any segment of the media that qualifies their comments with Armenians say. It is particularly obnoxious when the writers also place in the same article that the Turkish government denies it. It is a clever means of stating that there is a controversy and that both sides may have a point. It is reasonable to recognize that Turks may be uneasy about calling their grandparents murderers, but it is not reasonable to state that the murderers may have had justifiable reasons. The Nazis had their sick reasons for getting rid of the Jews, but only a fool, racist, or anti-Semite will attempt to justify it. One does not compare apples and oranges. So why is it appropriate to compare the truth of the Genocide with Turkish government lies that go back to Kemal Ataturk? No one should come to the defense of what the truth is about the Genocide any faster than ethnic Armenians. If Armenians do not defend justice for their own cause in this day and age and under the circumstances that most Armenians live, no one should, because Armenians would not deserve the support. Armenians should neither expect nor desire that non-Armenians lead the charge to defend Armenian identity or the truth about Armenian-Turkish relations, particularly during the Young Turk era and the latter Ottoman era. Thus, when you read Armenians say..., understand that this is another form of denial by making the issue into an Armenian peculiar quirk. It is an insult when it is applied to the Genocide.

"OSKANIAN SPEAKS AT WORLD AFFAIRS COUNCIL, UC BERKELEY RECEPTION, MEETS WITH ANC During his recent visit to San Francisco, Vartan Oskanian, Foreign Minister of Armenia, spoke at the World Affairs Council, was special guest at a reception hosted by the UC Berkeley Armenian Alumni, and met with the Bay Area Armenian National Committee. In his World Affairs Council speech about Statebuilding in the Caucasus, Oskanian discussed Armenia's political and economic development and foreign policy over its 15 years of independence. The democratic process in Armenia is irreversible, said Oskanian. He said the path to a liberal economy and democracy has not been an easy one, the country sometimes taking one step forward and 2 steps back, but that the country continues to move towards a higher level of democracy. As Armenia prepares for a referendum on constitutional reforms on Sunday, Oskanian said the new reforms will provide better checks and balances within the government, enhance the power of parliament and role of political parties, will give more independence to the judicial system, would remove obstructions dual citizenship. Oskanian said that economic reforms have proceeded more smoothly than democratic reforms, pointing out that Armenia was the first among the former Soviet states to move quickly towards privatization. Combined with Armenia's efficient use of foreign aid and economic contributions from the Diaspora, Armenia achieved double-digit growth in each of the last five years. Still it will take greater efficiency and targeted investment to alleviate Armenia's high poverty and unemployment levels. Another indication of Armenia being on the right road economically, said Oskanian, is having become eligible for the Millennium Challenge Account provided by the U.S. to nations showing success in economic liberalization and good governance. Oskanian said that in the early days of independence, Armenia had to decide on its orientation as a state. The only natural choice, given our political and cultural history, was Europe. The integration process into the European structures began in 1992, Armenia became a member of the Council of Europe, and it included in European Union's New Neighborhood policy. Turning to Armenia's security situation, Oskanian said that after the fall of the Soviet Union, We didn't know if we could sustain ourselves. He said Armenians remembered the experience of brief independence in 1918, when the nation fought wars with Turkey and Russia, losing territories in the east and west. Oskanian said Armenia's policy of complementarity, good ties with both Russia and EU and the US has served it well, and that those relationships do not contradict each other. On the prospects of a peace settlement for Karabagh, Oskanian said, The last meetings between the presidents have been very positive. The self-determination option is taking hold. Time is not working to either side's advantage, said Oskanian, pointing out that the lack of a settlement harmed the economies of all sides. Although some have suggested that Azerbaijan may be more inclined to choose a military solution as its oil revenues increase, Oskanian said that no matter how much money Azerbaijan receives from oil, it still wouldn't make military action effective. This conflict has no military solution, he said, adding that the operation of the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline will deter Azerbaijan from a military option, because the countries that have supported the pipeline will oppose such an option. Oskanian said the people of Karabagh naturally opted for independence, after years of being illegally attached to Azerbaijan by Stalin. He said Armenians never accepted that decision, and at the first opportunity, they declared independence through the laws of secession of the Soviet Union. The Azeris opted for violent suppression, which led to a war and Armenia's involvement to assist Karabagh. The evidence is clear that the only period that Karabagh has ever been part of Azerbaijan was during the Soviet Union. Indeed, Oskanian said that Azerbaijan's current constitution reflects the country as the successor to the Republic of Azerbaijan of 1918, which did not include Karabagh. On the problem of corruption in Armenia, Oskanian said, Of course, there is corruption in Armenia, but the scale of the corruption should not be exaggerated, noting that independent indexes have shown Armenia to be less corrupt than its neighbors of the former Soviet Union. He said salary increases that come from economic development will bring corruption down, and he said he dismissed speculation about President Kocharian's involvement in corruption. Regarding Armenian Genocide recognition, Oskanian said there have been successes in various countries and international organizations, but not with the government of Turkey, although he noted that recently there has been a change in Turkish society where more discussion about the issue is taking place. He said the process of Turkey's accession to the European Union could also help in this regard. Oskanian said there was also no progress with Turkey on the issue of its closed border with Armenia. Although the two sides met several times over the past few years, no progress was made. Because Turkey was using these meetings to falsely project an image to the European Union that progress was being made with Armenia, Armenia decided to discontinue the meetings, until such time that positive results could be guaranteed. On relations with Iran, Oskanian said, To their credit, Iranians have maintained a very balanced relationship regarding Armenia and Azerbaijan. He said even though Azeris are Shiite Muslim, as are the Iranians, and there are many Azeris living in Iran, They put their strategic interests ahead of religious interests. Turkey didn't do that. If Iran had adopted a policy like Turkey's, Armenia would have probably starved to death, cut off from the rest of the world. So, we appreciate Iran, he said, adding that Armenia's relationship with Iran does not affect its relationship with the U.S. Armenia is considerate of both their interests. In his meeting with the Bay Area Armenian National Committee, Oskanian commended and congratulated the committee on all the work it has been doing, advocating for issues important to the Armenian-American community in the political arena. Bay Area ANC members briefed the Foreign Minister on their activities - maintaining strong relationships with elected officials, participating in campaigns, educating the community on political initiatives relating to Armenia, establishing The Genocide Education Project to help educate public school students about the Armenian Genocide, etc. Calling the ANC and other advocacy groups extremely effective, having done a great job from the early days, in helping Armenia through its work relating to U.S. foreign assistance to Armenia, Turkey, and Azerbaijan, and Armenian Genocide recognition. Commenting on the concern raised during the meeting about the alarming rates of emigration from Armenia, Oskanian said the most troublesome issue was that many residents, despite having a good enough income to live relatively comfortably, choose to leave the country in hopes of a better future for their children. The UC Berkeley reception brought the Foreign Minister together with Prof. Stephan Astourian, Executive Director of the Armenian Studies Program at UCB, the UCB dean of the Division of Letters and Science, the dean of International Area Studies, and contributors to the William Saroyan endowment in Armenian Studies at UCB. All spoke enthusiastically of the effort to reach the endowment goals, which will provide for a full, lasting program of Armenian Studies at a premier U.S. university.

"During one of his telephone calls, Robert Fisk asked if I had seen his long piece in the Independent, and (having been alerted by a previous call) I replied that I had. He then noted that he had referred to the Armenian Genocide as the Armenian holocaust, and I replied that I had noticed. He then asked, and he would repeat it in every call: Why don't you start calling it a 'holocaust,' instead of a 'genocide'? I would reply that we Armenians are having a difficult time getting the world to accept the word Genocide - holocaust would take another lifetime. And then, he would respond: No, I mean you. (I do, in certain correspondence, but that's another matter.) Fisk's new book is out and, as he told me, It's not about the Armenians, but there is one good chapter on the Armenians. Indeed, there is one good chapter in The Great War for Civilization: The Conquest of the Middle East. It is not a historian's history. It is a top journalist's personal history of the Middle East. (The first part of the title, Fisk explains, is from the inscription on one of the medals awarded to his late father, during service in World War I.) This review, then, will be about Chapter Ten: The First Holocaust, a term that Fisk uses throughout the 49 pages of that good chapter. In that phone call, Fisk also indicated that he had had a long discussion with his editor about the fact that his newspaper had used the word holocaust with a lower-case h when the story he had submitted had used the capital letter H. He went into details about the newspaper's style and suchlike, and when he asked why the Jewish Genocide warranted a capital H, he was told that it was different. Needless to say, he won his case and all his references in all his stories now also bear the capital H, as it does throughout this chapter. He refers to that episode in the chapter. Fisk is Britain's most honored foreign correspondent, having won more awards than any other journalist - British International Journalist of the Year (seven times), Amnesty International UK Press Award (twice), European International Journalist of the Year, United Nations Press Award, Martha Gellhorn Award, Johns Hopkins SIAS-CIBA Prize for International Journalism, and the David Watt Award, for his essay on language and, specifically, the use of holocaust for what happened to the Jews of Europe and the use of genocide for what happened to the Armenians, Fisk's last 29 years have been in the Middle East, based in Beirut, first with the (London) Times and now with the Independent newspapers (daily and Sunday); He goes where few others go and, during the actual fighting, he is as close as it is possible to be - sometime unwisely close. During the Iraq wars, his life was in danger many times, but he got the story - which is his main objective. In the current Bush fiasco, he refused to be embedded, and reported actions that no other journalist reported, which earned him one of his many awards. But, this isn't about Fisk the journalist; this is about Fisk the author (and friend of the Armenians). And about that good chapter. It contains the Genocide (oops, Holocaust) story from the mouths of survivors and eyewitnesses as well as individuals who have made it a point to visit the Ottoman killing fields. And, it contains a map showing where the Armenians were gathered and the death-march routes and the ultimate death camps. And, he throws stones - does he ever! He is hard on the Turks for their denial, hard on the Americans for their denial, hard on the British for their denial, hard on the Israelis for their denial, hard on newspapers for their denial. Fisk does not like governments - neither the American nor his British, neither the Arabian nor the Israeli. It is not the anarchist's dislike but that of the seeker after truth. He once told me, I never talk with governments; I know what they are going to say - and it will be lies. He refers to these lies - those during World War I and those expressed yesterday. Readers, who have seen the film in which Fisk actually discovers bones of Armenians and then uncovers the cave where Armenians were burned alive, will now read about those incidents. We are with him as the atrocities that those bones represent are brought to life with the testimony of survivors and witnesses. We are with him as he interviews blind survivors in a home for the Armenian blind, in Lebanon, who still can see the events that they describe and he notes. Many of the stories that he repeats have appeared (in one form or other) in countless books and diaries and journals and memoirs by both survivors as well as non-Armenian eyewitnesses. Therefore, to any Armenian who has done any reading around in such publications, there is very little new. But, oh, what a shock is this chapter going to be to the system of the Turks and their apologists! As we get a capsule history of that period, we are brought face to face with the sheer obscenity of the Turkish denials and their let the historians decide mantra - as if the testimony of the survivors and the eyewitnesses isn't historical reality. As long as there is the testimony of the I was there. I suffered. I saw survivor, it is only the immoral politician who can join the Turkish denial. And, as Fisk has said, The journalist is writing the first draft of history, as an impartial witness. As he notes how yesterday is repeated today, Fisk says, It was as if history were a gigantic echo chamber. Citing some of the contemporaneous sources - among them Morgenthau, Bryce and Toynbee, Churchill, a British prisoner of the Turks, American consul Leslie Davis, compassionate Germans (who were Turkey's allies) - as well as the researches of historians and others, Fisk manages to capture in a few pages all the facts for any good argument. He cites Churchill as the first to use the term holocaust in his own monumental work, published in 1929: the massacres [of] uncounted thousands of helpless Armenians, men, women and children together, whole districts blotted out in one administrative holocaust beyond human redress. Hitler's quotes are there - including one from 1924 that is new to this reviewer - as well as the attempts by the Turks and their apologists to deny their validity. Here, as elsewhere, Fisk brings in those denials which make, the Turks and their apologists all the more ridiculous. And, with regard to the denials, Fisk includes reports of the language used by the Turks and their apologists at their targets. Especially interesting, however, is the language used to condemn Franz Werfel for his book, The Forty Days of Musa Dagh (in which he also uses the word holocaust): alleged Turkish horrors perpetrated against the Armenians and a condemnation of America's Armenian Jews for promoting in the U.S.A. the sale of Werfel's book. No, not the Turks, this time, but the Nazis! Some people keep interesting company. Fisk does recount history:- what befell the Armenians who returned to Cilicia after the war, what befell the fledgling Armenian republic, the Sevres and the Lausanne treaties, the fate of Alexandretta (which should be a lesson to the Greek Cypriots who think that they can outsmart the Turks, but it won't - but that's their problem) - and there is the recent past. This includes broken promises by American presidents, weasel-worded British denials, the Lowry/Ambassador letter to Robert Lifton, and, that famous statement by Shimon Peres that what happened to the Armenians was a tragedy but not a genocide. (My late brother asked rhetorically in one of his Newsletters if it could be said that what happened to the Jews was a genocide but not a tragedy.) Since much of the chapter contains what every Armenian knows - or should know - it is difficult to gauge the reaction of the non-Armenian who has not had the benefit (or the curse) of first-, second-, or third-hand introduction via family and friends, as well as the countless testimonies of survivors and eyewitnesses that should be on every Armenian's bookshelves. Obviously too late for some of the more recent events - the Turkish conference, the recent UCLA conference - where Turks who have differed with their country's official policy and who have been verbally attacked and abused, Fisk nonetheless recounts enough instances where attacks and abuse are the usual approach to anyone who dares to speak out to show that one should not be surprised that they continue. (Perhaps someone should compile a book on Turkish invectives as applied to the Armenian Holocaust. But, keep it away from your wives, your children, and your servants.) After finishing this chapter, I was surprised at how short it was considering how packed it was with fact and information. That is because he writes as the journalist - clean, concise, crisp language making every word count - and not with the luxury of the historian who can take his time presenting the facts in context and calling on sources old and new with whom he may not have contact. As evidence of his sources, however, there are three solid pages of names (from A to Z) to whom Fisk expresses his thanks. Some of these names appear in the text, others will realize that this is my specific thanks personally to them. But, as I say above, this book isn't only about the Armenians; it is about a journalist's experiences in the Middle East. And a word or two about that. Among the reports that should enlighten the reader are Fisk's three interviews with Osama bin Laden - about which he reported at the time and which should have had red lights flashing in the Foreign Offices of the world. If anyone feels that Fisk is too-Muslim, let him read carefully what he says about Yassar Arafat. While it may seem strange to recommend the purchase of a massive doorstop of a book (more than 1100 pages!) on the strength of one chapter, I don't hesitate in doing so, in this case. Read Chapter Ten first, then read the rest of the book. It won't be easy, but whoever said that life was easy? It should be noted that the book has already been translated into more than a dozen languages and very shortly the number will reach a round 20 - including Turkish. Chapter Ten will be in the Turkish version, so it will be interesting to see what will happen to the Turkish publisher. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.

"In pluralist societies today, inter-faith dialogue is not an option but a necessity. Interaction, interpenetration and interdependence are significant features and dominant realities of modern societies. Religions, as integral components of human societies, cannot remain aloof and indifferent. They are active parts of dialogical interaction occurring in all areas and at all levels of society's life. This statement was made by His Holiness Aram I at a press conference in Kuwait on Saturday, November 26, 2005. Speaking about the crucial importance of inter-faith dialogue, he said: Religion has an important place in public life; it is no more a private affair. Religion impacts the human life in all its aspects and manifestations and is, at the same time, impacted by almost all developments and changes taking place in societies. Therefore, religions must work together and meet the common needs of humanity and face common challenges together. Differences must be respected and accepted, and common values must be deepened. Religions have a common responsibility vis-à-vis humanity. They must assume their common calling and task together, said His Holiness Aram I. In response to a question concerning Christian-Muslim dialogue, Catholicos Aram I reminded, Christian-Muslim dialogue is not an academic exercise; it is not a mere theological intercourse. Christian-Muslim dialogue is an existential reality, it is a way of life. It is rooted in our common history. In the Middle East we don't speak about dialogue; we live it; it is an inseparable part of our life. I come from Lebanon where we don't speak about dialogue but about a shared life. In spite of our differences, we have never lost in Lebanon the sense of being part of a broader Lebanese community on the bases of common values and aspirations. In fact, Christian-Muslim dialogue as a way of life is one of the characteristic marks of the history of this region. This is not only a source of pride for us, but also a challenge and a reminder that we must deepen our collaboration in a world which is in dire need of peace with justice and reconciliation. The reaction of His Holiness Aram I concerning a question whether terrorism is identified with Islam was immediate and firm: No, this is not true and this way of looking at violence is unacceptable. Referring to violence, Aram I said: It is the most terrible evil of human life; we all are experiencing the destructive and deadly consequences of violence. I don't believe that any religion will endorse violence. All religions must join forces to combat violence. In this context, His Holiness mentioned that, in 2000, the World Council Churches initiated A Decade to Overcome Violence. In his concluding remarks, Catholicos Aram I maid an appeal to all religions and particularly to Islam and Christianity to deepen and enlarge the common ground to face together the new challenges of societies and work together for the promotion of moral, spiritual and human values. His Holiness Aram I is visiting the Armenian community in Kuwait. More than ten thousand Armenians live in Kuwait; they have a church, school and community organizations. The primate of the community is His Eminence Archbishop Gorun Babian. Armenians are very active, particularly in the economic life of Kuwait.

"DETROIT--We are deeply saddened and regret to announce that Michal Krolewski, the longtime President and heart and soul of American Polish Assistance Association, passed away on October 11, 2005. His sudden death left many of us who had a chance to know him personally in deep sorrow and disbelief. He will be always remembered in the hearts of the many people whose lives he touched. We will miss him and the world will miss him, the obituary at the APAA's website stated. It could not have said it better. I had known Michal since he was a student in his late teens in late 1960s Detroit and have associated him with things Polish ever since then. I have also worked with him of different projects including a campaign to brighten Christmas for Polish orphans. Although born in America, he preferred Michal (pronounced: MEE-how) to Michael or Mike, and rather than the Anglo-mangled crow-LOOSE-key, he pronounced his surname the proper way: kroo-LEFF-ski. He came from a Polish immigrant family, and his mother was a cook who catered to Polish weddings on Detroit's heavily Polish northeast side and the adjacent Polonian suburb of Hamtramck. Back in the 1960s, with a handful of like-minded young Polonians, Michal set up the Polish-American Folk Theatre which, despite its innocuous-sounding name, was an extremely dynamic and, at times, rebellious youth group. Far from being just another dance group or theatre circle, the PATF was more of a movement that attracted young, mainly American-born Pol-Ams in their teens and 20s. It included the Galicja Dancers and later Little Galicja for children. The group began issuing a newspaper called Pokoj (Polish for Peace) and traveling to Poland to gain a deeper appreciation of authentic Polish culture, costumes, customs and dance routines. At its peak, the movement spread from its base in southeastern Michigan to outposts in Pennsylvania and Ohio, infecting many young name-only Polish Americans with a newfound appreciation for their roots. PAFT members also revived many traditions that were fast disappearing in the Detroit area, including pisanki, wycinanki and other crafts as well as koledy concerts and Corpus Christi processions down the streets of the old Polish neighborhoods. And those vibrant dazzling folk-dance performances by young Pol-Ams, who really put their heart and soul into it, set a new benchmark for non-professional performing ensembles of their kind. Krolewski used to say that, unlike the drug-tripping hippies and Vietnam War protesters of the day, Our kids are getting high on their Polish heritage. But Krolewski and his faithful followers were also sensitive to the anti-Polish slurs that abounded during the heyday of the Polack joke. When the Detroit Free Press ran an insulting article entitled Survivors' report from a Polish wedding (about the alleged low-class, drunken rowdiness of such celebrations), the PAFT turned out in force and picketed the paper's offices in downtown Detroit. This was but one example of the group's ethnic assertiveness. Not all the second-generation parents of the PAFT's youthful members appreciated such involvement. Many of them wanted nothing better than to forget their Polish roots and become just plain Americans, and here their third-generation children were getting increasingly involved the heritage of their immigrant grandparents. But Krolewski's kids did not want to be rootless Americans, swept along from one commercial fad, trend or fashion to the other. Today the children of many of those teenagers and young adults are carrying on their parents' appreciation for their Polish ancestral legacy. Over the years, Krolewski's varied activites have included running a Polish import shop in the Detroit suburb of New Baltimore, setting up Polish language, folkcraft and dance courses and developing diverse charitable activities including the American-Polish Assistance Association (Komitet Polonia Polsce) which benefits orphans in Poland. Krolewski's group pioneered the Holy Thursday bus pilgrimages and tours of Detroit's old Polonian parishes. As International Students Director at Polonia's St. Mary's College (Orchard Lake, Mich.) in recent years, Krolewski was largely instrumental in boosting the school's enrollment to an all-time high by recruiting students from Poland and other Slavic countries. Books could be written about Krolewski's numerous contributions of Polonian self-awareness and self-appreciation, and hopefully some day they will. Yes, he was steeped through and through in traditional Polishness and Roman Catholicism, but stood out for his ecumenical approach to other religions and ethnic groups. After 9-11 he assisted non-Christian students from Albania, Bosnia and elsewhere who were feeling the painful sting of America's anti-Muslim backlash. And his parish tours raised eyebrows in some corners of Polonia, because they included visits to Polish National Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches, even Jewish synagogues and Muslim mosques. But that's the way Michal always was: a true Polish-American patriot devoid of any chauvinism or xenophobia. Wieczny odpoczynek racz Mu dac, Panie, a swiatlosc wiekuista niechaj Mu swieci na wieki.

"THANKSGIVING is the most worthy and enjoyable of American holidays. There are no religious overtones so every faith and creed can celebrate it, there are no baskets of presents to buy so everyone is equal. Above all, there is precious little of the hype and consumer madness that now characterizes Christmas. We know that right over the horizon, after the quiet celebration of Thanksgiving, comes the whirling dervish of Christmas. The simplicity of Thanksgiving is a welcome antidote to all that. It is indeed a simple day, one where we can all give thanks for everything we have been granted in the past year. In a country as rich and diverse as America there is obviously much to be thankful for. Doubtless, the Irish from the famine-tossed ships who came ashore during the Great Hunger gave thanks, as did the Fenians, fleeing their failed insurrection in the late 1860s, and the generations of Irish since who have come to call America home. In the 1920s the defeated IRA veterans of the Irish Civil War, the hard-pressed economic migrants of the 1950s and 1980s and today's emigrants all found save haven here. In our own day there are approximately 10,000 people a year immigrating legally from Ireland every year, and who knows how many illegally. They will find that America is an idea, rather than a country, one that binds together some of the most disparate people on earth and call them simply Americans. It is highly doubtful if a situation similar to what happened in France - with its disaffected Muslim minority who do not consider themselves French, even though they are born there - could occur here because of this. That is the genius of America. Almost without exception, the second generations, whether they are descended from Muslim, Catholic, Jewish, Protestant or atheist, consider themselves American first. Because it is a melting pot of so many cultures there is an inevitable coming together to celebrate the common heritage that future generations will share. No one, from whatever background, is excluded from that. But they also do not forget where they came from. Take any summer Sunday in New York and you will find a Greek, Turkish, Puerto Rican, German or some other nationality on parade, not to mention our own little contribution on March 17. It has been estimated that there are 130 different nationalities living in the five boroughs of New York. It is the power of the idea of America which is the glue that holds them all together. That is why Thanksgiving is so special for immigrants and their American born family members. It is a chance to see this country from different perspectives. For the immigrant it is the day they give thanks for making it safely to what is the most successful, diverse and richest country on earth. For the American-born it is an opportunity to reflect on the blessings they receive because they live in America. There are many flaws, of course - the rich get richer here, and the present administration seems intent on expanding rather than narrowing the poverty gap. There is no universal health care like in so many other countries, some minorities are still targets of discrimination, and there is a war to deal with, not to mention the fear of another terrorist episode. But there are always naysayers who believe the sky is falling. The power of the idea of America, as laid out in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights is one of the most irresistible forces on earth. The proof is that if the doors were flung open tomorrow billions would likely want to come. Let us be thankful we, or our forefathers and mothers did. Happy Thanksgiving.

"After Growing Up as a Muslim Turk in Turkey, a Young Turkish Woman Discovers That She's Really Armenian My name is Filiz. My name is different from those of my ancestors, because I've grown up in Muslim Turkey speaking Turkish. I am the granddaughter of one, who never told his story to anyone, nor did his mother. My grandfather was 5 years old in 1915. His mother Gulunya got married to a Turkish man after she lost her husband Melkon in that year. She then changed her name and religion. As a result, my grandfather's name and religion became changed accordingly. Nobody but they ever knew what their life had been like. My grandfather had 5 children. They did not know that their father was originally Armenian either. The children got married and had children. Those children did not know their grandfather's past either. My grandfather died in 1983. When he died, his children saw unknown names in some documents. I was 18 by that time. Crying, my mother told me, Now I find out that actually we were Armenians. I was having difficulty understanding why she was crying. My grandfather's being Armenian, whose place in my life is very special and can never be filled, was making me so excited. However, at that point, the level of my knowledge of history was not sufficient to understand the connection of those documents with my grandfather. Despite all my efforts, I couldn't obtain any information. The children did not even know the name of their father at his birth. Also, no one was willing to speak up on this subject; they wanted to cover it up. I kept this information inside me, believing I would not be able to find out anything further. Then time went by and, in April 2005, I had some dreams. In one of them, my grandfather was pointing out a chapel and a tree next to it. The tree did not have branches and roots like an ordinary tree; rather, it was a kind of thornless bush bearing fruit resembling raspberries. My grandfather was saying, I left those behind me, what else have I left? After those dreams, I happened to think that my grandfather was asking for something from me. Also, by then, I was grown up; I was already a mature woman, knowing lots of people, working in the publishing field. That is to say, I had the environment to make the necessary connections. Since April, I started searching. First, I took notes not to forget the results of my search, because this period of time was really very chaotic for me. Besides, I was witnessing lots of talk starting with ...actually my grandfather too, my grandmother too... in this period. Hrant Dink, the managing editor of the bilingual (Turkish/Armenian) weekly newspaper Agos published in Istanbul, was a classmate of mine in college. With every step I took, every scrap of knowledge I found, I was calling him. He was impressed by my excitement. He said, Filiz, even if you don't find out anything, just writing about your search is enough. All that you find out is far more important. It was as if I was praying for my ancestors without knowing who they were or what their names were, what their faces looked like, or what language they had spoken. I started to write the story of this search, step by step. Eventually, I learned that my grandfather's mother was the daughter of Nakkashians and his father was the son of Mardinians/Merdinians, both of Kayseri. One day, I hope to find some relatives and uncover lost traces and lost stories of my own family. I cannot even guess how many people there are living in Turkey, who are in my very same situation. For this reason, I must tell what I lived. Because this is my debt of conscience in the name of my lost loved ones. I am standing right in the middle of a broken bridge. Running through me simultaneously is the blood of those who had committed torture, as well as the blood of those who had been tortured. This realization gives rise to a feeling that is not easy to understand or explain...

"On Sunday afternoon, November 6, 2005, an extraordinary forum titled Three Turkish Voices on the Ottoman Armenians took place at UCLA. Organized by Professor Richard Hovannisian and sponsored by the UCLA Armenian Educational Foundation Chair in Modern Armenian History with the support of the Center for Near Eastern Studies, the program included Dr. Taner Akçam, University of Minnesota; Dr. Elif Shafak, University of Arizona; and Dr. Fatma Muge Goçek, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. Featuring an exclusively Turkish panel, the forum generated great interest among students, academics, and the public. More than 800 people arrived at an auditorium that has a normal capacity of 375 but was crammed with 500 more than eager attendees who spilled over into the aisles, vestibules, and all available floor space. Fortunately, an adjacent auditorium was soon opened to accommodate most of the remaining overflow crowd, which was. able to listen through a live audio link and to meet and hear the participants directly after each had spoken in the first auditorium. Dr. Hovannisian noted that this was not only a record-breaking event but also a historic occasion, as three scholars had come to challenge the Turkish state's narrative of denial by openly addressing the fate of the Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire. He stated: I am most grateful to Professors Akçam, Shafak, and Goçek, who understand that the topic at hand is not only one that is an Armenian issue but one that is equally a Turkish and a humanitarian issue. Dr. Akçam discussed the value of the Ottoman archives for studying the Armenian Genocide. He insisted that the belief that nearly all Ottoman documents concerning the Genocide were destroyed by successive Turkish governments is a misconception. Although no proverbial smoking gun has been discovered to prove conclusively that the Young Turk government planned and executed the physical destruction of the Armenian people, there is extensive documentation relating to the genocidal intent of the regime. Such documents include official papers and correspondences from the central authorities in Istanbul guiding and instructing regional party and administrative officials in the implementation of the mass deportation of the Armenians, the appropriation and distribution of Armenian property and assets, the special targeting and intentional maltreatment of the Armenian deportees, and the swift settlement of Muslim newcomers in the Armenian towns and villages, often within a few days after the Armenians were marched away. Such evidence demonstrates that the Genocide was carefully planned and carried out by the central government, which purposefully denied the deportees the protection and care necessary for their survival. Dr. Shafak expressed the need to look into the personal histories or micro-histories of people whose lives were changed and destroyed by the calamity. With the passing of time and the gradual disappearance of victims of and witnesses to the massacres, Turks and Armenians tend respectively to view each other as one monolithic accuser or as a homogenous group of perpetrators. Focusing on the lives of individuals immediately affected by the brutality, however, puts a personal face on the victims. Shafak presented the example of Zabel Yessayan, an Armenian author from Constantinople, whose early works expressed her belief that Turks and Armenians were able to live together as citizens of their common homeland - the Ottoman Empire. As relations between the two groups deteriorated into massive elimination, however, Yessayan was stripped of her optimism. Her post-genocide writing reflects the complete shattering of her vision of a symbiotic relationship and a free multinational existence. Dr. Shafak explained: In focusing on Zabel Yessayan, I not only wanted to put a personal face to the collective pain inflicted on the Armenian people in 1915 but also to show that the Young Turks saw the Armenian intellectuals as a danger, and this was the reason that they suppressed and silenced them first. Just as important, my question is, why and how have Turkish and Armenian intellectuals failed to collaborate in the past and how can they overcome this sad legacy to work together toward reconciliation? Dr. Goçek discussed the conference on Ottoman Armenians that took place in Istanbul in September. The programs of that conference, which she distributed, showed the wide range of topics addressed by the participants, all of whom were, as the organizers intended, Turkish citizens. She illustrated the difficulties faced by organizers and participants. Certain government circles attempted to prevent the convening of the conference, which had to be postponed from its originally scheduled date in May to September, after an international storm of protest gave great visibility to the event. Even in September, legal challenges were made to prevent the opening of the conference, but fortunately the organizers used loopholes to circumvent the courts. The conference received thorough, mostly negative, coverage in the Turkish media. The tacit support of certain individuals in the Turkish government and the positive reactions by some members of the Turkish press, however, show that at least some influential persons seem to be taking a positive stance toward the liberalization of Turkish society and the freedom of expression. The organizers and almost all participants in the September conference came away with deep emotional satisfaction and hope. After each speaker, the audience submitted written questions and, at the end of the forum, the speakers again addressed specific points that had been raised. All Three Turkish Voices received sustained applause from a riveted, highly appreciative audience. Encouraged by the unprecedented turnout and active discussion session, Dr. Richard Hovannisian suggested that further conferences and lectures may be in order to explore further and develop the themes and issues considered during the forum.

"It's tempting to look around the globe and think we live in an age of extreme religious conflict. Many have described the war in Iraq - and the war on terror in general - as a clash of civilizations, and religion is a central aspect of the civilizations which are clashing. Meanwhile, enraged Muslim immigrants are torching the suburbs of Paris and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to roil. But a new book shows us that religion has always been a violent topic, even in the U.S. More specifically, the Irish in New York City were thought to be particularly violent, as author and historian Jill Lepore shows in her new book New York Burning: Liberty, Slavery and Conspiracy in Eighteenth Century Manhattan (Alfred A. Knopf). The book reminds us that New York's first waves of Irish were not looked upon as merely foreign but as destructive rabble-rousers and traitors. Then again, Lepore's new book, which explores a supposed conspiracy between Irish Catholic and rebellious African slaves, is just one recent item which illustrates the enduring passions of religion. After all, what has been on the History Channel all week? A new documentary about the Crusades, exploring the wars of Christian and Muslim domination which were waged nearly 10 centuries ago. Meanwhile, what anniversary did England celebrate (if that's the right word) earlier this week, but the 400th anniversary of Guy Fawkes Day. Americans are not very familiar with Guy Fawkes Day, which is a kind of July 4th with anti-Catholic undertones. As one website describes it, November 5 is known as 'Bonfire Night' or 'Guy Fawkes Night,' and all over Britain people fire off fireworks, light bonfires, and burn effigies of Guy Fawkes. Fawkes was an Englishman who ... tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament with barrels of gunpowder. He was caught, imprisoned, tortured on the rack, and finally executed. Fawkes, of course, was the leader of a conspiracy known as the Gunpowder Plot. He and his Catholic co-conspirators attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament and kill the Protestant King James I after the king allegedly failed to stem the persecution of Catholics. Naturally, the English Protestants and Irish Catholics who came to the U.S. imported their intense tensions. In Manhattan in 1741, with the inflammatory addition of racism and slavery, such conflicts erupted in a spasm of paranoia and death. As Lepore describes it in her book, the Protestant middle class in New York City was always tense about African slave rebellion. When rumors spread that Irish Catholics and African slaves were aiming to topple the establishment, it seemed like a nightmare to city leaders. Then came a series of destructive fires which city leaders knew, just knew, were started by traitors - Irish Catholics and blacks - in their midst. After the arson charges, Irish-born soldier William Kane was said to be a leader in the Irish-African arson conspiracy. Under questionable circumstances, Kane confessed and then named names. Kane and most of the men he named were Irish...and formed the overwhelming number of the city's poor, many of them recent arrivals. Soldiers like Kane...had probably been driven into the British Army by the Irish famine of 1740-41, the bliadhain an air (year of the slaughter), writes Lepore. That Kane named poor Irishmen to the conspiracy was new, and especially gratifying to (Protestant) prosecutors. They made much of the Gaelic origins of their suspects, noting that several of the damaging fires took place on or right after St. Patrick's Day. The belief that Irish Roman Catholics were teaming up with slaves to destroy New York's social structure led many to call the conspiracy a priest's plot. Such a label could literally be a death sentence since, as Lepore notes, to be a Roman Catholic priest was illegal in New York in 1741, a crime punishable by death. In a scene right out of the Salem With Trials, numerous people were ultimately hanged - Irish Catholic, black and Protestant as well - while others confessed to various questionable crimes to save their own necks. Tonight, Paris is burning. Sadly, Lepore's new book and the so-called Irish priest's plot reminds us that religion has been exploited as a force of division for centuries.

"In an August 31 editorial titled More Anti-Semitism, the Kyiv Post wrote: August 28 marked another sad day for Ukraine. That's when latent, often ignored and frequently tolerated anti-Semitism in Ukraine appeared to have shown its repugnant face. A local Jewish student was beaten and left for dead in the center of the city. In an October 10 news story titled Ukrainian Jews Honor Victims of Babi [sic] Yar Massacre, the Kyiv Post recounted the horrors of that Nazi-directed carnage which killed 33,700 Jews, and then, in a kind of gratuitous, oh, by the way statement, the editorial concluded: Hundreds of thousands [of Jews] have been killed in pogroms [in Ukraine] over the centuries, and millions died in the Holocaust. Babyn Yar was a horrendous atrocity during which Nazis killed thousands of Ukrainian Jews. But Ukrainians also were murdered at Babyn Yar. They were not mentioned in the Kyiv Post story. Why not? Like the Holocaust itself, it appears that Babyn Yar has now become an exclusively Jewish calamity. Questions abound. Why is it that whenever Kyiv Post writers mention anti-Semitism in Ukraine they feel compelled to mention pogroms that occured in Ukraine centuries ago, never mentioning the fact that they were orchestrated by Russian tsarist authorites and the Black Hundreds? If Ukraine is so anti-Semitic, why are thousands of Jews returning to Ukraine from Israel? Why is there never any mention of the 1,755 people of Ukraine who rescued Jews during World War II, Christians like Tanka Kontsevych, mentioned in Martin Gilbert's book The Righteous: Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust. Why does the Kyiv Post ignore Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky, responsible for the survival of hundreds of Jews? While thousands of Jews are returning to anti-Semitic Ukraine, Jews are fleeing France in droves. Small wonder. According to the French Interior Ministry, there were 510 anti-Jewish acts or threats in the first six months of 2004. More still in 2005. Claiming that France was host to the wildest anti-Semitism, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon recently urged more of France's Jews to emigrate to Israel. Do any of these news stories mention France's complicity in the Holocaust? Of course not. And yet, the Vichy French government, a collaborationist regime headed by Henri Petain, helped in the deportation of 70,000 Jews. They also directly assisted the Nazis, in taking Jewish private property, destroying synagogues, and other Jewish monuments, and in shipping Jews to Nazi death camps. Donna F. Ryan confirms these numbers in her 1996 book The Holocaust and the Jews of Marseille. Is the Vichy government ever mentioned in news stories about anti-Semitism in France today? No. Instead we get a kind of sanitized version of the present depravity, suggesting that France's growing Muslim population is responsible. If the Kyiv Post was truly balanced in its approach to Ukrainian Jewish relations, it would investigate the administration of the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Israel for its continuing refusal to award the title of Righteous to Metropolitan Sheptytsky for his role in saving hundreds of Jewish lives in Ukraine and, at great risk to his own life, openly condemning the killing of Jews from the pulpit. Yakov Suslensky, an Israeli citizen, whose life was saved by Ukrainians during Soviet times, has appealed to Israeli courts 18 times to rectify this injustice, all to no avail. He has also appealed to three Ukrainian presidents - Leonid Kravchuk, Leonid Kuchma and Viktor Yushchenko - to appeal to Israel directly, also to no avail. I know Yakov Suslensky; I helped coordinate two of his visits to the United States where he spoke to Ukrainian American audiences but was totally rebuffed by the Jewish American power structure. Another Jew, Kurt I. Lewin, son of the Chief Rabbi of Lviv, saved from certain death by Metropolitan Sheptytsky, has also taken up the cause, not only among Jews but with the Vatican as well. During the Nazi occupation of Ukraine, Mr. Lewin was hidden by Studite monks headed by Ihumen Clement, Sheptytsky's brother, where he became fluent in Ukrainian and totally at home with the Ukrainian liturgy. He even learned to sing the liturgical responses. Describing his Ukrainian Studite friends in his 1994 book A Journey Through IIlusions, Mr. Lewin wrote: They accepted every task entrusted to them by Metropolitan Andrew [Andrey], including sheltering Jews at the risk of their lives. They did it voluntarily, for the love of Christ, without expecting thanks or a reward. Like most Ukrainians, they were not particularly friendly toward Jews, or interested in them. Neverthless, a large number of Jews (over 200 of them) were saved in extraordinary circumstances, considering the size of the order. When the war ended, Mr. Lewin emigrated first to Israel, where he served in the military, and later to the United States, where he also tried to get fellow Jews interested in the metropolitan. In his book he writes: It was only after my arrival in the United States in 1951 that I could again explore the possibilities of interesting Jewish organizations in this extraordinary saga of assistance [the work of Metropolitan Sheptytsky]. I contacted the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, and others. I found no response whatsover. Later, Mr. Lewin, who named his son Andrew in honor of the metropolitan, testified in Rome on behalf of Metropolitan Sheptytsky's beatification on numerous occasions, beginning in 1959. His chapter titled The Story of a Saint is the best overview of the political resistance which the Sheptytsky postulation process has faced over the years, even among Ukrainian clergy. In favor of beatification was Cardinal Eugene Tisserant, prefect of the Congregation of Eastern Churches. Opposed was Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski of Poland who argued at the time that Metropolitan Sheptytsky was a controversial figure, much too involved in politics during his lifetime. It's sad that the Kyiv Post chooses to simplistically beat the pogrom drum every time some deranged cretin beats a Jew in Ukraine. Understanding Ukrainian-Jewish relations requires a far more nuanced approach. Myron Kuropas's e-mail address is: kuropas@comcast.net.

"IRISH journalist Rory Carroll, who was last week kidnapped but later freed by his kidnappers in Iraq; is celebrating his release in Dublin. Carroll, the son of the former Washington correspondent of The Irish Times Joe Carroll, flew home to Dublin on Saturday after his two-day ordeal in Baghdad. The journalist, who works for The Guardian newspaper in the U.K., told reporters that he feared he would suffer the same fate as other western hostages when he was kidnapped in Baghdad. He was captured by armed gunmen in the Shia Muslim slums of Baghdad's Sadr City last Wednesday and freed on Thursday night after 36 hours in captivity. Carroll, 33, said he felt very, very fortunate at being released. To be kidnapped in Baghdad as a westerner is not good news. We know the outcome of other hostages taken before. So not only to be released alive, but to be released so swiftly is extraordinary. I feel very, very fortunate, he said. Carroll thanked the Irish, British, and Iraqi governments, all of whom did wonders for him. It is believed that Carroll may have been kidnapped by Shia militia trying to secure the release of members being held by the British Army in Basra. The Baghdad correspondent said that he had repeatedly told his kidnappers that he was Irish and not British. He said he used references to the IRA, U2, and even drew a map of Western Europe to pinpoint his home country. But the significance didn't seem to register with the men holding him, he said. At the end I was down to Enya, Fair City, so at that point I gave up, he laughed. He told reporters that he feared he would meet the same fate as murdered Irish aid worker Margaret Hassan. Lying there in the dark...I was bracing myself that at some point I would hear a car coming into the house. I knew I would be able to hear it across the gravel, and that there would be a bunch of guys with guns and that I would be put into their custody and be taken, with a hood over my head, to an uncertain destination and to an uncertain fate, he said. I assumed that was going to happen at some point. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Rory Carroll)","Carey, Mairead",Irish Voice,2005-10-26,1
"Says Citizens Don't Have Right to Practice Faith Freely A recent report by the United States Mission to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) criticized Turkey for exerting excessive state control over minority religions, saying the Muslim country risks eroding the centuries-old Ecumenical Patriarchate of Istanbul, as well as the historic Syriac and Armenian Orthodox churches. The report, which was delivered to the OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting in Warsaw on September 28, also called on Turkey to clarify the legal status of 55 Protestant Churches that have been unable to register in Turkey and are vulnerable to closure and harassment. We regret that [Turkish] authorities continue to inhibit the opening of places of worship outside the Sunni Muslim mainstream and systematically disregard the OSCE's 1990 Bonn Document by expropriating the properties of religious groups without compensation, the U.S. statement said. Concurrently, the European Court of Human Rights is weighing a decision on the property rights of two minority foundations in Turkey. The Soorp Purgich Armenian Hospital Foundation and the Fener Greek Boys High School Foundation filed cases against Turkey, arguing that they are in compliance with the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne. The 1923 Treaty affords protection to foundations that provide public services for religious minorities. In both cases, properties gifted to the Armenian and Greek foundations were seized as the Turkish courts upheld orders declaring that the bequest violated a decree disallowing non-Muslims from donating real estate. If the court rules in favor of the foundations, hundreds of buildings seized in the past may be returned. The Armenian Assembly commends the OSCE for continuing to closely monitor religious freedom and minority rights in Turkey, said Assembly Board of Directors Chairman Anthony Barsamian. Rather than thwart freedom, Turkey must conform to EU standards where individual freedoms are protected and respected.

"An ecumenical meeting was held in the Prelacy of Canada on September 26, 2005 on occasion of His Holiness' visit to Montreal. Prelate Archbishop Khajag Hagopian, Archbishop Souren Kataroyan, Archbishop Moushegh Mardirossian (Prelate of the Western Prelacy) and religious officials attended the event. Primates and representatives of all the sister Christian churches in Montreal were also present. These included representatives from the Coptic Orthodox, Syrian Orthodox, representatives of the two Greek Orthodox families, the representative of Roman Catholic Cardinal Turcotte, Greek Catholic, Chaldean, Presbyterian, Anglican, Methodist, the representatives of the Armenian Catholic and Armenian Protestant churches, as well as the general and regional managers of Bible Society in Canada, the head of the ecumenical center of Montreal, and community officials. Prelate Archbishop Hagopian welcomed the attendants, expressing satisfaction that representatives from sister churches had accepted his invitation to greet His Holiness in Canada. The attendants received a new publication of the Bible and the Psalms in one edition by the diocese of Canada and the Bible Society. Reverend Manuel Djinbashian, who contributed immensely to the translations, carried out by the Catholicosate of Cilicia and with the cooperation of Archbishop Oshagan Choloyan (Prelate of the Eastern Prelacy) and late Archbishop Zareh Aznavorian, spoke about these translation works briefly and informed the attendants of the unique linguistic characteristics of the Armenian Bible. The regional director of the Bible Society, George Lugo, presented the edition, thanking Rev. Djinbashian, Serj Reyom (director of publications and circulation of Bible Society), Rev. Mark Henry Vidal (director of the Bible Society) and Rev. Karnig Koyounian, who had initiated the joint project. Lugo thanked also Prelate Hagopian, who had sponsored the mentioned project. His Holiness Aram I welcomed the spiritual leaders of Montreal in the city's Armenian Prelacy and praised their brotherly relations with the Prelate and the lay council. His Holiness spoke about the dominating presence of God's word in the Church. In the holy work of translating the Bible, we use the word 'Armenianize' in our language. As our fathers so carefully 'armenianized' the Bible, God spoke to our people in Armenian, said His Holiness. His Holiness pointed out that interpreting the spirit of the Bible is more important that its literal translation. He announced that he has formed a new committee of the members of the Cilician Brotherhood to continue the translation of the Old Testament: The event continued with warm discussions between the attendants. His Holiness answered several questions related to ecumenical issues, the theological thoughts and relations of different churches. The guests highlighted the role His Holiness plays in the ecumenical arena and his contribution to inter-religious initiatives. His Holiness spoke about the aims behind conferences and meetings organized by the World Council of Churches and other similar organizations. The Catholicos emphasized that such initiatives, particularly in the Christian-Muslim dialogue field, would contribute to boosting the role of religions in human societies and peaceful coexistence between the world's various communities.

"Turkey has begun membership talks with the EU after a diplomatic crisis was averted. Abdullah Gul, Turkey's foreign minister, arrived in Luxembourg for the opening ceremony on the night of October 3 and was greeted by British foreign secretary Jack Straw, who described the event as a truly historic day for Europe and the whole of the international community. Mr. Gul agreed, saying that a historic point has been reached and confirming that Turkey had been offered full membership. The text sets out very clearly the prospect of full membership. There is no alternative option [mentioned], he said. Earlier in the day it seemed that Austria would scupper the talks by demanding that Turkey should be offered only associative membership of the EU. But the demand was withdrawn, and some commentators are suggesting that Austria was mollified by an agreement to begin membership talks for Croatia. Many in Austria and other European countries have concerns about Turkey's prospective membership of the EU, and point to the country's poor recent record on democratic principles such as freedom of speech. Two weeks ago, the Turkish judiciary banned a conference scheduled to discuss the Armenian massacres of 1915, which the authorities refuse to acknowledge was an act of genocide by the Ottoman Empire. But the secular Muslim state will have to wait more than a decade before finally gaining accession status and Mr. Straw and others have urged Turkey to make progress with its democratic reforms.

"Rugged and landlocked, the former Soviet republic of Armenia has some three million inhabitants and occupies some 312,200 sq. miles (502,330 sq. km) of territory. Its declaration of independence from the USSR on September 21, 1991, brought challenges to the sovereignty of Armenia's Nagorno Karabagh province, a mountainous area of some 81 sq. miles (130 sq. km) inside neighboring Azerbaijan, mostly inhabited by Christian Armenians and surrounded by Muslim Azeris. During the fighting over Nagorno Karabagh between 1991 and 1994, both the Armenians and the Azeris used USSR aircraft still based in their territories. Azerbaijan had some important air bases: Gandzha and Sital Tchay were home of MiG-21s, MiG-25s, Su-22s and Su-24s, while at Sanchagaly, some 70 L-39s were armed with unguided rockets. Armenia had helicopters as well as aircraft from the DOSAAF (Russian civilian training) air bases. As a result, this particular air war was fought between a well-equipped Azerbaijan Air Force and a small Armenian Air Force. Although the latter comprised mainly helicopters, it also operated a good number of anti-aircraft weapons such as SA-7 MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defense Systems), 9K32 Strela and Zsu 23-2, plus - during the last phases of the conflict - some of the more sophisticated SA-14s. The fight for the Lachin Corridor, linking Armenia and Nagorno Karabagh, led to the loss of almost 30 Azerbaijani aircraft to MANPADS and other anti-aircraft ground fire: Armenia lost ten helicopters and two fast jets. When the fighting ended, the Armenian Air Force had some 13 Mi-24 Hind helicopters left, plus seven Mi-8/17s and five Su-25Ks. The Armenian Air Force was officially established in October 1992, though it suffered for many years from lack of funds, acquiring no further aircraft or helicopters. Last year it took delivery of Su-25Ks from the Slovak 3rd Flight at Malacky air base, including aircraft 5036, 6017, 8073, 8074, 8075, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1027 and the Su-25UKB 3237; two L-39s were acquired recently from Ukraine. Armenia's Minister of Defense, Dr. Serge Sargsyan, invited the authors to visit all the Armenian Air Force bases. At Yerevan we met Col. Daniel Balayan, commander of the Military Aviation Institute, created in 1993 to train pilots and technical personnel for careers in the air force and in civil aviation. The college has been completely rebuilt, and now has comfortable air-conditioned classrooms. Currently, 80 cadets from the technical branch are studying there, and a new pilot course is due to start soon. A pilot can only attend the institute by being officially accepted - 100 students are selected from 700-800 candidates. The course includes flying the Yak-52 for 80 hours and the L-39 for 60 hours. The first period of training is carried out at Arzni air base, some 18 miles (30km) northeast of Yerevan. A former DOSAAF base, it now flies aircraft and helicopters of the former Russian Air Force. At the moment the composite air wing has no numerical definition, although one is expected to be created in the near future. The Arzni airfield is not used for training as, at present, there are no courses there for pilots. However, ten Yak-52s are kept in perfect condition, alongside one Yak-55 for acrobatic training and a four-seater Yak-18T for liaison work. Three An-2s are still used for paratroop dropping, and a half-dozen Mi-2s are available for training, though only two or three are kept in flyable condition. At Yust, in the Yerevan area, stands Erebuni air base, still a Russian base where some dozen Red Star MiG-29s stand ready for air defense of the capital, Yerevan. There are still over 5,000 Russian military in Armenia as a consequence of a treaty between the two nations. Erebuni is a helicopter station housing the former Soviet 7th GvVP and its Mi-24P/K, Mi-17 and Mi-8MTK. The area is very beautiful - the landscape is dominated by the snow-capped Mount Ararat. The Armenian Air Force's most important base is at Gyumri, a town 80 miles (130km) north of Yerevan, destroyed by a terrible earthquake in 1988, which claimed thousands of lives. The airbase has a 10,450 ft (3,185m) runway and is the home of a former Russian Air Force Regiment, which flies Su-25Ks and Su-25UTKs, and houses some L-39s. Commander-in-chief of the Armenian Air Force is Colonel Stepan Galstyan (42) who met us at Gyumri. A former MiG-23 fighter pilot based in the north of the Soviet Union at the time of its collapse, he returned to his native country and became the first Armenian Su-25 pilot. Unusually, the recently acquired Slovak Su-25Ks have retained the color scheme and the national insignia of the Slovak Air Force.

"The spiritual leader of the largest non-Muslim minority community in Turkey, His Beatitude Mesrob II, Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and All Turkey, wrote a letter on September 30, 2005 to the German political leaders Gerhard Schroeder and Angela Merkel in support of Turkey's bid to join the European Union. The letter was sent just before the foreign ministers of the 25 EU nations held emergency talks last weekend aimed at overcoming objections to starting entry talks with Turkey. Patriarch Mesrob II also wrote to 732 EU parliamentarians and the ministers of the EU nations. The Armenian, Jewish, Syriac, Levantine, Greek, Chaldean and Protestant communities have displayed a strong desire for Turkey's becoming an EU member. The Patriarch's letter has the following content: As the Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and All Turkey, and as a citizen of the Republic of Turkey, I begin my letter by expressing the wish that your work may bring peace, happiness, and all good things to all of the citizens of your country. At this important juncture in human history, you are one of those political leaders who will play a major role in not only your country's future but also that of the European Union and hence of the world. In this regard you are indeed shouldering an important task in a 'project of civilization and peace,' the likes of which has not been seen in European Union or world history. The success of this project depends, to a large degree, on your decisions and leadership. In these days, when we hear talk of a 'clash of civilizations' between West and East, between the Christian world and the Muslim world, and when we see how terrorism has greatly damaged peace between civilizations, the basic aim of the European Union to try to cultivate the 'reconciliation of civilizations' and a multi-cultural society is something that especially we Eastern Christians passionately desire and nurture with great hope. We Eastern Christians bear the full witness of this effort, for we have been living in the Muslim world for centuries. The depth of the resulting experience constitutes a significant opportunity for Western Christians, who have newly begun to live together with Muslims and to experience this multicultural lifestyle. What we have undergone has provided a fund of wisdom that can provide clues as to what should be done and what should be avoided. These experiences tell us that the entry of Turkey, which is largely Muslim in population, into the European Union is vital from the standpoint of world peace. The aspiration of Turkey to join the European Union is an opportunity not only for Turkey and the European Union but also for world peace that must not be lost. We are aware that Turkey will have to pass difficult tests as part of the entry process. But it is clear that for world peace, these tests are necessary and unavoidable. We think that in this trial you, as a Western peacemaker, must help us. Pressure in recent days from various circles to postpone Turkey's membership process cause us concern. We perceive such affairs as being far from helpful. In the European Union harmonization process Turkey has expended great effort to implement the union criteria and has in a positive sense been steered toward real change on the democratic road. However, because of oppositionist and suspicious attitudes directed toward Turkey, it seems as though it is being forced to take backward steps and turn in on itself. Such undesired developments will be a blow not only to Turkey and Europe but also to reconciliation between West and East. It is now our supreme hope that the European debates on Turkey will shortly end with positive results, and that the attitude opposing Turkey will soon enter a more rational phase. We pray for the success of the European Union's civilization and peace project and that our country, Turkey, and that the Armenian Christians, who constitute the largest non-Muslim religious community in Turkey whom I represent, may take their place within it. 'Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called children of God!' declared the Lord Jesus Christ, and we are all living at a period in time when we could all perhaps make an extra effort to do as Christ says, for a better future and for a more livable world. With my deep respect and best wishes for your success, Yours prayerfully. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2005-10-08,1
"FOREIGN Minister, Dermot Ahern has welcomed the deal reached in Luxembourg this week which will see the start of negotiations with Turkey to allow the predominantly Muslim country to join the European Union. The negotiations, which will take at least 10 years to conclude, could see Turkey with its population of 70 million people becoming the largest state in the EU. But there has been widespread skepticism about the move, and it was only after 30 hours of intense negotiations that foreign ministers finally overcome objections to start the negotiation process. Ahern said he welcomed the deal to start talks with Turkey. Turkey is a bridge between the Middle East and Europe, he said. This will send a strong signal to Islam and moderate countries and people (that) the EU is not just a Christian club. Although there has been little debate about Turkish accession to the EU in Ireland, Ahern said he was confident that it would receive the support of the Irish, saying there would be at least 10 years to educate people. There is widespread opposition to the move across Europe. A recent opinion poll found that 80% of Austrians do not want Turkey to join, with just 10% in favor. Several other EU member states such as France, the Netherlands and Denmark are also concerned about allowing Turkey to join the EU. Meanwhile, EU foreign ministers have also signaled that they are ready to begin accession talks with Croatia which is likely to join the EU well before Turkey. Ireland has been a strong supporter of Croatia's bid to join the EU. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Dermot Ahern)","Carey, Mairead",Irish Voice,2005-10-05,1
"Europe has given the world the Roman Republic, Christianity, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, the Reformation and the French Revolution. These monumental historical movements have followed ebb tides of human history. Today's Europe is accused by many to be culturally moribund. But those who hear a death rattle or see the Grim Reaper had better hold on. The next redemption movement might just be the Rimini Meeting. If you have not heard about this remarkable event, it is probably because the anxious media vultures circling Europe have successfully kept it a secret. For the past twenty-five years, eight-hundred-thousand-plus concerned Europeans have come together in the Italian resort town of Rimini to discuss the diagnosis and treatment of an overindulged Europe that they see as seriously ill but not dead. It is fitting that the meeting place and the majority of the participants are Italian since it is this talented peninsula where the cultural European fetus implanted three millennia ago. The twelve million dollar annual tab to host the Rimini Meeting is picked up mostly by the Compagnia Delle Opere, the CDO. This is a Lombardian provincial coalition of thirty thousand Italian businesses. It is a remarkable example of the George Bush wish, compassionate capitalism. In spite of vitality, the press coverage is at times indifferent, even negative. They use distracting catch words like, conservative, right wing, fundamentalist. They even sound the usual death knell, Christian. The meeting is familiar with this marginalizing tactic, so its pious answer to the media, is, 'Not so fast, Brothers. The world must seriously consider the complicated energy that has attracted the Dalai Lama, The Pope, Mother Teresa, Ground Zero architect Daniel Liebskind, Lech Walesa, Santo Versace, Tenor Jose Carreras, BoutrosBoutros Gali, Romano Prodi, Giulio Andreotti, Jose Maria Aznar, German, French, British, American intellectuals, rabbis, mullahs, priests and the Iraqi and Afghani Foreign Ministers, H. Al Zebari and A. Abdullah. Throughout history individuals have changed the lives of millions and redirected history, Jesus Christ, Martin Luther, Henry VIII, Mohammed and Karl Marx, to name a few. This movement has had such a leader, Father Giusanni. This Italian prelate's message was simple. World disorder is largely the result of factions and cultural immaturity. Europe through Christianity has led the world in organizing productive human behavior. Christianity's mature message can be distilled into a few universal values that will help all people and bring about world solidarity. What is the Rimini Meeting? This year, and every year since 1980, in August more than eight-hundred-thousand people have attended a summer festival of culture, post-graduate, level philosophy, art, theology, science and political seminars. It is exquisitely organized by a small group of full-time Meeting employees and 2000 volunteers from Italy and ten other European countries. This year's reaffirmation of European culture included what the Italians justifiably call Spettacoli. There were presentations of Don Quixote, Shakespeare, Raffaelo, Mozart, The Vilnius Orchestra, the Variations of Goldberg and J.S. Bach and the Blues Brothers Band. For the sportsminded, there was mountain trekking, an international basketball tournament, a triathlon and bicycle race to the Republic of San Marino. This steep up hill climb, worthy of Lance Armstrong, is an excellent metaphor for what the Meeting is attempting to achieve. If size is a measure of success, the Meeting is succeeding. Three years ago, the city of Rimini had to jettison a beautiful central city convention center and build a suburban colossus just to hold this event. The Rimini Fiera or meeting place consists of fourteen gigantic air hanger-like auditoria, seven-on-a-side bisected by a mile long manmade river. The giant atrium, is fronted by four soaring rectangular towers. This complex celebrates Western culture and the defiant towers seem to proclaim, at least to this American, if you knock down two, four will rise. The genius of the conference is its openness to all perspectives and the emphasis on the similar condition and predicaments of all mankind. It proclaims that we are all in this life together. The invitation of St. Paul is exalted, to sift everything and keep that which has value. The Meeting is self-described as a source of interest for all curious, lively and attentive people whatever their view of the world. If it sounds like more namby-pamby multiculturalism, it is not. In addition to tolerance, the European identity of this conclave is emphatic. The mantra is that European culture, has lead and shaped the world and yes, it is better than all others, because it has matured to be inclusive. It also struggles not to enforce ritual but rather, seeks answers to humankind's problems. Christian dominated Europe's sins of the past are acknowledged but the cutting-edge social evolution of the West is the guiding force. The Dalai Lama and the Pope, Iraqi and Afghani, Palestinian and Jew all make the pilgrimage here because no specific dogma or policies are proclaimed, only common universal values. These somewhat vague but evident truths are family, religion, tolerance, compassion and excellence. The argument is made that these precepts have vaulted Christian Europe to cultural preeminence and they represent the obvious formula for future world solidarity. The Rimini Meeting assures us that they are not seeking world dominance for Christian Europe. Rather, they insist upon historical acknowledgment of their accomplishments and retention of those European values that are universal. Iraqi Foreign Minister Al Zebari and his Italian counterpart, Gianfranco Fini, ended the meeting and, perhaps, said it best. Al Zebari informed the mostly European audience that Iraqi democracy will be different than Europe's because it must acknowledge its Muslim heritage. However, it will be founded upon the universal values that Christian Europe has enshrined. Fini nodded his head vigorously. The Italian Minister then said that these shared values demand world solidarity. Twenty-five years ago, the world supported the Polish Solidarity movement, and at this time all Europeans must be Iraqi. The two embraced as brothers to the roars of thousands. Hold on world, the cultural giant Europe, once again spurred by, the Italians, is stirring. Article copyright the Italian Voice.","Ciongoli, Kenneth",Italian Voice,2005-09-29,1
"AN official, government-approved guide to terms common in Ireland, released this week on the Internet, promises to make Irish political jargon easy to understand - even to Americans. The avowed aim of the publication, produced by the National Adult Literacy Agency (NALA), is to help the estimated 500,000 people in Ireland who have difficulties with literacy or numeracy. But it should also be of help to visitors or immigrants trying to come to grips with confusing terms. Dr. Katherine Zappone of the school of Hebrew, Biblical and Theological Studies at Trinity College in Dublin compiled the glossary of terms, ranging from the obscure to the deceptively simple. For example, the uninitiated might think that 'BMW' should call to mind a well-engineered German car. In Ireland, however, it's an acronym for Border, Midlands and Western region, the European Union bureaucracy-speak for a 13-county subdivision of Ireland. Some of the definitions may prove controversial, such as the entry for fair - unbiased or equal. There are some in Irish politics, including the right-of-center Progressive Democrats, whose leaders include Justice Minister Michael McDowell and Tanaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Mary Harney, who might disagree. Indeed, the political parties themselves are given entries. The ruling Fianna Fail, the English translation of which -- Soldiers of Destiny -- is not provided, is defined as National political party founded in 1926 with a democratic Republican ethos. Opposition party Fine Gael, however, is merely referred to as, National political party founded in 1933. A NALA spokesperson explained that the booklet is aimed particularly at people working in government, political organizations and the voluntary sector who are involved with active citizenship. But it is also a resource for members of the public, helping to create a greater understanding of the jargon relating to many aspects of citizenship, he added. The booklet is entitled A Plain English Guide to Active Citizenship and is to be distributed to libraries around the country. It is also available for download on the internet at www.nala.ie. Spokespersons stressed that the publication, some 36 pages long and including some 400 definitions, is not meant to be an official guide to citizenship or for its definitions to have legal force - which must be of some comfort to the political parties. The guide also strives to be up-to-date. It includes such more recently-introduced words as burqa, defined as a garment a Muslim woman wears to cover herself head to foot. Also included are references to fatwas - an Islamic ruling issued by holy men that Muslims are expected to obey. Reference is omitted to the most recent prominent applications of the practice, such as to issue a death warrant on author Salman Rushdie. Gerrymander, an American import that refers to the manipulation of the borders of electoral districts for partisan advantage, is also mentioned in the guide. But no mention of its Massachusetts origin is made. Article copyright Irish Tribune.","Delevan, Richard",Irish Voice,2005-09-28,1
"Belfast actor Ciaran Hinds stars as Julius Caesar in HBO's $100 million series, Rome, the largest mini-series ever shown on U.S. or British television. He's escaped the publicity circuit to do a new Steven Spielberg movie in Malta. This year, he also stars in a superb Irish drama about two boys who escaped the Troubles. IMAGINE the lives of three struggling Irish actors in the early 1980s. Ballymena, Co. Antrim actor Liam Neeson filmed Lamb, a low budget but well received film about a priest who escapes to London with a young boy. Neeson would go through long periods of down time, but was touring with various Irish theater companies. Gabriel Byrne finished up regular work on the rural soap opera, Bracken, and earned international attention for a leading role in the Medieval film Excalibur. In Northern Ireland, Neeson's friend, Ciaran Hinds, also earns a part on Excalibur, but it would be eight long years before he is seen on the screens again, this time on the forgotten mini-series The Mahabharata. Fast forward to 2005. Byrne's career is struggling after his huge success in The Usual Suspects with Kevin Spacey. Liam Neeson's career has exploded, starring in the latest Batman movie following roles in the Star Wars trilogy and in the lead role in the biopic Kinsey. The real surprise is Ciaran Hinds, whose slow haul through the acting ranks earns him a place as Julius Caesar in the HBO/BBC co-production Rome, for which he has earned almost universal acclaim. He finished filming this year when he dashed off to Malta to star in Steven Spielberg's new movie about the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics, when Palestinian terrorists killed Israeli athletes. The film follows the true-life story of Israeli Secret Service agents who hunt down and execute the masterminds of the Munich attack. Spielberg is so concerned that the film may come off as anti-Muslim and inflame the situation in the Middle East that he has given a copy of the script to Bill Clinton and asked how best to avoid the controversy. It's some testament to Hinds' huge demand that he is the only major actor on Rome who has completely avoided the publicity tours and didn't show up for the premiere in Los Angeles late last month. In Rome, he plays Caesar as aloof and calculating, prepared to take on the Roman aristocracy after he has led his legions on a bloody eight-year campaign in France. Hinds' natural reserve suits the role. In the first episode, broadcast last week, Caesar's symbolic golden eagle is stolen. He orders as many Gauls as necessary to be crucified and tortured until someone gives up information. In one of many graphic scenes in the series, we see the nails being driven into the hands of prisoners before their crosses are raised. Later, we learn that Caesar may have arranged for the eagle to be stolen so that he could move against his rivals in Rome. The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times both strongly praised his role as powerful and accomplished. Even newspapers that slated Rome as overblown and slow have praised his role as convincing. So how did a bit actor from Belfast end up in the lead role of the biggest production ever mounted by either HBO or the BBC? The perceived view in Hollywood is that it wasn't until Tom Hanks' Irish American gangster epic, The Road to Perdition in 2002 that Hinds' role as the gangster, Finn McGovern, finally earned him serious attention. In the same year, he starred as President Nemerov of Russia in the Colin Farrell movie The Sum of All Fears, cementing his role as a cold, calculating Hollywood bad guy. Those two major roles caught far more attention than his leading role in the gripping British TV film, The Mayor of Casterbridge. He won wide acclaim for the role, a relief from his part in forgotten TV movies likes The Sleeper and Jason and the Argonauts. There were also parts in 1998's Northern Ireland movie, Titanic Town and as Reverend Dennis Hasset in the film version of the classic novel, Oscar and Lucinda. In the mid-1990s Irish audiences may remember him from the gritty IRA hunger strike movie, Some Mother's Son, in 1996, or in the acclaimed film version of Maeve Binchy's Circle of Friends the previous year. Add in some very questionable roles in cheesy TV series (Tales from the Crypt and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes in the mid-1990s) and you have a career dominated by bit roles until just three years ago. This year could see him emerge as a major Hollywood name, if HBO's massive risk on Rome pays off. In many ways it's the perfect role for Hinds, combining both his Hollywood villain with his reputation in Britain as an excellent period drama actor, starring in Ivanhoe, Jane Eyre, Richard III and many others. He was due to be seen in the Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx remake (oh, God) of the 1980s TV show, Miami Vice, in which he was due to have a prominent role as Lieutenant Castillo. However, news emerged this week that his hectic schedule has gotten in the way and the role has gone to Barry Shabaka Henley, seen recently in Four Brothers. With 1970s and '80s remakes mass-produced and bombing at the box office this year, being axed from Miami Vice might be a good move. Instead, Hinds appears in the delightful low budget movie, Mickybo and Me, about two boys who share a love of Hollywood westerns and decide to escape to Australia at the start of the Northern Ireland Troubles. Hinds plays the father of one of the boys in a movie that avoids the sentimental cliché of so many across the barricades Northern Ireland films. It was a welcome return to Belfast for Hinds. The youngest of five children, he came from a stable middle class family. His sister, Bronagh Hinds, is a famous Northern Ireland academic, feminist and peace campaigner. His father had hoped he would follow him into medicine, but he was much more inspired by his mother's role in amateur drama in Belfast. After a bout at law school in Queens University in Belfast, Hinds dropped out to learn acting, earning his first ignominious role as the back end of a pantomime house in a pantomime production of Cinderella in Glasgow. He joined RADA and the even more prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company, touring the world while picking up costume drama roles as Mr. Rochester in Jane Eyre, and Captain Wentworth in Persuasion. Despite his recent high profile, Hinds is very rarely in the tabloids, his domestic life considered too stable for scandal-raking. He is a long-term relationship with French-Vietnamese actress Hélène Patarot. The couple have a daughter, Aoife, and live in London. In a British newspaper interview last year, Hinds explained his secret for staying out of tabloid hell. I think there is this natural Belfast reserve, he said. Outside of anything political, there is a tendency to keep your cards close and not reveal too much to anyone. I think that's a good thing to have if you are ever confronted with reporters looking for muck to throw at you. I've learned to stay quite, say nothing and keep working. I've been very lucky. I'm not about to let it go. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Belfast actor Ciaran Hinds)","O'Driscoll, Sean",Irish Voice,2005-09-07,1
"Following is the full text of President Victor Yushchenko's speech on the occasion of Ukrainian Independence Day, August 24, which was delivered that day on Independence Square in Kyiv. (The text has been edited for clarity.) Dear Ukrainians, everybody that hears and sees me, glorious, historic Maidan: Today we celebrate the greatest creation of the Ukrainian nation - the independent and free Ukrainian state. Fourteen years ago we asserted our right to be masters in our own house. I am proud to be a part of this nation. We had enough strength and unity to make this irreversible step. We have chosen statehood as the main purpose for our land and as a talent for every one of us. We could not make a different choice because, like guardian angels, our great ancestors stand behind us. They left behind not only a few lines in history books. From them we inherited spiritual strength and special Ukrainian identity, born from glory, labors and patience of many generations. Rus'-Ukraine freely chose its religion and Prince Volodymyr was christened not a leader of a subjugated nation but a leader of a state that stretched from Korus in the Crimea to the Baltic shores. Byzantium, the Muslim world and European states sought alliances with that ancient Ukraine. From those times we have sustained confidence that we can decide our own fate, we can be equal among other peoples. St. Sophia, where prayers for our state are held every year on this date, was built in those days. Our Ukrainian Kozak state has instilled a firm belief in us that everybody has their rights and liberties, and that it is everybody's sacred duty to defend them. That was where our ancestors were taught honor and dignity, equality and democracy. The first constitution in Europe, written by Pylyp Orlyk, is an eternal testimonial to Ukrainian thought and Ukrainian freedom. From that time on, our history has shown that our people will forever strive for freedom. Shevchenko's prophetic words, the works of such thinkers and freedom fighters as Franko and Hrushevsky, Khvyliovyi and Stus, have instilled in us our firm belief in Ukraine. This belief sheds eternal light on the roads traveled and those lying ahead of us. Even in the worst of times our fathers and grandfathers did not forsake it. The greatest tragedies in the history of humankind tested our nation in the past century. With two world wars, the Holodomor and the Holocaust, and the destruction of our spiritual relics, foreign empires wanted to turn our land into their obedient district. Every second man and every fourth woman perished in Ukraine between the years 1914 and 1915. Our family tree has lost a lot of its best branches. It is written, however, Nobody lives for himself and nobody dies for himself. The fates of those who are gone trouble the ones living. We, the Ukrainians, have learned a significant historic truth: only freedom can save the people, only independence can lead them to a prosperous and peaceful world. Since then, that truth has been living in the heart of every Ukrainian. Millions of people have sustained it with their sweat and blood. The victory over Nazism, the 60th anniversary of which we celebrate this year, was a heroic feat accomplished by many in the name of the life and freedom of our people. Time and time again I turn to you, our dear veterans and our brave soldiers who, under many flags, fought for Ukraine. It is the right and honorable thing to shake hands on Independence Day. I believe that some already did it in May, some - earlier, some will do it today, and some will do it tomorrow. Do not leave the old enmities for your grandchildren. Better than anybody else you know the price of liberation and the price of Ukrainian unity. The desire to see our native country free gave us the strength to raise Ukraine from the ruins. The restoration of the Khreschatyk and the Donbas after the war, the launches of the Dnipropetrovsk rockets and the Mykolayiv ships, the record-breaking yields of the fields of Tavria, and the flights of the Ruslan and Mria are all steps toward Ukrainian statehood. It was brought closer by our scientists' discoveries, by unique surgeries done by Ukrainian doctors, by poetic Ukrainian cinematography, by honest and wise books - by everything made through the genius and labor of the people. Independent Ukraine has remained the purpose of life for millions of our fellow countrymen living in fa-away lands. For its sake they preserved everything Ukrainian within themselves. They told the world the truth about Ukraine, stretched out their helping hand and rejoiced over our victory with us. Our statehood has ripened by the end of summer like an apple in Dovzhenko's orchard. Together we built it - our independence, our free Ukraine. We remember everything we lived through and we did. Memory has become an inseparable part of our identity. We know that Ukraine is being built by every one of us, regardless of the language they speak, the church they attend, or the political preferences they have. We all have one fate and one Ukraine. Dear friends: We would like to preserve the dearest of what we have: children and families, peace and tranquility, jobs and prosperity, hope and belief. We know that only respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and justice can accomplish that. These are our values. They hold our unity and our strength. And we are ready to defend them. We proved it that last fall on this glorious maidan. The freedom won here does not belong to any single political force. Millions of people who came through cold and snow defended the honor and dignity of every person in Donetsk and in Lviv, in Sumy and in Crimea. With every passing day people are better able to see it. The victory of freedom has strengthened our independence and reaffirmed our choice made in 1991. This year's surveys show that, for the first time in 14 years, most Ukrainian citizens called their country truly independent. We have come through a tough trial. Ukraine has emerged before the entire world as a country on a unique mission. I believe that we will be worthy of it. For thousands of years, borders that divided Europe used to go along our borders or even cross our land. Nonetheless, they failed to divide us. The freedom and unity of Ukraine and the stability of our state prove that the old quarrels can be set aside. Our example shows that peoples from the Baltic to the Black Sea can be successful modeling their countries, building democracies and guaranteeing security. This is why so many of our neighbors are paying close attention to us and are seeing Ukraine as a regional leader. Not only do we see our future as being a part of the United Europe, but we also believe that Ukraine's success can open new horizons for the entire continent. I believe that, in the near future, it will not be possible to imagine a new Europe without Ukraine, without its borders and its role in the contemporary world. As president, I represented the new Ukraine in the capitals of many near and far countries. All negotiations were carried out in the language of national interests. The world has started reckoning with us. We are invited to participate in important projects both in the West and in the East. We have earned a historic chance to become a modern, prosperous and respected state. Dear Ukrainians: I want to say the main thing! I am convinced we will unveil our potential. And we should know that prosperity cannot be presented on a platter. The country's progress, freedom, democracy and welfare are made by millions of hands. All of us will have to work hard. We should be firm, single-minded, united and respectful of each other. That is how we won a victory on the maidan and how we will win in the future. We have every reason to speak about our prospects. Only a strong nation could have changed the country so radically over the last months. Today we speak about Ukraine, very often using the phrase for the first time. For the first time we can express our ideas freely. There are no issues and persons forbidden for the media. A journalist criticizing the authorities risks neither his or her work nor life. Freedom of speech - the alpha and omega of democracy - has become a reality in Ukraine. We have an opportunity to breathe freely, and we are now learning to do it. For the first time social justice was not only declared but made the top priority in the work of the new government. As it was envisaged by my electoral program, the budget was meant for the people. Pensioners got a minimum pension equal to a living wage for the first time. A mother who gave birth to a child got decent financial aid from the state for the first time. I know that there is a long way to go to defeat poverty, yet people saw a gleam of hope. For the first time social programs include points concerning the disabled, orphans, servicemen, teachers and doctors. And they can depend on the state more surely year after year. Ukrainian business deliberately supported changes in the country. For the first time it demonstrates its willingness to move out of the shadows, to get over shadow barriers and to pay taxes fairly. Entrepreneurs demand stable and fair rules of play rather than privileges. And for the first time the state offers partnership instead of pressure. And the most important thing is that the nation has awakened. Millions of people feel they are citizens for the first time; they are aware of high responsibility for their state, their families and their own fates. We became stronger as we understood that everything was up to us. This strength enables us to speak honestly about our life, looking into each other's eyes. And I know that hope is next to anxiety in our hearts. We know why it is so - everything is not so perfect, yet there are no difficulties that we are unable to overcome. We are entering a new stage. New faces came to power, still the face of this new power did not change much. Dealing with newly appointed officials, citizens see the same bureaucracy and indifference to their problems. I will not accept this. And staff replacements will go on. Those, who think that the first wave has passed and that they can work as before are absolutely wrong. We have enough decent and honest professionals, and I will clear the way for them. I have always been guided by one thing in evaluating the work of state officials: their ability to see not a paper but a person, their readiness to support an orphan, the disabled or the jobless. Such people are trusted, and we will take them to power. Corruption is retreating rather slowly. The former system often grinds down newcomers before they can change it. We are beginning an offensive against corruption. All top officials will declare their incomes and expenditures. From letters, appeals and polls it is well-known where corruption is flourishing now. I demand that the government and law-enforcement bodies closely control customs, the sphere of land, and the process of granting permits and licenses. Next year we will introduce a common university entrance test. We will raise the status of doctors and provide proper health care financing. We will cut the ground out from under corruption's feet. Law-enforcers have not been able to do away with crime, yet they are making progress in this direction. Their weak point is patronizing criminals, being closely tied to them. Law-enforcement bodies will protect us instead of filling their pockets. My decision to reorganize the State Automobile Inspection is a warning to everybody: your status won't relieve you of responsibility. Order on the roads will be secured by other bodies that will help drivers instead of humiliating them. Another problem is the current economic situation. It is the economy that is the basis for the nation's welfare. And we know that the way toward prosperity is not paved with flowers. The young, enthusiastic and self-confident government has demonstrated both a macroeconomic culture and an increase in social standards. A good combination of these two priorities is the formula for a modern economy that encourages the strong and supports the weak. There should be consistent actions and long-term objectives to keep such a balance. The first one is high technology, which can become our economy's engine, create well-paid jobs quickly and provide high social standards. We have things to offer the world community within the aerospace, communications and energy industries. I have commissioned the government to encourage innovations and to create comfortable conditions for investments in all spheres. The state's proper assistance inspires other branches of the economy and culture. The state will particularly focus on the coal, engineering and steel industries. In recent days I visited the Alchevsk steel plant and saw updated production meeting the highest world standards. There I saw the largest national investment made in the last 14 years, 2.5 billion hrv - directed not to buy yachts but to modernize a certain enterprise. The task of the government is to give such incentives to renovate all basic branches of national economy. Dear friends: Next year is to be the year of the countryside. Efficient support of the agrarian sector will give us the opportunity to eat our own bread. Ukrainian farmers will gain a proper and stable position on world food markets. Millions of people are searching for spiritual support. The people want to hear the voice of their intellectuals - artists, writers, historians and ethnographers. And your mission is to show the spiritual world to our society through your works and safeguard our culture against mediocrity. And a renovated single Ukrainian Orthodox Church is to fulfill its high-profile mission of returning the nation to its traditions. Dear friends: We are in for extensive structural changes within the economy and the social sphere: from judicial to municipal reforms. They are to be understood and widely supported by citizens. I demand that the government conduct a dialogue, convince the people and show the advantages of each party interested in this process. I am sure that this applies mostly to reforming our political system. In November the people rallied since the old regime had exhausted its potential. We need mechanisms that will allow the people to control the authorities, to take part in the decision-making process and to assert their rights and interests. Together we will build this system. Dear Ukrainian people: Only through joint efforts can we guarantee that we won't return to the past. One of these guarantees is the efficiency of the future Parliament. I believe there are enough patriots among our national deputies to raise the vote threshold [for election to] the Verkhovna Rada. Thus, we will have a real representative power rather than a club of political parties' owners. I believe in the people's wisdom and that in the spring we will have a Parliament able to accelerate changes, represent different interests and at the same time unite our country around democratic values. The fairly elected Parliament will learn the lessons of the recent past. Democracy is the daily influence of the people over the government. And I am happy that an awakened nation is searching and finding ways to do it. In Kyiv the people rally to defend a historic building, in Donetsk - the rights of accident victims. There are hundreds of such examples. This is our country, and what is happening here is our affair. I welcome the initiatives of civil organizations, trade unions and others. Together we will consolidate our democracy. My dear friends: Independence is a symbol of our nation. It reminds us of our glorious forefathers. And we will get over all our difficulties. We are talented and strong enough to fulfill our dreams. The most important thing is being united. Together we can do everything, and separately - nothing. Happy holiday, dear compatriots! Every happiness and prosperity to our independent and unified Ukraine! Glory to you, glory to all of us, glory to God and glory to Ukraine!

"The Infidel. Novel by Pierre Piccard. Edited by Sean Virgo 1-894345-77-0. 192 pages. 5.5 x 8.5 Paper $15.95 CDN $13.95 US BISAC: FIC 019000 fiction/literary; FIC 0014000 fiction/historical; FIC fiction/alternative history. Available in the U.S. September 2005. Thistledown Press, 633 Main St., Saskatoon, SK. S7H 0J8 Canada. Website; www.thistledown.sk.ca Set in contemporary Turkey, The Infidel weighs the elements of truth that wash out of Turkey's consciousness in the wake of its historical massacres. In a culture where civic events, history and theology are as often tranquilized or invented, Piccard's novel creates a path to truth for those with ears to hear and eyes to see. Told through a series of tape recordings and commentary, the eloquent narrative of Jesus the Infidel becomes the eyewitness account of the formative events that occurred in Turkish Kurdistan in the first quarter of the twentieth century. What is revealed is as much enigma as it is story for the journalist, Tarik, who records and researches Jesus the Infidel's account. In counterpoint, Tarik is forced to grapple with his own ignorance of his country's past as well as his own personal history of privilege. Authentic and persuasive, The Infidel is an uncompromising novel of the focused turning point of what follows when truth is revealed. At a time when the world is alerted to the Kurdish people's desire for separatism, Piccard's novel sets the backdrop for their motivation. Pierre Piccard knows the Middle East intimately; he has been a missionary there for most of his adult life. He has studied at Prairie Bible College, the Universities of Jordan, Istanbul, Syracuse, and South Africa, speaks Arabic and Turkish, and has degrees in Theology and Social Science. He teaches Theology, Cross-Cultural Communication and History of Christian/Muslim Relations at a theological institute in the region. Piccard is Canadian. His wife, Anna, is Irish. They have two teenage children. SYNOPSIS The Infidel enables the Westerner to grasp a baffling history of the Armenian Genocide and the Turkish historical evolution in a compelling story of Jesus the Infidel, born Christian, raised Muslim and searching for his place in the world. The Infidel describes the fall of Turkey of the post-Ottoman Empire and the region's subsequent story of religion, race, and politics, as seen through the eyes of one of the last members of a Christian minority. In so doing, the book reveals something of the intercultural and inter-religious dynamics of oft misunderstood, yet hugely important aspects of contemporary Middle Eastern history. The story itself is told through the reports of a contemporary journalist, privileged and secure, who encounters the truth of Turkey's past through the stories of his subject, Jesus the Infidel, now an old man but once a vibrant youth who survived The Young Turks massacre of Christians in 1914 to be raised a Muslim by a kind, traveling rural dentist. Taking the reader deep into the Turkish past, its cities and its ways of life, this novel allows what is, at one turn, a firsthand account of Turkish life to become a catalyst for change in the life of the journalist who roots out the story. It is the classic struggle of religion and politics. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2005-09-03,1
"One recent Saturday afternoon, in the enervating heat and noise of Istanbul, the holiest man in the Orthodox Christian Church joined a queue to catch a ferry. His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I stood in line with about 200 others, mostly tourists, bound for the little island of Heybeliada, about an hour's ride from the city. For many of those boarding the boat, a visit to the island is part of the experience of being in Istanbul, something recommended in the guidebooks. It has excellent beaches, a naval high school and a watersports club popular with Istanbul's rich. The Patriarch might have been just another day-tripper too, were it not for his long black cassock, the beautiful staff he carried, and a small entourage fussing around him and carrying briefcases and his travel bags. Still, even that was not enough to merit the attention of most of the other travellers, anxious to get a good seat on the ferry. They might have glanced at the man in black, but they did not acknowledge him. The Patriarch doesn't normally queue, he admits a few minutes later, when I remark on the informality of his embarkation. As the boat manoeuvres around the stretch of water where the Bosphorus joins the Marmara sea and begins our journey, he explains that the Patriarchate is awaiting the delivery of a new private boat to replace one that was sold recently. Until it arrives, he says, he is happy to line up with everybody else. Bartholomew is the 270th occupier of the Patriarchate of Constantinople, one of the founding churches of Christendom. For his followers he is first among equals among the patriarchs of his church. His position is not universally accepted; in the notoriously schismatic Orthodox Church there is intense rivalry between Bartholomew and Alexei II of Moscow, whom the Russian church - and perhaps the Russian government - would claim to be Bartholomew's equal (they are involved in a fierce battle for the allegiance of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine). And since the Orthodox Church is organised more along national lines than the Roman Catholic Church, there is frequent dispute among the patriarchy. Still, Bartholomew is regarded, especially in Greece and the Anglo-Saxon world, as the leader of the world's 300 million Orthodox Christians, and he has the mien and bearing of a man of influence. And for him, a visit to Heybeliada - known in Greek as Halki - is more a pilgrimage than a day out. It is also a political act. At the summit of this speck of land stands a Greek Orthodox seminary that has been at the centre of an extraordinary dispute between Orthodox Christians and the authorities in Turkey since it was closed by Ankara in 1971. The dispute pits Turkey's fiercely secular authorities against one of the world's great Christian churches. It raises a profound question about the degree to which Turkey - whose prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is said to pray at least three times a day - is committed historically and constitutionally to secularism. Can it grant rights to minority religions that it is not willing to grant to the majority faith? It also poses a dilemma both for Turkey and for Europe: can a Muslim country that aspires to join the European Union embrace freedom of religion and remain committed to stifling political Islam? The seminary, built on the site of the Holy Trinity monastery, is a splendid piece of mid-19th century school architecture, airy, high-ceilinged and with views of the sea or the city in every direction. It was opened in 1844, during a period of reform in the late Ottoman empire known as the Tanzimat, as a theological school to train priests for the Orthodox Church. The Patriarch himself was a student here from 1954 to 1961, and he describes it as a perfect place between Earth and heaven. The seminary was closed as part of a campaign by the Turkish state beginning in the 1960s to rein in private educational institutions, which were felt to be a threat to the state ethos, especially if they were religious institutions. The seminary was included in this crackdown partly through a legal ruling that it could not remain independent. So it was officially discontinued. And despite a three-decade campaign by the church to reopen it, that is how it remains. The silence of the seminary's halls and classrooms and the threat from neglect to its library of theological and history books and old manuscripts, are emblematic of a wider problem: what Orthodox Christians claim is the systematic mistreatment of the Patriarchate over many years by successive Turkish governments. They say Ankara has confiscated not only the seminary but thousands of buildings - churches, schools, hospitals - that are the property of the Patriarchate, impoverishing it in a deliberate attempt to destroy it, or force it to leave Istanbul, where it has resided for 1,700 years. So the conduct of the Turkish government, Orthodox Christians claim, is both an offence against Turkish history and a rebuke to the principle of religious freedom enshrined in the constitution. Every visit the Patriarch makes to the seminary, including the one he will make on this trip to Heybeliada, is therefore a way of reminding the authorities of what the church considers a violation of its historical and constitutional rights. We are a part of this country, born and educated here, His All Holiness tells me on the ferry, in a voice that is both grave and soft. That is why we are so disappointed, because although we [Orthodox Christians] are part of this country we are treated as second-class citizens. Because of our faith and our national background [essentially Greek] we are seen in a different way [to Muslim Turks]. It is a shame and a pity to have such a beautiful place empty when the Patriarchate has such great need of it. After his visit to the seminary, the Patriarch attends to the immediate task that has brought him to Heybeliada: the reopening and reconsecration of the tiny church of St Nicholas in the island's little seaside town. Dressed in his most elaborate ecclesiastical robes and attended by several priests, some of whom have travelled from Greece, he begins the elaborate ceremony with prayers, incense and hymns sung in deep male voices. There is quite a crowd: most are tourists from Greece or from Istanbul's tiny Greek Orthodox community, or have been invited especially for the occasion regardless of their religion. The church has a plain exterior, but its interior is full of iconography: Jesus Christ, Mary, the saints. Its vaulted ceiling draws the gaze upwards towards the icons and decoration on the walls, and the high altar is a rich elaboration of wood and gold. Like a lot of interiors of Orthodox Christian churches, its decoration seems excessive. It is a vivid contrast with the places and forms of Muslim worship in Turkey. There are many wonderfully elaborate mosques all over the country; the collection of great mosques in Sultanahmet and Fatih, in old Istanbul, is among the world's finest. But their elaboration is an exterior one; inside they are as austere and simple as the ceremonies they hold. Still, not even the fascination of the ceremony at St Nicholas can keep everybody entranced; the stifling heat soon sends some of the congregation outside, where evening is approaching and it is a little cooler. The Patriarchate - which is for Orthodox Christians what the Vatican is for Roman Catholics - is a collection of mostly wooden buildings that sits squarely in the middle of old Istanbul, in a district called Fener. Once this area was home to a sizeable population of Jews and ethnic Greeks; now it is among the most conservative Muslim quarters of the city. Women here are invariably covered from head to toe; their menfolk sit in teashops smoking and chatting. It seems an odd place for the world headquarters of a Christian church. This modest compound is the focal point of Istanbul's Greek Orthodox Christian community. Inside, it is a warren of corridors and rooms where informality appears to be the norm. Visitors to His All Holiness bow and kiss his hand on meeting him, but there is none of the ritual that surrounds the Pope in Rome. Outside, guards hover at the gate and there is airport-style security. On the advice of the local mayor, the Patriarch has a police bodyguard - seated discreetly behind us on the ferry - because of occasional hostility from neighbourhood nationalists. The Orthodox community in Turkey has three main components: Armenian, Greek and Syrian. Figures for how many adherents each branch has are difficult to find - the census does not classify them. Official estimates, however, suggest about 3,000 Greek Orthodox Christians, and there is little doubt that the community has been in decline for many years. Its interaction with the wider Turkish community in the city has invariably reflected over the years the state of relations between Turkey and Greece, which were antagonistic for many decades until the late 1990s but are now the warmest they have been for years (the prime ministers of the two countries are friends). The relationship between Turkey and Greece is ancient and complex. But to understand their postwar history, it is necessary to recount the fate of the Greek Orthodox community in Istanbul. If nothing else, it helps to explain why there are so few members of that community today. In 1955, over a period of about 24 hours on September 6 and 7, Istanbul witnessed a mob assault against its ethnic Greek inhabitants that marked the beginning of the end for the community and the Orthodox Church in the city. This community numbered about 100,000 at the time, when Istanbul was much smaller than it is today. The precise cause of what the Greek-American historian Speros Vryonis, in an exhaustive new history of the incident, calls a pogrom (ie that it was orchestrated by government forces) is complex. But it started when reports reached Istanbul that the house where Mustafa Kemal Ataturk - the founder of the republic of Turkey - is said to have been born, in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, had been bombed by Greek nationalists. The reports were not true; even today the origins of the reports appear unclear. Within a few hours hundreds of Greek businesses and institutions in Istanbul were ransacked and about 40 people were killed. Walking the pleasant district of Cihangir in central Istanbul now, where much of the community lived, one sees houses on every other street standing empty even as the neighbourhood undergoes rapid gentrification. These are the homes of Greek families who fled after 1955 and that now exist in a kind of legal limbo awaiting some resolution that is not forthcoming. By the Besiktas fish market an Orthodox church stands silent and shrouded, and opposite it a school appears to be rotting away. These were centres of Greek life in Istanbul at one time; now they are reminders of an ugly and barely remembered incident in the city's recent history. Perhaps this is why Istanbul now feels like a city with something missing. Many residents of the city regret 1955 deeply. Today, however, thanks in part to the remarkable turnaround in Turkish/Greek relations, the Greek Orthodox community's prospects may be brightening. Not only is the Patriarch a widely respected and much-liked man; the community, like many small minorities, is mostly wealthy and successful, and some of those who left in the 1970s and 1980s are returning to reclaim and renovate their properties, according to Alexis Alexandris, the consul-general of Greece in Istanbul. One legacy of the disaster that befell the Greek Orthodox community in 1955, though, may be paradoxical: it has created a greater sense of its position inside Turkey today. What the community seeks now from the Turkish state - the reopening of the seminary on Heybeliada and a recognition of the Patriarch's ecumenical status as a worldwide leader - they seek as Turkish citizens rather than as a religious minority. Part of the dismay the Patriarch feels at his treatment by the state is that he is intensely loyal to that state. I spent two years in the Turkish army, he tells me. We [Orthodox Christians] pay our taxes, obey the laws, and we are very loyal citizens. So the quarrel between the Orthodox Church and Turkey is not one between Christians and Muslims. It is one between the church and the country's secular authorities; and the stakes are high. Activists in the Orthodox Church say the very survival of the Patriarchate is at issue. For Turkey, the dispute raises a fascinating question about the place of religion in a secular society. It asks searching questions about Ankara's treatment of minority religions. These questions, in turn, trouble the European Union, which Turkey wishes to join and which has absolute positions on such principles as religious freedom. The controversy offers a revealing glimpse of the dilemmas that Turkey faces as it becomes a freer and more democratic society. Despite - or perhaps because of - the high stakes, Turkey has trouble making its case for the defence. This may be because Turkey does not have one: the fate of the seminary on Heybeliada appears, on the face of it, to be open and shut. Or it may be because it is unwilling to undertake a unilateral act before October 3, when it begins the formal EU accession process. Reopening the seminary could therefore be a bargaining chip to be played at a more propitious moment. The issue is extremely sensitive, nonetheless. Not only did both the directorate of religious affairs and the foreign ministry decline to speak on the record for this article; it is difficult to ascertain even what the official position is on the seminary. What is clear, however, is that reopening it is not a simple matter. If it were, a decree to do so would have been issued long ago because, officials assured me, the government is predisposed to finding a solution. But, the officials said, reopening the seminary presents a complicated legal, political, diplomatic and electoral quandary for the current government, which is headed by the most openly devout Muslim prime minister in Turkey's recent history. I first got a sense of how potent the quarrel is becoming about three months ago, during a conversation with two Americans over coffee in an Istanbul hotel. Anthony Limberakis is a radiologist in Philadelphia, and one of the leading members - or archons - of the Greek Orthodox church in the US. With him was Father Alex Karloutsos, an Orthodox priest from Long Island. They had arrived in Istanbul from Brussels, which has become the latest and, arguably, the most important battleground in the seminary dispute. The Patriarch himself was there a few weeks ago, raising the issue with the European Commission and expressing his support for Turkey's EU membership. Limberakis and Karloutsos say they also support Turkey's EU bid. But there is a sense of urgency in their words, and not a little anger. The plight of the Patriarchate inside Turkey, Limberakis says, is an impending catastrophe. We are talking about the very survival of the spiritual centre of world Orthodoxy. For a secular country to be consumed with [a perceived threat from] a few thousand Christians is very perplexing. Turkey ought to be greater than that. He also finds insulting Turkey's refusal to recognise the term Ecumenical in the Patriarch's title, which refers to his worldwide vocation. Karloutsos hands me a list of properties listed as confiscated by the government of Turkey between 1974 and 2002. It contains details of 153 hospitals owned by the Patriarchate that were, in effect, nationalised by the state during that time. The list is part of a hefty batch of documents presented to the US. Congress (which Karloutsos also gives me) as part of an intense lobbying effort that has won the backing of powerful US politicians and church leaders. Limberakis and Karloutsos have now turned their attention to the EU, aware that it offers the best immediate hope for a solution. During the accession process Turkey can expect the minutest scrutiny of its record in observing and implementing human and civil rights. Its record is poor but improving; its stance on the seminary, according to diplomats in Ankara, will be a test of how far it is prepared to go to accept certain principles that may conflict with its current, secular constitutional settlement. On the face of it, this settlement ordains a strict separation between the state and religion in Turkey. Ataturk decreed that the country was to be secular, nationalist, republican, popular, statist and modern. These are its governing principles today, 82 years after it was created from the ruins of the Ottoman empire. So the people of Turkey, the majority of whom are Sunni Muslims, are free to worship. But what and even how they worship is, to a large extent, dictated by the state. One of the main functions of the Directorate of Religious Affairs, an arm of the government, is to write the sermons that are preached in mosques every Friday. Religious schooling is permissible but limited, and is tightly controlled. Many Turkish people are quite content with this arrangement, believing that it protects them from a stifling and perhaps oppressive Islam. Others are not, believing that it has left a spiritual vacuum, perhaps even a hostility to religion per se, at the heart of the Turkish state. However, as Ali Carkoglu, a professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul, puts it, the result is that Turkey does not recognise any religious authority independent of the state. This, as much as anything, is what secularism means in Turkey today. All imams [in Turkey] are state officials - clerks, basically, Carkoglu says. They follow orders. So, if [Turkey] recognises a religious authority that is not under state control, the whole system will change. The issue of the Patriarchate touches that nerve. There is an irony to Turkey's stance on secularism - or, more accurately, French-style laicism - that is not appreciated very well in the EU. By strictly controlling what they say, Turkey in general has avoided the phenomenon of radical imams that is now causing such soul-searching in Britain and France. Instead, religious practice in Turkey is largely a private matter, which is how the constitution and the secular authorities have always regarded it, Carkoglu says. According to Cengiz Aktar, a prominent Turkish academic who is the head of a Turkish/Greek friendship society, part of Turkey's dilemma about how to deal with the Patriarchate and with other Christian religions is that the authorities in Turkey do not really understand the Christian world. There are lacunae in the appreciation of the role of the Patriarchate in the world among the secular authorities, he says. In a wider sense, reopening the seminary would strengthen the position of Istanbul within the Orthodox Church. But there is no appreciation among the secular authorities that this might be beneficial for Turkey. Olli Rehn is the EU's commissioner in charge of expanding the union to include new members. He sums up the EU's position in fairly stark terms: Freedom of religion is one of the core issues to be addressed by Turkey, and the reopening of Halki is a critical litmus test of its implementation, Rehn says in a telephone interview. I have significant difficulties to understand how a tiny Christian minority could pose any threat to the Turkish state or to the predominant culture in Turkey. It should be as easy to open a church in Eskisehir [a town near Ankara] as it is to open a mosque in Finland. But it is not, for the moment. So why is Ankara not acting to reopen the seminary? In my conversations with officials and with opinion-formers who are familiar with the issue, I got a clear sense that there is a desire bordering on urgency to find a solution. They acknowledge that the reopening of the seminary, and the benefits it would bring to the Orthodox Church, present no threat to Turkey; the opposite is true. It would reap instant dividends in relations with the EU and the US. It would also help to neutralise the growing body of opinion outside Turkey that the country does not respect the fundamental value of freedom of religion. The government, rooted in the country's tradition of political Islam, arguably should have ordered the reopening of the seminary after it came to power in late 2002 on a wave of popular disenchantment with the state of Turkish politics. Perhaps it would have done had it realised how thorny the problem would become. Now, however, it may be too late for this government to act. To understand why, it is necessary to appreciate the difficulties in which Erdogan now finds himself and his government. Rehn's comment about Turkey becoming more like Finland is not glib; it cuts to the heart of the Turkish dilemma. When Erdogan and his Justice and Development party were elected, the bedrock of their support came from Muslim voters outside the big cities who were appalled at the corruption that was then (and still is) rampant, and whose way of life had been undermined by a financial crisis in 2000-2001 that scarred Turkey's emerging middle class. The government has not wiped out corruption. But it has steadied the economy, satisfying at least one demand of its core voters. Now those core voters want something else. They want their sons to be educated at religious schools (which is permitted) and then to have the freedom to pursue a university education of their choice (which is not). They may even want to make adultery a criminal offence, as Erdogan tried (and failed) to do last autumn, to the horror of secularists. Most of all, they want their daughters to be able to wear a headscarf as a matter of civil and religious liberty (covered women may not enter official buildings or attend classes at state universities, and may not be appointed to a range of jobs in the civil administration). One might say that they want what Patriarch Bartholomew wants - the freedom to govern their religious lives as they choose, without state interference. Yet whenever Erdogan tries to make concessions to these voters, he bumps up against the constitution, and sometimes even against the military, which considers itself the guardian of Ataturk's legacy. When he sought last year to allow boys from religious high schools to pursue a university education of their choosing, he was forced to abandon the measure because of fierce opposition from secularists. Despite his huge parliamentary majority (due less to the size of his core vote than to the electoral rules concerning parliamentary representation), Turkey's secular forces are remarkably powerful, and even if they cannot stop him, the constitution and constitutional court probably will. So if Erdogan cannot provide his core Muslim voters with greater religious freedom, how can he offer it to Turkey's tiny Orthodox Christian community? It would be electoral suicide. It is not that the vast majority of Turkish Muslims want to keep the seminary closed; it is that, if the Orthodox community can have a religious school independent of the state, then so should they. Turkey may ultimately be able to present a solution to the seminary closure, one that is acceptable to everybody, only through a wider move that addresses the grievances of all religions. There is no sign that this country is ready for such a constitutional upheaval. In the past, Patriarch Bartholomew has expressed his belief that the seminary on Heybeliada will one day reopen. He said he believed it would reopen as he believed in God. When I ask him, on the ferry, what he thinks today, he sounds pessimistic, even deflated. He says: I still hope that one day we will get permission to reopen it. And he cannot resist referring to one last irony of the closure of his beloved and silent seminary. In the garden in front of the seminary there is a bust of Ataturk above a slogan attributed to the great man that reads: The main virtue in life is knowledge. His All Holiness smiles a weak smile. How ironic, he says, that this should appear at the entrance to a closed school. Vincent Boland is an Financial Times correspondent based in Ankara.

"The icon of Our Lady of Kazan, which Pope John Paul II returned to Moscow's Patriarch Alexy II last year, was turned over to the Orthodox diocese of Kazan in the Russian Republic of Tatarstan. Taken from its original home 101 years ago, the icon represents one of the most revered devotions in Russian Orthodoxy. Although Patriarch Alexy belittled the pope's gesture and referred to the icon as not the 16th century original but only a copy, he led an elaborate ceremony which took the icon to the monastery of the Mother of God, its original home, currently undergoing restoration after being used as a tobacco factory in the Soviet period. The local Roman Catholic parish priest attended the ceremony, as did Muslim representatives and the president of Tatarstan, half of whose population is Muslim. Patriarch Alexy used the occasion of his homily to promote Muslim-Christian dialogue. Orthodox-Roman Catholic dialogue is still stalled on the issue of the Orthodox suspicion of Roman Catholic conversions on Russian soil.

"Some of the leading Turkish writers, Mehmet Ali Birand among them, give credit to the Turkish government for what they call waking up. What Birand et al and other deniers are stating is that, after many years of not responding to the Genocide commentaries by those espousing the genocide against Armenians, finally the Turkish government and its hacks are doing something about it. It boggles my mind that anyone really believes that the governments of Turkey had been passively sitting back and had handed the issue to the Armenians. But so it goes in the captive minds, even if it does not make sense. NEED FOR NEW THINKING But if Turkey is really awake, they must go beyond the Genocide issue. Even PM Erdogan is caught up in the thinking handed to them by Ataturk; that everything the Turkish government does is good and must be accepted by others. Recently, the PM made the comment that if there is any delay in discussions about Turkey entering the European Union, it is not the fault of Turkey. Now, pray tell, when has anything ever been the fault of the Turks? He also stated that the EU should not expect Turkey to wait forever and that the citizens' patience in his country has limits. I have stated on numerous occasions, written and otherwise, that for Turkey to awaken out of their years of stagnation and authoritarian rule, they must have a cultural renaissance and, at the same time, realistically move to democracy. The renaissance and democracy go hand in glove. Both can be accomplished at the same time. Some friends disagree and maintain that the renaissance must come first. Others say that it cannot happen unless democracy is first attained. This is similar to the egg or chicken argument; you make the choice. IS EUROPEAN UNION ASLEEP? Let us take a look at how awake Turkey has become. By the way, just because one is awake does not mean another is asleep. But the Turks, in their years of authoritarian slumber, seem to think that the European Union is asleep. I wrote an article on the trials of Hrant Dink and Seyhmus Ulek for insulting Turks. The asinine charges are a clear indication that Turkey remains in deep freeze. Of course, when the EU reacts against the backsliding away from democracy, Ankara will cry foul. Surrogates for Turkey will say that the Christians in the EU Want to keep Muslim Turks out. Even if that were the case, Turkey has given what, if any, bigots there are in the European leadership positions ample proof that, as situated, Turkey should not belong in the EU. But the Turks have ten to fifteen years to transform into a state fit to sit with democracies in Europe. This means that idiotic laws such as prohibitions about insulting Turks, the government, the military, Ataturk, etc. have to go. MT. ARARAT IN ARMENIA? Recently, Armenia applied to Turkey for permission to send its Ararat Brandy there to sell. The request was turned down for a reason that helps to point out the deep freeze in which Turkey remains. They object to the likeness of Mt. Ararat being on the label of the brandy, because Turks might believe that it is in Armenia. The more likely reason is that the Turks object to Ararat being a symbol for Armenia and Armenians. There remains the fear that Armenia continues to have designs on the territory that was handed to Turkey by Lenin and Stalin. Further, the Turks have not recovered from Atom Egoyan's movie Ararat making the rounds of the free states in the world (it was barred in Turkey) and now available for viewing on most TV stations (at least in the U.S.) that carry movie channels. Perhaps the greatest indication that Turkey is asleep is Ankara's message that the Turkish general staff really did not get out of politics and lawmaking in the society. Recall that one of the major criticisms of the European Union was that the uniformed leaders in Turkey interfered in the society where, in democratic states, the elected officials hold reign. Supposedly, the change in the constitution in 2004 got the generals out of civil decision-making. Because the EU was still examining Turkey's worth to begin discussions on Turkey's entry into the EU, the generals actually kept a low profile in civil matters. SKEPTICISM REMAINS IN EUROPE But the experienced members of the European Union remain skeptical and are of the opinion that time will tell if the changes are meaningful. The pols in Europe that have experience with the Turks fully understand that what they pass as laws and what they practice are two very distinct and different things. Like Missourians that are a Show me people, the wise European leaders insist that Turkey talk less and show more. Crying about being poor ole Turks that are picked on by the Christian West will go only so far. But Turkey thinks that the Europeans, and not Ankara, are asleep. A supposed learned journalist such as Mr. Birand also indicates that he probably swallowed a bunch of sleeping pills, but has been dreaming that Turkey has finally awakened. In April the Turkish generals jumped into the open with flags waving and trumpets calling the charge. EU pols smiled as the generals charged into the valley mapped out by EU pols who do not want Turkey in their club. This is not an Islam thing; it is an unwise political blunder brought on by the Turks that reveals that very little change has taken place in Turkey below the veneer. The blunder shows that the generals still can run the show when they wish. This is a fact that does not sit well with the Europeans. In a speech in mid-April, Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, Chief of the General Staff, alleged that the US is tolerant of Kurdish terrorists and rebels in northern Iraq. The Turks have coveted Kirkuk and Mosul forever. This region has oil reserves second only to Saudi Arabia. The Turks would like the area in friendly hands so that a bridge is built between Turkey and northern Iraq like a Turkish highway. If that happened, it would not be long before Turkey would be demanding that the U.S. pay for a pipeline that extended from the region to its port at Ceyhan. Until the pipeline is constructed, the Turkish oil trucks would wear the land away driving between the Kirkuk area and Mosul. OTHER DEMANDS The general also demanded something from Armenia if they wanted friendly relations with the border open: get out of Karabagh and the surrounding areas and stop instigating for genocide recognition. In other words, Armenia, run up the white flag. Finally, the general stated something about Cyprus. He stated that Turkish troops would not be withdrawn. In countries with civilian control of the government, these kinds of judgments are left to the elected officials. Just imagine what would happen if a U.S. suddenly announced that U.S. troops would not be withdrawn from Iraq. It would not be long before the general were drawing retired pay and looking to see what other promised benefit would be sliced from the retired military. Many people dream they are awake and that they are actually doing a life-like act. This is what has happened in Turkey. They are frozen in sleep and do not know it.

"The members of ecumenical committees of the Catholicosate of Cilicia's various Dioceses participated in a one-day conference in Bikfaya on August 18, 2005. The conference was organized by the ecumenical relations committee of the Catholicosate of Cilicia under the patronage of His Holiness Aram I. Around 50 young men and women, who participate in several ecumenical conferences and meetings by decision of their dioceses or the Catholicosate of Cilicia, participated in the conference from the various dioceses in the Middle East. Bishop Nareg Alemezian, director of the Catholicosate's ecumenical department, delivered the opening remarks and welcomed the participants. His Holiness then delivered his message to the participants, emphasizing the Catholicosate of Cilicia's insistence on delegating highly qualified participants to ecumenical conferences and meetings. This is what has imposed respect towards our church and our seat in general. Compared to others, we are a small church, but with our continuous and high-quality participation in ecumenical activities, we have made an important contribution to the movement's mission and work, said His Holiness Aram I. Nora Kabakian, the chairwoman of the committee, welcomed the participants and called on them to make the conference a success through their participation, exchange of views and experiences. She stressed the importance of professionalism and self-preparation for a useful participation in ecumenical conferences. Bishop Alemezian then delivered a lecture on The Catholicosate of Cilicia and the Ecumenical Movement. He pointed out that different approaches should be adopted with respect to involvement in the ecumenical movement on local, regional and international levels. Participants from different dioceses talked about the conferences they have attended during the last year and shared their experiences. Teni Pirri Simonian, director of the World Council of Churches' (WCC) department for Church and Ecumenical Relations, then talked about the challenges the WCC faces and the 9th Assembly of the council, to be held next year in Brazil. Seta Khedeshian then talked about the Middle East Council of Churches and the challenges it faces and Dr. Jan Salmanian delivered a lecture about the Christian-Muslim dialogue process and its current developmental phases. Participants in the conference were given the chance to ask questions and express viewpoints after each lecture. They later discussed the main viewpoints expressed during the different sessions. Bishop Alemezian praised the attendants and the level of their participation at the end of the conference.

"Q: What is your assessment of the relations among the three principal opposition parties - the People's Party headed by Stepan Demirjian, Aram Sargisian's Republican Party, and yours - and to what extent have you created a field of harmonious cooperation? A: I wish to make one thing clear: presently, it is not just the political parties which are in opposition to the authorities. Today, the entire population is opposed to the authorities. And, if we want to be more precise, today it is the authorities, which are in opposition to the people, in Armenia and Artsakh as well as the Diaspora. Those authorities are the adversaries, who are inimically disposed towards their own people. All the political parties in opposition and, generally speaking, all the sound political parties, in Armenia have put one issue before themselves: the establishment of democracy in Armenia; the supremacy of rights, which will be nailed down, for sure, through laws; putting an end to bribery and the corruption that is devouring the corpus of the state. It is these fundamental issues, which are impeding the development of the Republic of Armenia. And these are the fundamental, pivotal issues that have brought both the political parties and the people together. If together we are able to shake off the yoke of these anti-Armenian, anti-popular authorities, believe me, the collective decision of the people, reached through free and fair elections, will be the most powerful, the most correct one. Since 1995, not a single election, be it presidential or parliamentary, has been untainted and fair, conducted in a free, transparent democratic environment. The authorities have constantly tampered with the expression of the popular free will. Furthermore, we have constantly had men at the helm of leadership, who have not been elected; men, who have simply usurped the levers of authority through bribery, election fraud and perversion of election results. Like a band of criminals in cahoots with each other, they know that, if the will of the people should triumph, numerous questions will undoubtedly be raised. Thus, big businessmen don't contribute a penny to the state budget, yet every three months they get a new Bentley or Rolls Royce worth half a million dollars. How is it that their assistants or administrative staff members, men whose neck size is larger than their brains, are driving around in a dozen or so expensive Jeeps? ... They are spreading fright and terror everywhere. Naturally, the authorities in power are not able to give the answers to all those questions. Meanwhile, the answers to all those questions are precisely spelled out in the criminal code. If we can establish the supremacy of law, the supremacy of right, I can say with conviction that Armenia shall enter a new stage of development. Q: Recently, changes to the Armenian Constitution were approved. What was the reaction to this? A: I wish to briefly review the story of these changes. Six months ago, the National Accord Party and the Justice Alliance came out with a joint announcement, in which they indicated the three main questions of principle; in the event of their employment - reference is to constitutional change - without fail, we shall not only participate in the discussion thereof in the National Assembly but also engage in explanatory effort among the masses to the widest extent possible, in order to give them life. The authorities rejected them right from the start. Furthermore, they let loose a string of insults and contemptuous remarks against the opposition through the print media and television stations benefiting from and being nourished by said authorities, saying that the opposition wishes to approve constitutional changes that will end in chaos. In the very month of June, during the session of the parliamentary congress of the European Union, to which I too am a delegate, when the issue of constitutional changes in the Republic of Armenia came up on the agenda, it was directly noted in the resolution there, that all the proposals of the opposition political forces of the Republic of Armenia are in accord with the proposals of the Venice Commission. The Venice Commission is the commission of experts of the European Union, whose assurances pertaining to constitutional changes are practically obligatory and unconditional on the 46 member countries of the European Union. That very same resolution exhorted the opposition to return to the National Assembly without fail and help to bring about the constitutional changes, to which we were partisan from the start. We advised and prompted the authorities to take the route that we were indicating. It was as if the authorities were behaving perversely, having put both their feet in one shoe, and saying no. Meanwhile, when the European Union made it obligatory, they agreed and submitted, like a child, like a little boy having engaged in mischief. I am not at all contented by the fact that, in this instance, they (the authorities) yielded to force, instead of complying with reason. For us Armenians that is not at all a satisfactory manifestation. First and foremost, we have put at the head of the question that we are partisan to such constitutional changes, whereby balance is created between the executive and legislative authorities, by law, through the constitution. As it as, doesn't the presidential institute resemble an Asiatic kingdom? The second most important question and issue is that the judicial authorities must operate absolutely independent of both presidential and legislative authority, that they be subjected only to constitutional demands and the demands of law. The third is that we have elected, not appointed, officials in the various communities. Reference is to the capital city of Yerevan. As you know, it has been 15 years already since the mayoralty has been an appointive position. As a result, the center of the city is getting uglier by the day; the jewels that the architectural monuments built by [Alexander] Tamanian represent are being desecrated with the opening of various commercial sites; The marvelous large grove around the opera building is almost entirely devoid of a green zone. I'll not even speak about the tasteless buildings, which are being built in the most irregular manner, particularly in the central areas of Yerevan. Now, if the mayor of Yerevan were to be accountable to the voters, as opposed to President Kocharian, who appointed him, he would have a different attitude toward the capital city of Yerevan. Instead of extending his term in office by lavishing words of praise upon Kocharian, he should be elected by winning the hearts of the Yerevanites. The Yerevanites should feel that they are landlords in their hometown, not tenants. Q: Are you preparing to again enter your candidacy in the 2008 presidential elections? A: If there is anticipation here in America for the 2008 election, we are anticipating presidential elections much sooner in Armenia. Q: Which role are you expecting to play in the special presidential elections or those that shall take place otherwise? A: It is not important if we replace Kocharian with Geghamian or not. It's a matter of us being able to return the Republic of Armenia to the point where it can develop constitutionally, as opposed to instituting such a system, where an individual has a role to play, of course - I'm referring to the president - but he should be limited in his operations, according to the working constitution and the working laws. My aim is to support the formation of such a system in all ways possible. In the event of the formation of such a system, we will have a republic of which we have dreamed, at least for me. The matter of who the president is should not be given any importance whatsoever; rather, the paramount question is, are the people, the fatherland being defended by laws under the given president? In the name of the government, do people have a vital positive force that inspires pride, conviction and faith among the citizenry toward a bright future? Three years ago, a session of this same parliamentary congress was held in Rotterdam. I asked the members of the delegation from Holland, what is the reason for Holland having such a high standard of living? They replied that this was conditioned by the fact that the Dutch people do not know who their prime minister is. It seems that they gave an absurd answer but when you dig deeper into the answer, you see many profound and hopeful things, because their people are protected by law. They find out about a change in prime minister at precisely the time when the laws are being broken; this means that they are aware that everything is not normal in the high echelons of government. This is the kind of country I wish to see in the name of our beloved Armenia, not an eloquent or a taciturn president, who, besides speaking, doesn't do anything at all to lighten the people's daily burdens, which, I assure you, are the principal cause of the continuing emigration which we have been witnessing since 1992. Q: What change would you like to see in the position of president? A: First, let me say that, by the standards of the presidential institute in today's Republic of Armenia, we have hundreds of candidates, who can be of much more active benefit to the Republic of Armenia, in terms of their intellectual capabilities and honesty. Now if we are to judge on the basis of pan-European or international standards, then today, more than ever, it is a requirement that the authorities of the Republic of Armenia, whether it is the president, the chairman of the National Assembly, or the prime minister, must be very well versed in, and be in full command of, all the political developments occurring in the world. They must have studied in depth the meaning of globalization and know what challenges stemming from it shall face the world and specifically the little countries, like Armenia. They must be eminently cognizant of possible regional developments: What will the status of Georgia, Azerbaijan or Turkey be in 2020? What will be the status of Iran and Russia? What possible advantages will be created by the U.S., Russia and the European Union? And, after making all those forecasts, they must sit down and think of which route the Republic of Armenia must take in its development, given this or that state of affairs. They must think in terms of Armenia being able to harmoniously build its future, not on contradictions, but on generalities, which perhaps aren't noticeable today in such depth but which shall propel Armenia from the radius of that development. Today, aside from circumstantial solutions, the Armenian authorities are not able to give an answer to a single question. I regret to say that their mental aptitudes are not even on the level of a schoolboy. Owing to their conceit, they can never ever become set free from their torpor, because they are not surrounded by the likes of [Pariur] Sevak, Silva Kaputikian, Aram Khachaturian, Victor Hambardzumian - I'm referring to our contemporaries; rather, they are surrounded by individuals with various semi-criminal nicknames, whose education has been limited to the second grade. Under this circumstance, the authorities naturally are not able to lead our country, because individuals with high mental capacities are needed for that. The supremacy of spiritual values, as opposed to material, has been, is and shall continue to be of primary importance. Nothing will change if this value system is not put in order and until we Armenians return to the proper course of our national development, by giving primary importance to the culture and science stemming from our very own history, as well as the traditions pertaining to our daily life. We should ask ourselves, how is it that Assyria, Babylon, the Roman Empire and Byzantium, and the Arab caliphates, all of which were contemporaries of ancient and medieval Armenia, no longer exist; that the ill-starred Ottoman Empire has likewise become part of history, but the Armenians, whose history goes back 3,000 years, continue to live on the edges of biblical Mt. Ararat? Providence has played a role in Armenia and the life of us Armenians, for otherwise we too would have become part of history. Until we understand that, until we are conscious thereof, we will not be able to perceive the future, I assure you. Today, by not accepting dual citizenship, we are telling approximately nine million Armenian people that we have cut their umbilical chord to Mother Armenia. Two and a half million, or, at most, three million Armenians remain in Armenia. By cutting their umbilical chord, we are artificially depriving Diasporan Armenians who possess huge intellectual and economic power. Thus, if we approach the election of the future president with such standards, the womb of the Armenian soil will not dry up. Q: How do you view the contribution of our traditional political parties with a century of experience to the internal political life of Armenia on a still larger scale? Our three political parties are the center of the authoritative political power of more than six million of those nine million Diasporan Armenians you speak of. A: I am of the opinion that this loss is all our loss; namely, the traditional parties, which have their subdivisions in Armenia, cannot fully utilize that huge power that exists, particularly in this instance, within the Democratic Liberal [Ramkavar] Party. Because I know enlightened minds in the ranks of the Ramkavars, who can help not only the Democratic Liberal Party of Armenia but also the Armenian people as a whole with their intellectual capabilities. I think that the traditional political parties and we too have much to do in this regard. Here's where I see it evolving: taking advantage of the friendly attitude, which has been established particularly between the American wing of the Democratic liberal Party and the National Accord, I should endeavor to anticipate the employment of your party's intellectual capabilities in the life of Armenia. There are certain issues to be broached, specifically connected to the Armenian people, the Diasporan Armenians, which we should approach in a more professional manner. It is unlikely that just one political party or political force may support and assist us Armenians of Armenia. Furthermore, the Ramkavars, over the course of a century, have been able to prove that it is secondary for them as to who is in power; foremost for them are the Republic of Armenia, the Armenian people, and the land of the Armenians. This is the example that must be a guide for all of us. Political parties come and go from the political arena but the fatherland is a permanent value, which we must cherish, like the light of our eyes, and not try to tear it to pieces by each of us pulling his separate way. We are one nation, one culture, we have one destiny; therefore, all of us must take charge of that destiny. Because today if a child is sick and if we know a doctor but that doctor is not a rank-and-file member of the parties in power, that doesn't mean that we must prevent treatment. Today's reality is reminiscent of that It is foreign and unacceptable to me that a reasonable proposal, a sensible approach from each political group, which is out of power, is received with jealousy. That must not be compatible with a small country like ours. We must give value to each statement, particularly the words of those individuals, the words of those political parties, which have a century-long history. It means that the political parties have had such potentiality and such a philosophy of life that they have been able to maintain the most important thing - their Armenianness, their devotion to Armenia - at these crossroads of history, under the most diverse societal conditions. I think that it is an unforgivable act of negligence on the part of both the authorities and the forces making up that ruling coalition, when they cannot utilize that potentiality. And this applies, generally speaking, to the Democratic Liberal Party. Q: Mr. Geghamian, it became evident that revolutions of various hues can occur in the former Soviet republics, with the interference, of course, of the United States. Is such a rapid change of power envisioned in Armenia? A: Dear unger Vartivarian, let's mentally ask these questions: Were fewer people present in Freedom Square, in the square near the Matenadaran in 2003 than in Tbilisi or Kiev? Of course not. Furthermore, did a fewer number of people assemble in April 2004? Of course not. Moreover, the more you delve into the reality, the more you go back to the United States, to the well-known meeting between Haydar Aliyev and Robert Kocharian in Key West in 2001, with the participation of Colin Powell, in whose final phase President George Bush, Jr. also took part. Bush told Secretary of State Powell that he would participate only in the event that the two sides already reached a certain agreement And the two sides had reached a certain agreement The principles had been formulated, by which the Karabagh conflict would be resolved. However, following this conference, the leaders of both sides had appealed to the United States, France and Russia - I'm referring to the co-presidents of the Minsk Group - and beseeched them, saying, if we suddenly return to our respective countries, Azerbaijan and Armenia, with these proposals, the people won't accept them and we will lose in the upcoming presidential elections. Thus, America, France and Russia were obliged to begin the entire negotiation process from scratch. From a blank white page. That was the reason why they tolerated the disgraceful elections of 2003 yet they did so nevertheless. The US State Department's evaluations [of those elections] were critical, with the use of very balanced and coarse language; so were' those of France. And neither President Bush nor President Jacques Chirac sent messages of congratulations per se. As it was, they had again come to a certain understanding in Warsaw; Aliyev and Kocharian had come to an understanding. According to the Russian-language Nezavisimaya Gazeta's issue of the next-to-the-last Friday in June, Mammedarov said that the agreement was a sensation in the relations between these two countries. As it was, a completely new state of affairs was created. In this instance, starting a revolution in Armenia would have been a fatal mistake, because Mr. Kocharian would then say that the opposition weakened the authorities internally and unfavorable agreements were imposed on them in a weakened state. In other words, he would attempt to ascribe the failures of his own foreign policy to the opposing political forces. Q: The Armenians have cultivated a relationship with Russia for more than two hundred years. It will be very difficult to shake that off at this stage in that part of the world. A: You're correct. The beginning of Russian-Armenian relations dates back to the well-known treaty of 1827, and now that relationship is almost two hundred years old. You are very well aware of Armenia's geographical position, particularly in terms of our neighbors to the east and south. We don't have a direct border with Russia. Without fail, we must take into account the military-political alliances of those countries. Today, the construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan and Baku-Tbilisi-Erzerum oil and gas pipelines has made Georgia, Azerbaijan and Turkey fast friends, economically speaking. Going one step further, at present, Georgia's national budget is enhanced by an annual net income of $850,000,000 from the transport of oil and gas alone. In other words, progress in Georgia is totally conditioned by Azeri oil and gas. Naturally, both the Azeris and the Turks are aware of that. And, with them having such powerful levers of economic impact, I can say with conviction, that economic alliance will be parlayed into a military-political alliance. We must have such an alliance in mind and know that, one day, just as Turkey is presently blockading the Republic of Armenia, perhaps tomorrow or the next day, Georgia could employ a false pretext to do almost the same thing, by raising the duty on the transportation of freight to such a high level that life in Armenia would become even more expensive. On the other hand, we must take into account the present state of affairs in Iran, now that a more radical and conservative Muslim has become president, and we know the attitude of the US toward Iran. For better or worse, there remains the Russian Federation, with whom the Republic of Armenia presently has a collective security treaty. Today we are protected by that. The strategic treaty we have is with one country, Russia, which is conscious of that, so the possibilities of her exerting pressures are great - something which is impermissible. Therefore, Armenia must also seek cooperation, for the sake of peace, within the NATO structure; she must deepen that cooperation to bring about a new qualitative level, so that, tomorrow or the next day, our friendly neighbor to the north will know that if she attempts to interfere with Armenia's policy to an intolerable degree and, furthermore, attempts to apply pressure, Armenia always has an alternative path, which is precisely the one I have spoken of. We must utilize the interests of Russia, the United States and the European Union in our region for the benefit of the Republic of Armenia. What is the general interest? It is being their ally in the struggle against terrorism. Now terrorism can also arise in the southern Caucasus, this center of Muslim and Christian civilizations; it is possible for many serious developments to originate here. Q: When conditions for a truly democratic society are created in Armenia, do you think that our fatherland can benefit from our Diasporan economic forces? A: I am convinced of that. You won't find any truly democratic country in the world that is in a state of isolation, whose security is a question mark. There are numerous examples. The superpowers assist those countries, which have chosen the path to democracy. In particular, if Armenia becomes an island of democracy in the southern Caucasus region, then it will be in the vital interests of the United States for Iran's neighbor, the Republic of Armenia, to experience an indescribable advancement owing to the development of its democratic institutions. In this way, it will be possible to show those very same Iranians that if they choose a similar path, they will live a much better life than they do presently, considering the wealth of natural resources that exist underground. Q: What do you have to say about freedom of the press in Armenia? A: While there is freedom of the press in the print media, it is absolutely nonexistent in television I'll cite one example and leave it at that. I have had six public appearances in the past year - four of them at the parliamentary congress of the European Union in Strasbourg, two at the European Union. In all of them, I expressed thoughts that reflected a patriotic spirit, to such an extent that the Turkish and Azeri press immediately reported them. However, not a single television station in Armenia did the same. What is this, if not a case of curbing freedom of the press?

"Dr. Iain Torrance: Haigazian University was a creative response to the Armenian Genocide. The Orphan's Fair, which was organized in April by the University's humanitarian club, illustrates your practical investment in the future. It attests to the founding charisma of the University, said Dr. Iain Torrance, president of Princeton Theological Seminary, to the graduating class of 2005. Dr. Torrance was the guest speaker at the Baccalaureate Service of Haigazian University, which took place on Sunday, June 26, 2005, in the First Armenian Evangelical Church in Beirut. A large number of graduates and their families participated in this ceremony, a service of dedication for the graduating class of 2005 and thanksgiving for fifty years of service of Haigazian University. This was the opening event of a week of celebrations of the 50th anniversary of the University. The graduating class walked through the church sanctuary during the processional hymn. The service began with a call to worship by Rev. Nishan Bakalian, the campus minister, followed by a hymn of praise, For the Beauty of the Earth. Afterwards, the President of the Supreme Council of the Evangelical Community in Syria and Lebanon, Rev. Dr. Salim Sahyouni, offered the prayer of invocation. President of Haigazian University, Rev. Dr. Paul Haidostian, welcomed the audience, among whom were the Arab Team of Christian-Muslim Dialogue, dignitaries of the community, and dozens of guests from overseas. Haidostian summarized his feelings and thoughts, stating that there is no noble feeling greater than that of a grateful heart, and there is no stronger human power than that of dedication. He added, There is no more proper address for gratitude than that of God Almighty, and there is no more relevant dedication than that to serve. Several graduates took part in the service. Ms. Hera Sagherian, Mr. Elias Ousta Jabbour, Ms. Anni Balabanian, and Ms. Taline Avakian read biblical selections. Following the choir's rendering of John Rutter's I Will Sing with the Spirit, Ms. Riham Jarjour and Mr. Raffee Parseghian shared their reflections through a multi-media presentation on how Haigazian University affected their lives positively, and helped them change to the better. This year's litany of thanksgiving had been specially written for the occasion, and representatives of all the stakeholders at Haigazian University took part: a Board member, a parent, a faculty member, two students, and a member of the staff. Hope in the New World was the theme of the message of the day, delivered by Dr. Torrance. As president of Princeton Theological Seminary, he noted with excitement that Dr. John Markarian, founding President of Haigazian University, as well as the current president, Rev. Dr. Paul Haidostian, were alumni of Princeton, adding that he was honored to preach on such an occasion and to underscore the ties of friendship between the two institutions. Dr. Torrance tackled the theme of creative response and healing, stating that the conception of Haigazian University was the creative response to the Armenian Genocide. Additionally, he remembered the events of February and March of this year, and concluded, Lebanon now stands at the threshold of a new stage in its history. A prayer of dedication by the Vice-Chairman of Haigazian University's Board of Trustees, Rev. Robert Sarkissian, followed, after which Mr. Hovig Assilian and Miss Grace Bou Daher read the pledges of the graduates to carry the light of truth, freedom and service to the world: We, the class of 2005 of Haigazian University, in receiving this light, pledge to hold high the light of truth, to defend the light of freedom, and to spread the light of service to our communities, our country and our world. While the graduates shared the flame among fellow classmates, the President of the Union of the Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East, Rev, Megrdich Karagoezian, pronounced the benediction, whereupon the class of 2005 marched out of the sanctuary with the recessional, each carrying the light out into the world. Highly emotional moments indeed! No doubt that the jubilee graduates have been well armed to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.

"If you have ever sympathized with the IRA's armed struggle in Northern Ireland, than you are not very different from the extremist Muslims all over the world who have expressed sympathy for the suicide bombers who recently terrorized London. That is what some commentators are now starting to say, given the extraordinary events of this summer. It was on July 7, and then exactly two weeks later, that jihad struck London's transportation system. Inevitably it was noted that British authorities had much experience with IRA terror attacks. Then, a couple of weeks ago, the IRA announced that it was abandoning the armed struggle and would begin destroying its weapons. Of course, in the days which followed, many people looked at the IRA's peace move with optimism, saying that it proved that even the most determined foe could eventually renounce terror. But some commentators also chose to use the IRA's past base of support in the U.S. to suggest that maybe the mindset of a terrorist - even those born outside of the nation for which they fight - should not be so incomprehensible. We did, after all, once tolerate a similar phenomenon ourselves, Anne Applebaum wrote this week in The Washington Post. I am talking about the sympathy for the IRA that persisted for decades in some Irish American communities and is only now fading away. Applebaum adds, The range of Americans who were unbothered by (IRA violence) was surprisingly wide... you don't have to be Muslim, or poor, or an extremist, to feel the romantic pull of terrorism. You can be a middle-class American and a lapsed Catholic whose grandmother happened to come from Donegal. There are many holes Applebaum's argument. For example, say what you will about the Irish American Republican movement, but they do have a clear goal - a united, peaceful Ireland. On the other hand, those who claim to understand what is fueling al-Qaeda and its disparate cells are few and far between. Even America-haters don't quite know what bin Laden wants, short of Israel's demise and a global Muslim brotherhood. Still, it does need to be pointed out that Irish American support for armed struggle and Catholic civil rights was always riddled with inconsistencies. Members of the World War II generation might have had their lives saved in the European theater by a British soldier, only, 20 or so years later, to hope the Brit's head would be blown off. Big city Irish American cops might have cursed the dastardly police brutality of their Belfast counterparts during civil rights marches, yet looked the other way when things got ugly at marches all across the U.S. throughout the 1960s and 1970s. I don't claim to speak for every Irish American from Boston to New York to Chicago. Let's just say this - their concern for human rights is sometimes restricted to the boundaries of Ulster. That all being said, will we really, 50 years from now, look upon the IRA's supporters with the same loathing which we reserved for bin Laden and his ilk? Not likely. Aside from clearly defined goals, the Republican movement also had a cooperative enemy in the often brutal British security forces who time and time again abused their power. Even enemies of the armed struggle would often concede they understood where an IRA soldier's rage came from. These days, yes, American support for IRA violence is scant, but there does remain great concern that Catholics be treated justly and fairly in the North. Those concerns, however, raise the same old questions. British security forces blatantly targeted Catholics. Today we call that profiling. Do we say, well, it's only right. They are the ones with all the bombs, aren't they? To an Irish Catholic taking the New York City subway, profiling may sound rational. That's harder to say if the train is traveling a Belfast route, isn't it? I'm just asking. And so, we are left with the suggestion that the IRA's new course shows that terrorism can be defeated as Elizabeth Sullivan's Cleveland Plain-Dealer column recently put it. Perhaps. So, 90 years, or a couple of centuries from now, we can look forward to jihadists announcing that, after tens of thousands of deaths, they are finally planning to decommission? Again, I'm just asking. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Aftermath of IRA bomb at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England in 1984)","Deignan, Tom",Irish Voice,2005-08-10,1
"Throughout human history, taxes and tax collectors have always had a bad odor. Witness the low esteem that tax collectors enjoyed at the time of Jesus, 2000 years ago. The gospels lump tax collectors with robbers, sinners and pagans; otherwise, how to explain the great surprise of the Jews at that time, when Jesus mixed and ate with tax collectors. (See Gospel according to Matthew, 9:10; and according to Luke 18:9 and 19:2). Western type of direct taxation has almost always been, and is also at present, ill suited for underdeveloped and developing countries. Anyone who has lived and worked in the Middle Eastern countries knows this fact quite well. The author of this book, Levon Vartan (Bedirian), was well known to the Armenian community of Syria and Lebanon as a writer, poet, historian and lecturer of history and literature at Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) schools, Armenian Evangelical College, professor at Haigazian College, at Husisian Armenological Institute and in the Armenological section of Jesuit Fathers' St. Joseph University in Beirut. He was born in Aleppo, graduated from Aleppo College and took his B.A and M.A degrees from the American University of Beirut. On a personal note, he was a lifelong friend of mine ever since high school days. The main focus of Vartan's historical writings comprises Turkish-Armenian relations, especially the Genocide of 1915-1918. Thus he has published - all in Armenian - the following volumes, The Armenian Fifteen and Armenians' Abandoned Properties (1970) [Armenian Fifteen stands for the Genocide of 1915 - S.K.]; A Chronology of Armenian Fifteen, 1915-23 (1975). This is a unique work, as no other work exists in Armenian or any foreign language, giving the chronology of the Genocide, with a time-line of current events during World War I. The interested reader may read my review of this book in Nor Or Armenian weekly, April 22, 1980, or in The Armenian Observer March 23, 1983, [The Chronology of the Armenian Genocide written by the late Haigazn Ghazarian is very deficient, thus unsatisfactory; it can be seen on the web page of the Armenian National Institute]. Other works by L. Vartan: Let the Turk Talk (1975); On the Economic Relations of Western Armenians (1977); The Armenian Fifteen in Turkish Books and the Press and We (1998). He has several other works of historical and literary interest, which have not been published. He has also translated into Armenian Khalil Jibran's The Prophet, which is not yet printed. The book under consideration in this article, The Taxes in Ottoman and Persian Empires is Vartan's last book, the first volume having been published posthumously in 2004 in Yerevan. Vartan's widow, Vehan, personally took the manuscript of this work to Armenia, where it was published by the Literature and Arts section of Yeghishe Charents Institute. I am told the second volume will soon be published and will complete the work. The first volume consists of 580 pages. It has an Introduction by Doctor/Prof. Henrik Pakhchinian, Head of the Charents Institute. The editor is Garo Aprahamian of Beirut, who also gives a nine-page-article on Levon Vartan as a historian. A fifteen-page preface by Vartan himself gives his purpose in writing this rather tedious work. The history of Armenian-Ottoman and Armenian-Turkish economic relations has not yet been written, although there are some publications dealing with this topic. However, the latter are deficient because of the lack of original data... Armenian-Ottoman economic relations have been, over several centuries, one of the fundamental causes of the genesis of the Armenian Problem. He adds, Taxes gathered legally or illegally by Ottoman government from the non-Muslim subjects have an important place in the history of economic relations. The book presents and discusses the various taxes in the Ottoman and Persian empires from 15th to the 20th centuries. The names of the taxes are given in alphabetical order, and this volume comprises letters A to I of the Armenian alphabet, starting with the tax called Akche Bashe and ending with the one called Ikramiye. About four hundred and thirty taxes are given and discussed and the appropriate references given. Sometimes one tax has existed by several names throughout centuries. As one browses through this volume, one sees that there were taxes of almost every kind; some examples, taxes for sheep, cows, buying horses for the Ottoman Army, crossing a river, passing through a narrow valley, night watchmen, the chief of the royal stables, fruit trees, vegetable farms, belonging to a trade union, weighing wholesale goods or produce, wine, silk goods, producing charcoal, etc. In addition, there were taxes from slave sellers and buyers, as well as from the slaves sold in the slave market in Istanbul, special taxes on the occasion of Moslem holidays, property taxes on homes, taxes on producers of honey, walnut trees, fishing in lakes and rivers, spices, etc. One of the worst taxes imposed on Armenians, a few months before the start of World War I, was the war tax called tekalif-i harbiye (see page 412). Every body - Moslem or non-Moslem - was supposed to pay this tax. However, it was a legal way to rob the Armenians of everything that could be carried away, like villagers' carriages and carts, horses, donkeys, cows, anything edible, like wheat, cheese, cooking fats and oils, and even clothing. All these were supposedly collected for the war effort. Actually it was nothing but highway robbery, leaving the Christian minorities without the most basic necessities of daily life. The majority of the taxes in this book are from the Ottoman rule. In doing this research' work, the author has drawn on various sources in Armenian, Turkish, French and English. The author explains the taxation system in the Ottoman Empire (this was probably also true for the Persian Empire). According to traditional Islamic law, taxes were divided into two categories: those having the sanctions of the Sacred Law, called tekialif sher'i, and taxes by monarchical authority called tekialif eorfi, created by Sultan's order in case of need. Although most taxes were paid by all subjects, according to the Sacred Law, the Christians were subjected to two special taxes: the cizya, a tribute or poll tax, and the haraj, or land tax. Most Moslems were liable to be enrolled in the army, while the Christians were obliged to pay an annual tax, called bedel askeri, which exempted them from military service, and which was incident at birth. As Lynch observed some hundred years ago, It is probable that Christians evade the (official) census to a greater extent than their Mohammedan neighbors; for the budget of a Christian family is immediately menaced by the birth of a male child. As mentioned, there were numerous taxes in the Ottoman Empire. But the main problems created by the taxes were the way they were collected, as the author states on page 28. The policy of tax farming [called iltizam] was the most susceptible to abuse and mismanagement, resulting from complete lack of law enforcement and elementary justice in the provinces. It was based on an auction of the right to collect taxes from a specific portion of the sultan's property. The official policy of the Ottoman government was to pass the responsibility of tax collection to certain officials, who purchased the right to collect for the government. In theory, whoever offered the highest sum to the treasury was awarded the concession. From that point on, how they collected and to what extent they collected was their business, since the government had already received its share from the officials. When contractor collected the tax from the farmer, he could always raise the assessed valuation to any point he wanted and the Armenian taxpayer had to pay. The tax collector had the right to get government military officials to enforce the amount required. I may add that the term tax farming, used by writers in English, does not seem to be correct, because it implies that the business was only agricultural. In fact, productive sources of revenue like trade monopolies on alcoholic drinks and other goods, gold mines and salt production were auctioned off to tax farmers. In addition, customs collection, a lucrative source of revenue for the government, was routinely auctioned to tax farmers. Starting in the 1870s, Sultan Hamid II decided to crush the Armenians, using another minority group, the Kurds. The Kurdish chiefs were given military rank, and their men were armed but given no pay other than the right to loot the Armenians and other minorities. Looting, of course, is not like taking a tax. However, the salaries for the Kurdish fighters were looted from the Armenians. Levon Vartan's book on Taxes in Ottoman and Persian Empires presents new data, thus making it a significant contribution in this field. This is my opinion as a layman. This work would be primarily of interest as a reference book, to those who are interested, in Armenian and Ottoman history. It is highly desirable for the library of every Armenian school - in Armenia or the Diaspora - to have a copy of this book.

"Expatriate Hellenes of Constantinople and the Ecumenical Patriarchate are waiting for Turkey's answer to the European Commission's tough letter to Ankara on the protection of rights of non-Muslim foundations and the recent decision of the Turkish Supreme Court according to which no intervention can take place in the minorities' properties. Despite the efforts Ankara is theoretically making to convince the European family that it is showing respect to the minorities and religious communities' rights, the civil services of the Turkish state are refusing to promulgate the decision of the 10th Directorate of the Supreme Court because it has not been engrossed, as high diplomatic employees of the Constantinople Consulate point out the Hellenic newspaper To Ethnos Tis Kyriakis. The political tendentiousness of this characteristic arteriosclerosis exhibited by the General Directorate of Charitable Establishments of Turkey is evident: It does not wish to promote developments that would possibly clarify the complicated property status of General Directorate of Charitable Establishments. However, adopting the rationale that the General Directorate of Charitable Establishments cannot intervene in the administration of the non-Muslim community properties as the newspaper Hurriyet has written, the Supreme Court of Turkey opened they way for expatriate Hellenes and the Ecumenical Patriarchate's properties not be considered as grey zones. According to information, in addition to the fact that the Ecumenical Patriarchate has taken recourse to the European Court of Human Rights on the issue of the operation of the Orphanage of Prigipos, further recourse will be taken if the Turkish state continues on its dilatory tactics. Besides, the General Directorate of Charitable Establishments has recently refused to permit the operation of children camps that exist on island Proti of Prigiponnisa because the competent eparch was absent and had not signed the relevant document. The tendentiousness of the tactics on behalf of this specific public service is no other than to force the Ecumenical Patriarch Vartholomew to state that children's camp in Proti belongs to the Turkish state. The same tactics was adopted by the General Directorate of Charitable Establishments in more than 1,000 estates that belong to Hellenic communities of Constantinople and the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Meanwhile, in an effort to free itself from the cross-fire of the European Commission, the Turkish journalists and men of letters in general on the tolerance it exhibits to the competent public services, Ankara has recently tabled a new draft bill in relation to the properties of minority foundations. However, since the Turkish government's new legal concoction did not clarify what would happen with the thousands of buildings the competent state services managed to sell to individuals, the European Commission rejected it on the basis of its recent letter.

"There has been a great fluster recently about Turkey joining the European Union and many people, as I do, have mixed emotions about the move. The positive side of the issue I see is that Turkey would be forced to accept the common, civilized laws of the European Community. When and if this ever takes place, our Patriarchate will be far better off than it is now, because with this comes religious tolerance and hopefully a respect for human rights. Perhaps then the long suffering Patriarchate will see an end to the last hundred years of persecution and the egregious actions of Turkey, such as the confiscation of property. In addition, Turkey will have to embrace the EU's position on Cyprus. However, on the negative side, I fear that the porous boarders of a fundamental Muslim state will open up a portal to the European Community of 70 million Muslims, not all of whom wish the best for the predominantly Christian believers of Europe. Let us not forget, for all the promises of Turkey, this country boarders fanatical Muslim states of Syria, Iraq and Iran. The prevailing thought is if a Muslim country joins the EU, Muslims worldwide will see the benefits of joining modern, civilized society. As they say, this may be a plan that looks better on paper than in practice. The terrorism and security problems must be solved before the United States can support this move.

"If you are three score and ten - age 70 - or older, it's no drive through the countryside when you look to rent a car in Ireland. A recent AARP magazine noted that car rental companies who service Ireland are getting hard-nosed about car rentals to people over 65. Countries like Morocco, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ecuador, and the Green Isle all have restrictions for senior citizens. Following up on the AARP item, I took a snap survey of car rental companies and travel agencies in Massachusetts, New York, and Ireland, and the ten that I spoke with all had restrictions based on age. Five respondents, Alliance Travel, Budget, Irish Car Rentals, Avis, and Alamo flat out do not rent cars to people 76 and over. Dooley's will rent you a car for use in Ireland if you are 70 to 75 but will surcharge you an additional 10 euros a day. The company, like the others noted above, does not rent to drivers over 75. Hertz, of all the car rental companies, seems to be the fairest within an inherently unfair system that penalizes older drivers regardless of their personal health or driving record. The general Hertz policy is that they rent without surcharge or restriction up to age 75 and for those between 75 and 80 Hertz wants letters from your doctor and insurance company attesting to your health and insurability. An Irish company, Rentacar, has similar rules as Hertz, necessitating two letters for all drivers over 75, but adds that even with the letters the rental company in Ireland could deny you a car once you land at Shannon or Dublin. However, I was told that hasn't happened in the four years they have been operating. The most restrictive car rental company is something called Sixt, which is one of three rental companies that Europe by Car uses. Sixt will rent to drivers over 70 but it adds a surcharge of 15 euros a day, a hefty penalty when so many of the others rental companies will happily rent to 70-to-75-year-old drivers. The message is two fold: If you're over 80, do some heavy investigative work to find a car to drive in Ireland, or get a chauffeur. And closely check out any age restrictions by companies here or in Ireland before you leave the states. Kerry Memorial Honors Korean War Dead - After years of effort by many, the Irish who died in the Korean conflict in the early 1950s have been recognized with a stone arch monument in Lixnaw, Co. Kerry. Attending the recent inaugural ceremonies were U.S. Ambassador James Kenny, the Korean ambassador, and a large gathering of family and relatives of the 29 Irish-born U.S. Army members and six clergy. The 29 servicemen were originally from Kerry, Limerick, Cork, Leitrim, Down, Galway, Louth, Longford, and Tipperary. Also honored were five Irish Columban priests and an Irish-born Anglican nun.

This was not a terrorist attack against the mighty and the powerful. It was not aimed at presidents or prime ministers. It was aimed at ordinary working-class Londoners, black and white, Muslim and Christian, Hindu and Jew, young and old. - Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London on the train and bus bombings in Britain's capital. It's said that being rich doesn't make people happy. But Ireland's experience (Celtic Tiger) shows that it definitely helps and quite a lot. - Professor Wil Arts, Dutch author of a recent study that depicts the Irish as among the happiest people in Europe.

We must try to change their hearts and seek to address their fears. - Cardinal Theodore McCarrick of Washington, DC. Mr. Collins, you are seven minutes late. Collins answered, You people are here 700 years, and what bloomin difference will seven minutes make.' - Michael Collins' reaction to a British civil servant in Dublin in 1922 as the British handed over power to the Irish, as reported by Sean Clancy, 104, an associate of Collins. I've been getting the distinct impression lately that Sinn Fein is simply running out of things to complain about. As the whole psychology of the party requires an air of general oppression and victimhood, they seem increasingly to be clutching at straws. - An anonymous contributor's comment appearing in the Internet blog Slugger O'Toole. The Real Thing - Summertime in Belfast's Waterfront Hall as friends, admirers, associates, and the political and academic leadership of the north gathered to pay tribute to the grandson of Irish Famine survivors. It was a day dedicated to honoring Boston's Phil Haughey as the University of Ulster recognized him with an honorary doctorate. Most people active in the greater Boston Irish community know Phil and his wife and partner, Peggy. With roots in Armagh and Cork, a Harvard education, and a successful business career, he always found time to give of his time and pocket. He worked with Boston Ireland Ventures, as a backbone of the Boston and Cambridge famine memorials, and as unstinting advocate of the Irish and Celtic studies programs at Boston College and Harvard. The Best of Boston and a model for all of us who would strive to be better people, Phil Haughey is the Real Thing! History As You Like It - Hold your hats, boys and girls. Filmmaker Oliver Stone is on the prowl and his newest history revisited project is the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I have no idea how the final cinematic Stone version of that disaster will shake out, but if his movie treatment of the assassination of President Kennedy is any indication we'll be years trying to separate Stone's chaff from reality wheat. After struggling through Stone's JFK (years after its initial release) and trying to make sense of the purported links between New Orleans' Clay Shaw, an obsessed and manic district attorney, and a sideshow freak group of alleged conspirators, I yearned for a David McCullough fix. I recall speaking with a group of my daughter's friends at her college graduation party and learning that whatever they knew or thought they knew of the days and death of John Kennedy, they viewed it unquestioningly as the truth according to Oliver Stone. To an entire generation of young people, their read on modern history came not from a text book or even an imperfect film documentary, but rather from the imagination and artful fiction of one Oliver Stone. Frightening, and yet more to come. No Heavy Lifting - Be it the Congress or the Commonwealth's Great and General Court, there is a vox pop consensus that most legislators are not overworked, that sessions are lamentably short, and that there's very little heavy lifting involved. Sometimes that's the case and at other times it's clearly, 'tis said; a base canard designed to blacken the backsides of our dedicated public servants. Whatever your feeling, I am duty-bound to report that the Dail, the Irish Parliament, adjourned on July 3 and will not report again for duty until September 28. During the recently completed legislative year, the Dail members, TDs for short, sat a total of 93 days. Enda Kenny, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, described his colleagues as staggering towards the line and cannot wait to turn their backs on Leinster House and get away from being exposed and opposed. Did You Know... that Dublin's recently renovated national GAA sports stadium, Croke Park, is named for Archbishop Thomas William Croke. The Cork-born churchman (1824-1902) served as archbishop of Cashel and was a leader in the Irish cultural revival who earned the wrath of the British for his unwavering support for the Home Rule and Land League movements. You Couldn't Make This Stuff Up - Leaders of the unrelentingly anti-Catholic Orange Order are trying to gain some traction for an idea that most observers outside the hallowed Orange Lodge halls think is muddled madness of a new dimension. The guys with the sashes and an obsession with triumphalist parades through otherwise peaceful Catholic enclaves and a frenzied need to trod the Queen's Highway, now want to make the parades a signature part of the north's tourist industry. Yes, an Orange Mardi Gras, as the Derry Journal derisively phrased it. The ad campaign could kick-off with: Coming Next at a Flashpoint Near You! Yes, indeed, the good burghers from Milwaukee, Peoria, and Boise will be delighted to be around for the inevitable sectarian clashes (with the festive water cannons and colorful plastic bullets) between the Green and the Orange. Far from fostering a holiday-like atmosphere, the parades all too often bring normal commerce and retail business to a standstill, tie up scores of police and equipment, and send off thousands of nationalists to spend their Orange-free few days in friendly retreats in Donegal, Louth, and other parade-less venues. Mardi Gras, indeed. What will the fertile minds of the bowler boys think of next? In case you missed it, the European Court of Human Rights has agreed to investigate possible collusion between British agents and loyalist paramilitaries in the 1974 bombings in Dublin and Monaghan.

Former president Mary Robinson was a close second, swimmer Michelle DeBruin came in third. Others in the top ten included St. Brigid and pirate queen Grace O'Malley. The Irish are marrying even later than they once did. The average age for bridegrooms in 2002 (the last year for which statistics are available) was 32.5 years, over two years older than in 1996. Brides came in at 30.4 years, also two years older than in 1996, when it was 28.4. Galway, which is still trying to get its act together in Eyre Square, is looking to promote the city as a training gateway for the 2012 London Olympics. In most Olympics there are base camps located a distance from the Games site where athletes can train away from the hype and media. With New England waters only recently free of the Red Tide that crippled the local shell fish industry, it is sadly coincidental to learn that the same algae bloom has shown up along the western Ireland seaboard. Reports earlier last month pinpointed waters off Donegal, including Killybegs and off Killary Harbor, Galway. The previous serious case of Red Tide in Irish waters was in 1995. Galway Election Has Boston Ties - In the annual June round-robin of elections of local councillors and mayors, there was one in Galway that had a particular resonance for Bostonians of a certain age. The newly elected mayor of Galway County is one Pat Hynes. Hynes, from Kilnadeema, is a cousin of the Boston Hynes family whose most famous member was John B. Hynes (1898-1970) who beat James Michael Curley three times and served as Boston's mayor from the late forties through 1959. The Hynes family includes local TV newsman and anchor Jack and innovative educational entrepreneur Barry. An interesting sidelight to the fierce electoral battles of Hynes and Curley is that both men were sons of Galway. John B. Hynes was an East Galway man while Curley's people were from Oughterard in Connemara. Article copyright Boston Neighborhood News, Inc.","O'Donnell, Bill",The Boston Irish Reporter,2005-08-01,1
"THE scenes from London last week where a young Brazilian emigrant was executed on a subway train were truly chilling. They were also reminiscent of some of the worse excesses of the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Here was a young man who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, shot dead because he was leaving a house under surveillance by London police. The fact that the police were plain clothed when they challenged him no doubt added to the young man's terror as he did not have any idea who was chasing him, waving guns. He leaped on board a train in the station, stumbled and fell and then was shot five times in the head by one of the officers. Much of the populace, badly scarred by the recent events, originally appeared to agree with the tactic. The Sun newspaper the following morning headlined the killing and stated One Down Three to Go, as if the man had been definitely identified as one of the bomb planters last week. The police did not even try to hide the fact that it was shoot to kill, that they believed that the man was probably a suicide bomber and that basically, while they deeply regretted the error, they were not about to change their orders to shoot suspected bombers on sight. We are entering dangerous territory here. The entire incident leaves a very queasy feeling. As we all remember, Northern Ireland went through somewhat the same experience during the 1980s when a shoot to kill policy operated among secret British security units seeking to cut down suspected IRA operatives. It was not successful then and it will not be successful in London. In Northern Ireland the policy brought about a wave of revulsion in Nationalist areas and led to greatly increased support for the IRA. In London the tactics will merely play into the hands of the terrorists. This is their exact aim, to break down the rule of law, create havoc and uncertainty and force brutal methods by police in return for their own violence, thereby creating a vicious circle. It is understandable that Londoners feel extremely ill at ease with the recent bombings, but it is still no excuse for their police to gun down an innocent man in cold blood before a carriage full of horrified spectators. Shoot to kill in Northern Ireland was eventually one of the greatest embarrassments the British forces experienced in the 30 years of the Troubles. It took one of their own men, a senior British policeman named John Stalker, to point the finger of blame squarely where it belonged, at a runaway secret unit which had only disdain for the law they were supposedly enforcing. Equally, if in response to the shooting death in England there is no brake put on the use of deadly force in uncertain situations, we will see other repeats of this incident. The impact that will have on young Muslim men, already feeling disenfranchised, can be figured out pretty easily. There is no easy solution to dealing with urban terrorism, and it is extraordinarily difficult to penetrate the cells that carry it out. However, resorting to untimely violence only makes the situation worse, not better, as the experience of Northern Ireland adequately proves. After all, we are still living with the aftermath of shoot to kill in the North, especially in the case of Belfast lawyer Pat Finucane who was gunned down in front of his family by a death squad. The ramifications from that case are still spreading. Deadly force is not some game on a Play Station. The way to deal with the terrorist threat, as the Israelis have shown, is through excellent intelligence gathering and a range of preventive measures. Shooting innocent victims in cold blood is no way to bring about a solution. Article copyright Irish Tribune.",NA,Irish Voice,2005-07-27,1
"WHEN the London bombs went off I was on holiday in the South of France with the family. The day it happened I was actually escaping from my responsibilities by doing a powerboat driving course near Cap Ferrat. The two instructors were British, easy-going guys who run boat courses on the French Riviera every summer. As the news came through - there are cell phones everywhere - nothing much was said on board, apart from everyone agreeing that such savagery is inhuman. What can one say, when faced with such mindless horror? But the unspoken question hung in the air. What's the difference between this and what the IRA did in London in the recent past? The answer, of course, is that there is no difference at all. In spite of the words of sympathy and the carefully phrased condemnation from Gerry Adams, the uncomfortable truth is that there is little if any difference between the Islamic terrorists who bombed London and the IRA terrorists who did the same thing a few years back As far as we know there is no connection between the IRA and Muslim extremists in Britain, and I know that even raising such a possibility will be greeted by howls of outrage. But is it so far fetched? If the IRA are happy to earn a few million training drug-smuggling thugs in Colombia who think nothing of blowing up women and children, why should they not help terrorists who want to attack Britain, the ancient enemy? Even making a comparison between the London Islamic bombers (or the al-Qaeda American attackers) and the IRA is seen in some quarters as unacceptable. But the fundamental question about what goes on in the minds of the young men who do these outrages is the same whether the bombers in question are young Muslims with Pakistani connections or young Catholics with Irish connections. There has been a great deal of soul searching in Britain in the past week trying to understand how a young Muslim raised in the U.K. could carry out such an atrocity in what is his own country. But some of those involved in IRA terrorism in Britain were either born in the U.K. or had been resident and integrated there for years. It is possible to point to the alienation of the Muslim community in parts of Britain, just as it was possible to point to the suppression of Catholics in the North over many years. It is also possible to point to Britain's courageous involvement in the removal of Saddam and the attempt to bring democracy to Iraq. But nothing, not the supposed alienation of young Muslims in Leeds or London, not even opposition to the war in Iraq, can justify the murder of innocent civilians. Nor can anything that happened in the North, no matter how unfair it was to the Catholic population, justify the campaign of terror that was waged by the IRA against the civilian population in the U.K. Whether it is the IRA or Islamic suicide bombers, there is no difference between such actions when they result in the murder of innocent civilians going about their daily lives. Both are terrorism, pure and simple. You cannot parse the language or prevaricate about the threat that such terrorism poses. You have to recognize it clearly for what it is and oppose it. Sinn Fein spokesmen here have been eager to point out what they see as key differences between the IRA and the Islamic terrorists. For a start they don't accept that the IRA were ever involved in terrorism. The IRA don't do suicide bombings, they give warnings and they don't deliberately target civilians, they say. Yeah, right Remember the Hyde Park bombing, when hundreds of civilians were on the streets of London watching the toy horse soldiers on parade? Remember the pub bombings in Britain? The targets in at least one case were supposed to be off-duty soldiers, but what thought was given to all the ordinary civilians who would be around? Remember the more recent massive Canary Wharf blast? Does anyone seriously think that you can let off a bomb that big in a city without endangering civilians? And what's the difference between a suicide bomber and a proxy bomber, where an unfortunate civilian is forced to drive a bomb to a target while his family is threatened? The only difference is that the suicide bomber is a courageous if misguided fanatic while the IRA man is a weasel who forces someone else (a proxy) to carry the bomb. The notion that the IRA was particularly concerned about avoiding the killing of women or children is also a bit hard to swallow. Remember the kids who died in Warrington? And the idea that there is a difference because the IRA don't do no-warning bombs is also naive. The fact is that warnings were not given in some IRA bombings and in others the warnings were either so incoherent or inaccurate that they were ineffective or counter-productive. The lengthy list of injured, maimed and murdered civilians in IRA operations both in Britain and Northern Ireland over the years is testament to the savagery of the IRA campaign. To pretend that there is some difference in scale or intent between what the Muslim bombers did in London a couple of weeks ago and what the IRA were guilty of at various times over the past 30 years is not credible. Part of the reluctance here to call a spade a spade, of course, is a desire not to upset the peace process applecart. We are told that there could be an announcement any day now from the Republican movement here ... or on the other hand there may not be any breakthrough for a couple of months. It all depends on who you listen to. One thing seems certain. No one is talking anymore about the IRA being disbanded. We may not even be talking about a verified total disarming by the IRA. What seems to be on the cards is an announcement that the IRA is changing itself into some kind of inactive Old Heroes organization, accompanied by a major amount of decommissioning of its weapons stockpile. We are being softened up by a succession of advance leaks and briefings to accept this statement by the IRA, whenever it comes, as a historic breakthrough, whatever the text actually says and whatever fudging it contains. We will have to wait and see how convincing it is, but Republicans can hardly blame us for being skeptical. In the meantime we will have to go on listening to senior Sinn Fein leaders making disingenuous remarks about Muslim extremists in Britain, about how the IRA is different and cannot be compared to such atrocities. There will be huge pressure on people here to accept that whatever the IRA comes up with is the real deal, the end of violence for good and the total and unequivocal acceptance of democracy. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern is giving the impression of someone who is so desperate for a deal at this stage that he may not stick to his earlier public insistence that this time there can be no fudge. Fortunately for Irish democracy, Ian Paisley has to be satisfied as well, along with the leaders of the other political parties north and south. No one wants to prejudge what the IRA will announce. We will hope for the best and read what they have to say in an accepting frame of mind. But the election here is over and the seats are won, and the embarrassment of the McCartney murder and the Northern Bank robbery are fading. Of course Republicans want to get into power in the North. But there is a general perception here that they feel the pressure is off them for the moment and the breakthrough they offer may be scaled down somewhat as a result. They can brush off any comparisons with Islamic extremists in Britain with their usual contempt. And most people will swallow it. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"Myron Kuropas's e-mail address is: kuropas@comcast.net. A number of prominent Americans - including Henry Kissinger and Madeline Albright - are supporting Ukraine's membership in the European Union. Prominent Europeans, on the other hand, primarily French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac, have voiced opposition. For once, they may be right. There are many reasons why Ukraine should approach EU membership cautiously. The first reason is Ukraine's tentative national identity. Despite the amazing success of the Orange Revolution, Ukraine's self-concept is still a work in progress. In some ways, eastern Ukraine remains more Russian than Ukrainian. There are still those in Ukraine who are pushing for the recognition of Russian as Ukraine's second official language. In his recent book, Clash of Civilizations, Samuel Huntington describes Ukraine as a cleft country with two distinct cultures. Ukraine's religio-cultural issues remain unresolved. The Russian Orthodox Church is Ukraine's largest religious body and this is not a good thing. Russian Orthodoxy constitutes the core of the Russian soul and has served as a vehicle of Russification for centuries. The Russian patriarch has never been amenable to the notion of true religious freedom. Another reason to proceed with wariness regarding EU membership is Europe itself. Old Europe has lost its moral compass. The nihilistic thinking of Nietzche, Sartre, Freud, Marx, Heidegger, Marcuse and Foucault have replaced the universal ideals of Aristotle, Aquinas, Erasmus, Locke and Montesquieu. Irreverance and irrelevance have become the guiding ideals of Europe's intellectual elite and the cultural consequences are devastating. In his book From Dawn to Decadence, Jacques Barzun suggests that Western civilization has entered a period of malaise, a kind of dissatisfaction with the present, demonstrated by the search in all directions for new faiths, for new directions. The Germans have a name for this type of world weariness: weltschmertz. Europe's elite believes that it was nationalism that led to the horrors of two world wars. If nationalism was the problem, then a cultural and socialist union of European countries, sanctioned by a 300-page Constitution and led by an ever-expanding bureaucracy, was the answer. Ukraine has just unshackled itself from just such an arrangement; it was called the Soviet Union. Is there any real difference between the concepts of the new Soviet man and the new European. Is Ukraine ready to lose its long-sought sovereignty only to be swallowed up again? Nationalism is not a bad word in today's Ukraine. Europe's elite appears Christophobic, as evidenced by the EU Constitution, which neglects to mention Europe's rich Judeo-Christian heritage. This is not an accident. In his book The Cube and the Cathedral, George Weigel writes that Europe's elite lacks spiritual roots, fears the future, and places personal interests and rights over universal truths and ethics. While people in Ukraine are rediscovering their Christianity, Western Europeans are abandoning theirs. While people in Ukraine are building churches, Europeans are closing theirs. Another example of Europe's transformation is the diminishing family. Europe's overall fertility rate is 1.5 children per family. With the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain now sanctioning gay marriage, the population meltdown will continue. At the same time, the Islamic population in Europe is exploding - 700,000 Muslims in the Netherlands alone. Muslims in Europe have large families and they are not assimilating. The result of this type of colonization is unclear. According to British historian Niall Ferguson: A creeping Islamicization of a decadent Christendom is one conceivable result; while the old Europeans get even older and their religious faith weaker, the Muslim colonies within their cities get larger and more overt in their religious observance. Islamic inroads into Europe is not a new problem for Western civilization. There was a time when Europe vigorously resisted the military onslaught of Islam, culminating first at the gates of Paris in 732 and then at the gates of Vienna in 1683. Resistance by Europe is no longer an option. In a well-documented study, titled Eurabia: The Euro-Arab Axis, Bat Ye'or describes Europe's evolution from a Judeo-Christian civilization, with important post-Enlightenment secular elements, into a post-Judeo-Christian civilization that is subservient to the ideology of jihad and the Islamic powers that propagate it. This approach has evolved into a virulent anti-Americanism which, according to the author is the result of a profound resentment that cowardly or impotent societies, which have chosen surrender through fear of conflict, have toward those who stand strong. At a NATO summit in Istanbul in June, 2004, President George W. Bush blamed autocratic Arab rulers for fostering a culture of extremism and resentment of the West. He recognized European complicity by declaring: In the last 60 years many in the West have added to this distrust by excusing tyranny in the region, hoping to purchase stability at the price of liberty. Ukraine has felt the sword of Islam throughout its history and should avoid falling prey to Islamic blackmail. A recent political conference in Kyiv ostensibly condemning Zionism reportedly included a strong Arab presence. This is a step in the wrong direction. Europe's faltering economy is another problem. An overly generous welfare system, labor protections, a progressive tax structure, zoning restrictions on large retailers and a work force that has lost the work ethic, does not augur well for Western Europeans. French workers complain about their 35-hour work week and six weeks of annual vacation. Italian workers go on strike just because they can. Meanwhile, millions of Ukrainians and other workers from the new Europe fill in the labor gaps. Ukraine has a bright future. In some ways Ukraine today is like Ireland was in the 1970s. For over a century, immigration was the only choice for Irish seeking a better life. Today, Ireland is an affluent nation, a Celtic Tiger with a market-oriented leadership, a young, educated and eager work force, low taxes and a business climate that attracts foreign investment. Ukraine has a young, educated and eager work force, and a market-oriented president. The model for Ukraine should be new Ireland, not old Europe!

"From the late Ottoman period to the present modern Turkish State, Ottoman-Turkish foreign policy establishments continuously played one regional or global power against another. In the past, they successfully established alliances with the strongest global powers against foreign powers that they considered to be adversaries. To mention a few historical instances, when Egyptian strongman Muhammed Ali revolted against the Ottoman Sultan Mahmut II and invaded the southern Ottoman districts, reached Central Anatolia and conquered Konya (Iconium) in 1831-1833, the Sultan asked for assistance from the Russian Czar Nicholas I to stop the Egyptian strongman, and they were forced to retreat. Yet, in 1853-1856, during the Crimean War, Mahmut's son Sultan Abdulmecit I formed an alliance with Great Britain and France to check the rising Russian imperial power. In fact, Russia lost the war and had to surrender the Crimea, the Black Sea coast and part of Eastern Anatolia to the victors. SULTAN ABDULHAMIT II PLAYS BRITISH AGAINST RUSSIANS After Abdulmecit's death, the Red Sultan Abdulhamit II took the reigns of power. During his reign, another Russo-Turkish war started and, during 1877 and 1878, the Russian army rapidly advanced into the Balkans and Eastern Anatolia. During this campaign, the czar's army captured Kars and Ardahan and reached the gates of Erzurum. The British, fearing Czarist Russian control of the Straits and the Mediterranean basin, came to rescue the Ottomans from the Russian threat by offering to send British expeditionary forces into Eastern Anatolia to drive the Russians back to the Caucasus. The Russians finally signed the Treaty of San Stefano in 1876, which preceded the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. With both treaties, the Ottomans allowed the introduction of reforms in the Armenian-inhabited Eastern Anatolian provinces. Red Sultan Abdulhamit II was dethroned in 1909 by Ittihadist forces and the infamous Young Turk period started, lasting until 1918. During this period, the Ittihadists, led by the triumvirate Talat, Enver and Djemal pashas, were convinced that by establishing an alliance with Imperial Germany, they would be able to defeat their old foes, the Russians, the gates of the Caucasus and Central Asia would become wide open with the realization of Pan-Turkism, and the Pan-Turkist empire would become a reality. In order to clear their pathway and motivated by the burning desire to homogenize the Anatolian population, the Ittihadists, in predictable fashion, planned to clear Anatolia from unwanted Christian elements. For this reason they gave orders to conduct the mass deportation and destruction of the Armenians. The Ittihadists used Special Forces, along with Muslim refugees dislocated during the Balkan War and local Kurds, to accelerate the destruction of the Armenians. MUSTAFA KEMAL IMPOSES WILL ON MAJOR POWERS The Entente Powers won and World War I ended with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and Imperial Germany. The British, French, Italian, and Greek forces invaded the former Ottoman territories and divided the land into different administrative zones. The Turkish Nationalist Forces, under Mustafa Kemal, defied foreign occupation. In order to evict the invaders, Kemalist forces now formed an alliance with the Bolsheviks in Russia. The Turkish-Russian collaboration under Mustafa Kemal (Ataturk) and Vladimir Lenin aimed to curb British imperialist expansionism in the Near East, the Caucasus, and Central Asia. Yet Ataturk did not trust the Russians either. He created a wedge among adversaries and, using Russians, British, French and Americans against each other, he was successful in imposing Ankara's will in the Treaty of Lausanne drawn up in 1923. From the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 until the death of its founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in 1938, the nation building process operated under the slogans Republicanism, Nationalism, Populism, Revolutionist Reformism, Secularism and Etatism. Economic, social, linguistic, and religious reforms were carried out with iron fists, dissention was never tolerated, and many intellectuals, religious figures, communists, political dissidents and Kurdish nationalists were executed in order to preserve the Kemalist ideology and the unitarian state. Although Kemalist nationalists were mostly former Ittihadists (who were one way or other involved in the Armenian deportations and massacres and were sitting on Armenian money, estates and properties), Ataturk, in order not to alienate Russians, kept the Pan-Turkists under strict control. Ataturk signed a non-aggression treaty with Russia in 1925 yet maintained excellent relations with Great Britain, France, Italy, and the US. He also established cordial relations with Greece. During Ataturk's last year, the former Ottoman territory of Hatay, then a Syrian district under French control, declared its independence, and after his death the district was annexed by the Turkish Republic. INTERNATIONAL CRISIS DURING WWII During the presidency of Ismet Inonu, close lieutenant to Ataturk and former Ittihadist, Turks again faced an international crisis. In Germany, National Socialists (Nazis) under Adolf Hitler and, in U.S.S.R, Communists under Joseph Stalin signed a non-aggression treaty on August 23, 1939. On October 19, 1939, Turkey entered into an agreement of mutual cooperation with Great Britain. After World War II broke out and Hitler's armies began invading Poland, Czechoslovakia, Soviet Ukraine, Soviet Byelorussia and Soviet Russia, the Turkish president, sure of a Nazi German victory over Russia, allowed all former Pan-Turkists to join the government. Turkey declared its so-called neutrality and prevented any British and American assistance from reaching beleaguered Russia, while secretly aiding the Nazi war efforts. When British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the Turkish president for assistance to aid the Allied war efforts, Turks demanded control over the Mosul and Kirkuk oilfields as well as the Suez Canal. The Russian victory in Stalingrad over Hitler's invading army on February 2, 1943 sent Shockwaves through Ankara. It was no secret that the Turkish Eastern Army near the border of Soviet Armenia was poised to invade Armenia if the Germans prevailed against the Russians. Now, to the dismay of the Pan-Turkists, this plan had to be aborted. After the end of World War II and, at the time of the Nazi surrender to the Allied Forces, Turkey declared war on the defeated Nazi Germany. Intoxicated with victory, the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin had an increased appetite to gobble up the entire Eastern Europe. Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania all became communist satellite states. Stalin also instigated a communist insurrection in Greece and demanded that Turkey to return Kars and Ardahan and to establish Soviet control on the straits in 1946. The U.S. warned Russia not to get involved in the Greek civil war or to bother the Turks either; this warning not only curbed Stalin's appetite but also opened the doors for fruitful Turkish-American Cooperation, which lasted until the second invasion of Iraq in 2003. Turkey's foreign policy establishments made the correct decision in casting their lot with Western alliances. After entering NATO on February 18, 1952 and assuming the role of the front line against the Communist and Soviet expansionist threats directed against the interests of Western Europe and the U.S., the Turks were able to receive huge amounts of economic and military assistance. This lucrative alliance made Turkey a regional power. COMMONWEALTH OF TURKIC STATES DOESN'T MATERIALIZE In 1991, the Soviet Union and Communism collapsed and the Cold War era came to an end: Fifteen Soviet republics, including Armenia, declared their independence, one by one. Except for the Baltic States of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, all twelve former republics formed the Newly Independent States (NIS) or the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS.) Later, the fragmentation of the CIS into GUAM (Georgia, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Moldova) and the Shanghai groups (Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, with the participation of China) occurred and subgroups were formed/Uzbekistan later pulled out from GUAM. After the collapse of the U.S.S.R., Turkey had high hopes of creating a Commonwealth of Turkic States, with the participation of Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan, under the leadership of Turkey. Despite some successes, lack of funding, the reluctance of Central Asian leaders to substitute the Russian Big Brother for a Turkish one, and the successful political maneuvering of the Russians, Chinese and Iranians prevented the Turks from achieving their ultimate goals. Azerbaijan's case is an exception. Linguistically, their language is very akin to Anatolian Turkish. They have been locked in a dispute with Armenia on Karabagh's status. Having been courted by Turkey, Russia, the U.S., and Iran, the Azerbaijanis are trying to enlist everyone's support. Ankara's failure to cooperate with Washington during the second invasion of Iraq in 2003 almost ruptured the existing close relationship between Americans and Turks, which developed painstakingly over five decades. Yet Ankara later realized that the U.S., being the only existing superpower, not only has military, political and financial power, but also the means to impose their will on others. The U.S. not only invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, they have now also laid a strategic road map to democratize and change the whole Middle East. The American-Kurdish alliance in Iraq not only irked the Turks but also fanned anti-Americanism throughout Turkey. The Kurds' ascendancy to power in northern Iraq (Iraqi Kurdistan), and their sharing of power with a new American-backed Iraqi government created not only resentment in Ankara but also a fear that Kurds in Turkey might demand cultural autonomy. TURKEY IN AWE OF U.S. POWER The U.S. was instrumental in dismantling the Yugoslavia Federation into the independent republics of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Slovenia, and Serbia. The Turks realize that the U.S. was also instrumental in bringing about the Rose Revolution in Georgia, the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine (where pro-Western forces took power) as well as the government change in Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. also sympathized with anti-government demonstrators in Uzbekistan. The Turks are also convinced that the U.S., in order to stimulate the democratization process in the region, is ready to bring changes to Azerbaijan and even Armenia. The Turks not only respect but also are also afraid of the awesome power the U.S. holds. Turks are puzzled that the U.S. is acting independently without consulting Ankara and, for the fist time, Turks are feeling that Americans do not need them and America is not taking into consideration Turkish national interests. Turks are now realizing that the U.S. is in a position to control the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) oil pipelines in Azerbaijan and Georgia. The U.S. already has a military base in Georgia, and Azerbaijanis are begging Washington to establish a base on their territory. Yerevan, with its complementary policy, is not only strengthening the Russian military base in Armenia but is also cultivating close military, political and economic relations with NATO, Western Europe, and the U.S. For the Turks, it was easy to compete with Russia in the Caucasus and Central Asia but, with the U.S., it is a completely different ballgame. Next we will discuss Turkey and its relations with the European Union. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2005-07-16,1
"As I read an article (reprinted below) the other day about Greece's purchase of new fighter jets from the United States and tanks from Germany, it occurred to me what are the Greeks doing with this hardware. You know Greece has some serious economic problems, and the Country has a lot of expensive catching up to do in order to be competitive in the new European order. Maybe Greece should look again at its level of defense spending. At 5% of GDP, Greece is very high. (U.S. 3.5%, Spain 1.3%, Italy 1.9%, Germany 1.5%, France 2.7%). That is a big chunk of domestic spending, which Greece could use far better on schools, roads and infrastructure, especially after the disastrous costs of the Olympics. To be sure Turkey's 6% of GDP is also high, but these countries are playing a fools game of defense spending ... twice as much as others in the region. If the whole world desperately wants a Muslim country in the European fold, Turkey is the only bet in town, and if that is true, just where does Greece have these tanks pointed? Mixed message to Turkey if you ask me. Maybe Greece is selling Atlantic Bank to raise money for the down payment on the jets. Now that's sound economic planning! Athens, Greece (AP) - Greece will buy 30 new F-16 fighter jets from the United States at an estimated cost of 1.1 billion (US$1.32 billion), the government said Tuesday. Defense Minister Spilios Spiliotopoulos said Athens would sign a direct agreement with Washington for the U.S.-made F-16 Block 52+ fighters, which will be delivered by 2009, and will have an option of buying an additional 10 aircraft. Spiliotopoulos said the deal was made directly with the American government and was not the result of an international bidding process. The American government will send us its offer, there will be negotiations, and then the deal will be struck, Spiliotopoulos said after a meeting of the government's foreign policy and defense committee. He said his conservative New Democracy party had left open the possibility of directly awarding defense contracts - even though the party had criticized the former Socialist government of such practices. The conservatives had in the past accused the Socialists of lacking transparency in directly awarding state contracts. The plane deal was worth about 1.1 billion (US.1.32 billion) at the old prices. We will set final prices through negotiations, Spiliotopoulos said, but did not provide further details. Greece currently has 40 F-16 Bloc 30's bought in 1998, as well as 40 F-16 Bloc 50s and 60 F-16 block 52+ which it ordered in 2001. It also flies 34 French-made Mirage 2000s. Greece plans to buy at least another 30 fighter jets by 2010, but has not yet decided on the type, Spiliotopoulos said. The government also approved the purchase of 333 used German-made tanks from the German government. The tanks, all German army stockpiles, were worth an estimated 270 million (US$323.06 million) and were part of an interim deal until Greece receives a batch of 172 new Leopard II Hel's it ordered in 2001. Greece has spent a large portion of its gross domestic product - about 5 percent - on defense for decades to stave off a perceived threat from neighboring NATO ally Turkey. The two neighbors have long-standing disputes over the war-divided island of Cyprus and the Aegean Sea. They have nearly gone to war three times since 1974. The American government will send us its offer, there will be negotiations, and then the deal will be struck, Spiliotopoulos said after a meeting of the government's foreign policy and defense committee.

"THE news of the London bombings last week created a very uncomfortable déjà vu moment for those of us who remember only too well some of the awful bombings the IRA carried out in that city. I worked for a time in London in the early 1970s and can remember clearly the reaction from ordinary English people when an IRA bomb exploded. It was time to keep your head down, to stick with your own and keep contact with natives to a minimum. The real damage the IRA caused in London was to the Irish community itself, which became a target for hate and suspicion. I imagine there are many in the Muslim community going through that same direct experience around now. The bombers ensure that it is their own community which suffers the most, as the Irish did back then. In such circumstances a community is forced inwards upon itself, with everyone under suspicion. It took the Irish about 20 years after the beginning of the IRA campaign to dig themselves out. Now it is actually cool to be Irish in England, a far cry from that period in the 1970s. It was a time when having an Irish accent was a huge hindrance. Some of my friends adopted fake British ones just in order to make their lives easier. The look of contempt and suspicion was enough to make it clear that you were not welcome. The intimidation was often indirect. There always seemed to be a police van outside Irish pubs when Paddies came out with a few drinks too many. When you applied for a job you knew your prospects were lessened the second you opened your mouth. Nothing was ever said, but you knew the score. It was a time of strong anti-Irish sentiment, when Irish jokes were a staple of British comedians and the boats and planes from Ireland were still full of arriving emigrants fleeing the poor economy back home. They received a poor welcome. It was hard to blame the Londoners to some extent. After all, their historic city was being blasted month in and month out by bombers who cared nothing for human life. Innocent casualties and panic were the order of the day. Though there were bomb warnings, some were botched and civilians, including young children, died. Sometimes Irish born were among the injured and killed. It seemed so counter-productive as a tool to threaten the British that one had to wonder what genius had decided that bombing London was the route to a united Ireland. The political arguments about Northern Ireland and the plight of the Nationalist community there were utterly overshadowed. The British atrocities such as Bloody Sunday were being rapidly forgotten and the high ground was utterly conceded. That seemed obvious to anyone living in London at the time. The IRA discovered the stupidity of that tactic eventually, but there is no guarantee that the al-Qaeda killers will. Compared to these terrorists the IRA were gentlemen bombers. They gave warnings, avoided mass transit and latterly focused exclusively on economic targets rather than individuals. That does not excuse what they did, but at least their actions showed a political progression from the nihilist bombings of my time there, to the evolving political strategy which eventually led to the peace process and the end of the bombing campaigns. Obviously a resolution of the situation in Iraq, of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and other issues of contention could create a different dynamic. But we should not forget that September 11 occurred long before Iraq, at a time of relative stability in the Middle East and utterly without warning. The problem is that there are those in al-Qaeda who believe that packing an explosive into a knapsack and letting it explode on a crowded train or bus is somehow a courageous act. All the security in the world cannot protect against that, no more than it could on a New York or London subway. What has to change is the climate in the community itself, as it did with the Irish issue. Muslim leaders need to stand up and stand out. Alas, while some have done so many others have not. We can only hope they will do so soon. We do not need any more Londons or Madrids. Article copyright Irish Tribune.","O'Dowd, Niall",Irish Voice,2005-07-13,1
"ODD as it may seem, the first reaction of many people in Dublin to the London bombings last Thursday was a collective sigh of relief. It's weird, wrote one Irish woman on Blúire.com (http://Blúire.com), her blog. My reaction was, thank God it isn't the IRA. Time was when Irish Republicans were blowing up London in my name and the name of every other Irish person. The problem with that was I didn't ask them to, I condemned what they did and it made me feel ashamed. So, when the news broke that it was a group linked to al-Qaeda, I breathed a sigh of relief that it's not the IRA. Terrorism is terrorism, no justification for it, but I was glad that Republicans weren't involved. They caused enough damage to London. And now London is damaged again. It didn't take long for other reactions to make themselves known. My personal favorite was the reaction of some of the 60,000 GAA fans in Croke Park who showed their true class at the Ulster football final on Sunday. Viewers at home across the Republic and across the North would have had some breathtaking moments watching Armagh snatch a draw from the jaws of certain defeat at the hands of Tyrone, but it was something else entirely that caused many other viewers to gasp. The GAA had called for a moment of silence to honor the victims of last week's London bomb attacks. Some of the fans present took the opportunity to chant IRA slogans during the quiet, and they were clearly audible on the live feed on BBC Northern Ireland. Think about that for just a minute. As these fans were driving or taking the train down last Sunday, the newspapers and radio reports would have detailed the grisly ongoing work by police in recovering body parts from the London Underground in hopes of identifying the remains. At the very moment these people were using Croke Park as a platform for their taunts, families were begging police for some estimate about when they might even be able to confirm that their missing loved one was among the dead and dismembered. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern was said to be appalled by the display. But GAA officials, including President Sean Kelly, shrugged their shoulders and said that while it might be regrettable there was nothing they could do about it. On further reflection, the GAA openly wondered if perhaps the best thing in future might be to cancel all moments of silence all together. Maybe it's time for a change, said GAA spokesman Feargal McGill. They are not breaking any laws and it is a matter for their own conscience. It's not like we could have thrown them out of the stadium. GAA officials felt perfectly comfortable, however, throwing Frank Hogan out of Croke Park. Limerickman Hogan was affectionately known as John 3:7 after he attended matches for 11 years. The retired shopkeeper was refused entry to Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day this year because he planned to hold up a sign referring to that line of Scripture - a not unfamiliar sight at college football games in the U.S. So, in the mind of the GAA, taunting the victims and survivors of a terrorist attack in London while in Croke Park is a matter for their own conscience. A harmless old shopkeeper proudly and harmlessly providing either spiritual enlightenment or utterly inoffensive local color, however, is someone they can bar from Croker. While it would be correct to say that the vast majority of Irish people didn't share the mind-boggling glee of those GAA fans, it would be incorrect to say that there weren't mixed feelings about it among a lot of Irish people. When RTE's flagship radio program, 5-7 Live, kicked off that evening's newscast, the subject was beyond describing what had happened on the day and offered reactions. First was a clip of a statement by British Prime Minister Tony Blair. And just after that was an interview with Tony Benn. Benn is just about as far to the left as you can get in British politics without falling off the map entirely. As bodies were still cooling in Tavistock Square, Benn was brought on to give voice to what a lot of people in RTE were thinking - the bombings were Blair's fault for siding with that maniac George W. Bush. I think that when people sit back and think about it, they will ask themselves the question. Just as the Spaniards did when, after the Madrid bombing, they pulled out of Iraq, Benn said. Asked if he believed Britain would not have been attacked if it had not backed the U.S. in the Iraq War, Benn continued, Well there were no bombs in Paris. There were no bombs in Berlin. But there were in Madrid where they'd sent the troops in. There were in London. So if it's confirmed that this is al-Qaeda, why would they want to attack London if we weren't bombing, occupying and bombing Afghanistan and Iraq? This sentiment was already being uttered by some Irish folk as well, out there in the ether of the Internet, and by anti-war anti-hero Richard Boyd-Barrett (who has an unlikely double-barrel posh name for someone in charge of the Socialist Workers Party). George Galloway, the Scottish-born MP who now represents the heavily Muslim East London constituency where many of the wounded were taken, agreed wholeheartedly. None of those reactions are, regrettably, particularly surprising. These folks are the usual suspects to channel, for their own purposes, whatever anti-American spleen is handy. What was a bit surprising was that RTE decided that Benn's views were so important that they gave them pride of place. After the exclusive interview with Benn, they cut to a clip of a British Conservative politician speaking to a press conference for a fig leaf of balance. In other words, Benn was the great get - the sort of voice who was important to give prominence to on the day and into which RTE put effort in getting on air. On Sunday, as those Tyrone and Armagh GAA fans figured out what chants they'd use to disgrace their country, RTE's prestigious Sunday Show also helped set the tone. Presented by rugby commentator and opinion columnist Tom McGurk, its discussion on the London attacks featured the odious Robert Fisk, joined by other panelists who strove to outdo each other in blaming American and British policy for the bombing. Not even a token voice of opposition was brought in. (Although - full disclosure - my wife, who is English and no fan of Bush or Blair but recognizes evil for what it is, was on an earlier segment of the same program.) Fisk actually spent more time during the broadcast complaining that he was being censored by the BBC than in expressing any anger that some 70 of his countrymen had been killed for the crime of going to work by train or bus. I am certainly not saying that the eager schadenfreude about the London bombings within large sections of the Irish media led directly to those GAA thugs taunting the dead at Croke Park on Sunday. I am saying that you should realize that there are a surprising amount of people in Ireland who do not want Britain and America to win this - or any - war. And that perhaps the majority of the rest of the people in Ireland think that opinion is simply a matter for their own conscience.

"IRISH police are monitoring a group of men in Ireland whom Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern and Justice Minister Michael McDowell believe may be supplying support to al-Qaeda. Some of the group were previously linked to al-Qaeda front company in Dublin named Mercy International Relief Agency. Both Ahern and McDowell have said that surveillance of the men will be stepped up following last week's bomb attacks in London which killed over 50 people. The U.S. government has already asked the Irish police to closely monitor a Libyan man living in Dublin named Ibrahim Buisir, who worked for Mercy International but said that he believed the organization was legitimate. The organization was set up to help bombings in Britain and the European continent and was modeled on the African section of Mercy International, which was used to bomb the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. The U.S. government now believes that some of men from the Dublin branch are helping to fund terrorism through the Islamic International Relief Agency and other international front groups. Buisir was publicly named by Treasury Secretary John W. Snow last October as a financier for al-Qaeda and Hamas, a claim Buisir strongly denies. Following raids on an Islamic charity in Missouri last October, Snow banned Buisir and four other men from traveling to the U.S. and ordered all U.S. financial institutions to seize any funds they hold. Buisir, based in Ballinteer in south Dublin, has been questioned by Gardai (police) several times and was formerly a prominent official in the Muslim Council of Ireland. The president of the council, Imam Dr. Abduljalil Sajid, previously told the Irish Voice that Buisir was law abiding and that it appeared that the U.S. was looking for easy targets. U.S., Irish and British police believe that operations in Dublin may be controlled by people very high up in al-Qaeda. Just last week, Iraqi TV showed footage of Saudi insurgents captured by the U.S. who admitted that they were funded by Dr. Safir al-Hawali, a director of Mercy International, the now-defunct Dublin charity. The U.S. allowed the footage to be shown to show the effect of al-Hawali and other radical Saudi clerics. Al-Hawali, who was once one of Osama bin Laden's closest spiritual advisors, wrote an open letter to President Bush after September 11, saying that the attacks had sent a wave of joy through Muslims throughout the world. In numerous court cases in upstate New York, Ohio and Virginia, U.S. prosecutors have sought to detain suspected extremists for possessing some of al-Hawali's fiery anti-American speeches or widely distributed audio tapes. U.S. authorities are still searching for a vicious extremist named Hamid Aich, who was also based in Terenure, Co. Dublin and was the day to day operator of Mercy International. Aich, originally from Morocco, fled Dublin when Gardai clamped down on Islamic extremists. He had been arguing for extremism and had tried to muster greater support for al-Qaeda among Dublin Muslims, the vast majority of whom reject radicalism. He was arrested by Gardai but fled the country before computer experts found designs for explosives on his computer. U.S. authorities are deeply worried about Aich and blamed the Gardai for letting him go. He was previously a housemate to a man convicted of trying to drive a car bomb over the U.S. border during the millennium celebrations. The FBI want to question Aich, who previously fought for Muslims during the Bosnian war, about his knowledge of the millennium bomb plot. This reporter previously made a call to Dr. al Hawaii at his office in Saudi Arabia, seeking information about Mercy International. An FBI agent called to my home, explaining that al Hawaii's phone calls were being monitored. He said phone records had shown calls from my home to Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the al-Qaeda number two, who has since been captured. The FBI agent said that al-Hawali and Mohammed were mostly likely in the same circle of people and U.S. operations had linked their phone calls together. In the last two weeks, al Hawali has suffered a brain hemorrhage but has regained consciousness and is at a hospital in Mecca. He has denied that he funds the Iraqi insurgency but does support it and has argued that the cause of Islam outweighs any concern for civilian casualties. Ahern and Minister McDowell's warnings came shortly before British police announced that the London bombers are likely to have been killed in the explosions and that one is very likely to have come from a strongly Muslim area of Leeds. Police believed that they have identified two other bombers, also from around the Leeds area and have found a seizable quantity of explosives in one home. The also seized a car at Luton train station that the men are likely to have driven from Leeds before taking the train to London. Speaking at Dublin City University, Ahern said that al-Qaeda suspects were being watched closely and that Gardai would continue to make every effort to stop Islamic extremism from developing in Ireland. McDowell said that a number of men based in Ireland are now under close police surveillance. In the past there has been evidence that some people in Ireland, who have an extremist point of view, have been engaging in logistical support activities for terrorist-type activities in Europe and elsewhere. That is a worrying thing, he said. He also warned that Islamic extremists may be basing themselves in Ireland in order to avail of the common travel area between the state and the U.K. Meanwhile, British police have strongly dismissed an Irish Sunday Independent report which claimed that British government ministers believed the London bombs were the work of a tiny, non-U.K. terror cell. One officer in their communications department in London said that the claim just doesn't seem to hold at all, given the developments in Leeds. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"I started writing YES in the days following the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York City. I felt an urgent need to respond to the rapid demonization of the Arab world in the West and to the parallel wave of hatred against America. I asked myself the question: what can a filmmaker do in such an atmosphere of hate and fear? What are the stories that need to be told? Instinctively I turned to love and to verse (and to humor). Love, because it is ultimately a stronger force than hate; and verse, because its deep rhythms and its long tradition (from medieval sonnets to Icelandic sagas to rap) enable ideas to be expressed in lyrical ways that might otherwise be indigestible, abstract or depersonalized. (And humor, because in the face of such heavy global hysteria, the need for levity becomes stronger than ever.) Whereas a documentary can explore the, underlying historical and political issues, a work of fiction needs to venture into emotional terrain: the experiences we have in common, whatever our differences. So I began writing an argument between two lovers, one a man from the Middle East (Lebanon), the other a woman from the West (an Irish/American) at a point where their love affair has become an explosive war-zone, with the differences in their backgrounds starting to overshadow them as individuals. My job was to create two characters that are contradictory, complex, and sympathetic, with both strengths and weaknesses. I wanted to draw portraits that flow against the tide of cliché (particularly the stereotypes of the enemy over there and the potential enemies within - the exiles, immigrants, and asylum-seekers living in the West. For this reason, also, the man's religion is left deliberately ambiguous.) The argument between the two lovers came out onto the page, for the most part, in iambic pentameter (ten syllables per line). Perhaps my background as a lyricist made me Write this way; as if the film was a song. Or perhaps it was an instinctive attempt to let the characters speak to each other on screen about things that are hard to express in normal conversation. Either way, I tried to find a form in which the characters could speak to each other from somewhere intimate and surprising in themselves. The argument became a sequence that was then made, experimentally, as a five-minute short film. Excited by its possibilities, I then decided to develop the two characters, their storyline, and the mosaic of lives around them, into a feature-length script The sub-plots would include the woman's husband, a betrayed and betraying English politician; their god-daughter, a withdrawn teenager trying to grow up in a beauty and celebrity-obsessed culture; three kitchen hands, each battling with their beliefs and prejudices in the midst of the noise and confusion of the workplace; the heroine's aunt, trying to make sense of her life as it ebbs away, and a cleaner, functioning as a one-woman chorus who sees and hears it all. Each character would be caught in a different kind of solitude, each trying to reach out to those around them, each one trying to be heard; In the screenplay the verse is like a river running through the film as we delve into the characters' thought-streams and back out into their speech. I had learnt from the five-minute film that the actors delivered the verse best, paradoxically, when they ignored it; when they spoke concentrating on the meaning, rather than the rhymes, as if the text was just a heightened form of ordinary speech. (For this reason many viewers of the film don't really notice its rhymes or its meter.) The war in Iraq began as we began rehearsals, with Joan Allen and Simon Abkarian heading a fine, committed cast. Lines from the script became more and more pertinent, as the characters' journey accelerated. We all felt we were working on something urgently contemporary. During the working process we discussed the usual details of design, light and lens, or character and costume. But we also talked passionately about the deeper themes of the film; the struggle to understand each other (East and West, Christian and Muslim); the desire to respect each other's differences and to find a way of living side by side. As world events overtook the story, we had to cancel our shoot in Beirut (the war had made us un-insurable) and Joan Allen, an American citizen, could no longer work in Cuba (thanks to a new Bush administration decree). It took some fancy footwork to overcome these problems. That the film was made at all is testimony to the ingenuity of the producers, Christopher Sheppard and Andrew Fierberg, and the dedication and generosity of the cast, crew, and facility houses, who invested in the film with their unpaid labor or deferred fees to make it possible. It was truly a labor of love. Everyone wanted to contribute to a yes in the face of the destruction and despair of war. All thanks are due also to GreeneStreet Films who were excited enough by the project to decide to finance the film along with The UK Film Council, in times when risk-taking in cinema is increasingly rare.

"The Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America was represented at an ecumenical prayer service on June 6, 2005, in Washington, D.C.'s National Cathedral by Bishop Vicken Aykazian, diocesan legate and ecumenical officer. Organized by Bread for the World, a nationwide Christian movement seeking justice for the world's hungry people by lobbying America's decision makers, the group representing 75 churches vowed to work towards eliminating hunger. Jewish, Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Muslim, Sikh, and Buddhist religious leaders were among those attending the event. They were joined at the service by more than 1,000 officials and supporters, including Rev. Dr. Bob Edgar, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, and Paul Wolfowitz, the new president of the World Bank. The legate delivered a prayer during the service. The churches are very concerned about the hunger, not only in the U.S. but all around the world, Bishop Aykazian said. We are urging our government and other organizations to try to bring their contributions to end this hunger. CHURCH INVOLVEMENT IN FIGHTING HUNGER The day following the prayer service, many of the religious leaders met with English Prime Minister Tony Blair, representatives from the White House, and members of Congress to promote efforts to battle hunger. For Christians, it is our moral responsibility to bring justice to people to end hunger and poverty in the world, said Bishop Aykazian, who noted officials such as Wolfowitz have said that church involvement is key in the battle against hunger. They believe church involvement is very important to end hunger in the world. Already, we see the results of our involvement because the government is much more involved in ending hunger in the world. The Bread for the World coalition is currently pushing the Hunger-Free Communities Act of 2005 through Congress. It would commit the United States to the goals of cutting U.S. food insecurity and hunger in half by 2010, ending U.S. hunger by 2015, and requiring the U.S. Department of Agriculture to report annually on progress toward those goals. It authorizes $50 million for a grant program to fund grassroots groups who collaborate to develop innovative strategies to end hunger, provide direct assistance, and strengthen public programs. HELPING HAND Armenian Church members can work to end hunger by advocating for action on the part of their state and federal representatives, Bishop Aykazian said. Or they can lend a helping hand by collecting donations and volunteer to help the hungry locally and internationally, he added. If parishioners collect money and send it to poor countries, including Armenia, which is among the poorest nations, of course it is very helpful, he said. Reflecting on Biblical passages urging Christians to feed the hungry, Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate of the Eastern Diocese, said it was the duty of parishioners to be sensitive to the needs of the hungry. As individuals, parish communities, and a diocese, it is our responsibility to hear the words of Christ in the Gospels and respond, the Primate said. I am grateful that we have been heeding Christ's message to help the less fortunate. That is why we created FAR (the Fund for Armenian Relief) after the earthquake in Armenia, and why so many of our parishioners continue to support that organization's efforts to not just feed the hungry, but to strengthen our independent nation.

"Barry Chamish believes that the Armenian Genocide was a dry run for the Jewish Holocaust. Berry is a former Israeli military man-turned-investigative reporter, who is warning his fellow Jews about a coming Second Holocaust of the Jews in Israel proper. He has published a few books, which are available from his web site <barrychamish.com>. Barry's research led him to the fact that, basically, both the planners and instigators of the Armenian Genocide of WWI and the Jewish Holocaust of WWII were the same entities and that those same entities are planning another holocaust of the Jews during the coming WWIII. Barry wrote about the outcome of his research along those lines in two articles, which are posted in the articles section of his above-mentioned web site. The first article is Kerry, Gaza and the New Sabbatean Holocaust, and the second, The Deutsch Devils. Barry did his research from four books written in English and Hebrew. The first is Heroes, Antiheroes And The Holocaust by David Morrison, a psychiatric doctor; second, Sabbatean Messianism As Proto-Secularism by Avrum M. Ehrlich; third, 50 Jewish Messiahs by Jerry Rabow; and the fourth, To Eliminate The Opiate by Rabbi Marvin Antelman. In his first article, Barry says, Morrison doesn't realize that he is reporting a Sabbatean massacre, yet he instinctively writes about the Young Turks. On page 48, Morrison writes: The Young Turks who led the 1908 revolution were Turkish nationalists and [they] established secular institutions, overthrowing the religious Moslem order. They viewed Armenians as a direct threat to their revolutionary plans. The evidence is overwhelming that the massacre of the Armenians was a deliberate, planned genocide. The Young Turks allied themselves with Germany and used World War I as a cover for their slaughter of Armenians... As did the Nazis in World War II, the Turks used their intended victims as slave laborers building a trans-Turkish railway for German business interests. Avrum Ehrlich, in his above-mentioned book, writes: The extent to which Jews were involved in the Young Turk revolution is debated, some arguing that Jews and Donme dominated the Committee of the Union and Progress Party (C.U.P) which gained control of the State. Others argue that this was anti-Semitic rhetoric and exaggerated, and that while the Jews supported the revolution on a grass-roots level, they were not highly represented in the upper echelons of the party. Indeed British diplomats did report to the home office that a Jewish-Masonic conspiracy was at work favoring the revolution. The Donme are believed to have been equally involved in the revolution but exact details are less known due to a number of reasons...It was via the Masonic lodges that the Donme, the Jews, Bektashi and secularists who were less accepted in mainstream society were able to meet on an equal footing, many of them becoming major instruments of the revolution...Whether the suspicions that Masonry is responsible for sedition and subversive activities are true or not, in this context they were a convenient home for the revolution, providing lodges and personnel, secrecy and structures for the revolution. The Donme thrived in the Masonic environment, allowing them to be both secretive and influential, maintaining their religious ideas in a non-dogmatic atmosphere. Bridging the gap between the Jews and the Muslims, they seemed to represent the happy medium of the secular Young Turk revolution. Even today Donme are involved in the Masonic Lodges of Turkey. Sahir Talat Akev of the Kapanci-Izmir group of Donme was the Grand Master of the Masons until his death in 1999. Dr. Nazim, Nuzhet Faik, Mustafa Arif, Muslihiddin Adil, Sukru Bleda, Halide Edip Adivar and Ahmet Emin Yalman were all active in the Young Turks and of Donme families. Mehmet Kapanci (1839-1924), who was a mayor of Salonica and a well-known banker, funded the C.U.P and was a Donme. Other Jews active in the Young Turks were Nissim Mazliah from Izmir and Vitali Faradji, Moise Cohen (later called Munis Tekinalp), who was an active Jew and once rabbinical student, who turned to business and actively asserted a proud Turkish identity along with Zionist sentiments...It is curious that Israel's first and second prime ministers, David Ben Gurion and Moshe Sharett, and her second president Yitzchak Ben Zvi, had lived and studied in Istanbul and embraced the concept lehitatmen, Hebrew for to become an Ottoman. Ben Zvi is alleged by some to be the descendant of a Sabbatean family. Sharett served in the Ottoman army in WWI. Ben Gurion gave up Russian citizenship for Ottoman citizenship, something many others in Palestine were afraid to do. Israeli Presidents Ben Zvi, Zalman Shazar and, to a lesser degree, Yitzchak Navon became students of Ottomanism. Mehmet Cavit Bey (1875-1926) was one of the most significant Donme political figures. He was active in the revolution as a highly articulate editor of a tabloid and professor of finance and was three times finance minister of modern Turkey until his execution for his alleged role in the assassination attempt of Ataturk. It is believed that Cavit Bey was an ardent Zionist and saw the advantages for Turkey in the Jewish settlement of Palestine. In the WIKIPEDIA and Jewish Encyclopedias, we read: Donmeh is the Turkish word for 'apostate' and refers to the Jews of the Near East who followed Sabbatai Zevi into Islam in 1666 [S. Zevi took the name Aziz Mehemet], but secretly the remained Jews who continued practicing Jewish rituals but worshiped Sabbatai as the Messiah and incarnation of God. The Turkish author, Mevlan Zade Rifat, was referring to those Donmeh, when he wrote in his book Inner Folds of the Ottoman Revolution (1929): The Armenian genocide was decided in August 1910 and October 1911 by a Young Turk committee composed entirely of displaced Balkan Jews in the format of a syncretistic Jewish-Muslim sect. Including Talaat, Enver, Behaeddin Shakir, Jemal, and Nazim posturing as Muslims, it met in the Rothschild-funded Grant Orient loge in now-Greek Salonika. No wonder the infrastructure was in place by August 1914 in Erzerum for the Great Massacres, almost three months before Turkey entered the Great War. During World War I and ever since, Jews have held prominent positions in the Turkish government, including three presidents, Ataturk, Inonu, and Bayar. No known English translation exists of Rifat's book; however, it was translated into Armenian in 1939. Rifat seems to be a pro-Sultan nationalist Turk. I will agree with an author who said, The Donmeh showed great public affection with Islam but, amongst themselves, entirely rejected and even despised Islam. There is no need to say that they also, in secret, hated and despised the Christians of the Ottoman Empire despite the fact that some Armenians were masons and were part of the Young Turks' Committee of Union and Progress Party before the Genocide happened. The Donmeh believed that they were destined to take over the rulership of the Turkish Empire and modern Turkey that followed it, according to a prophecy given by Nathan Ghazzati, who was a close associate of the MASTER of deceptions and of deceivers, Sabbatai Zevi himself. S. Zevi can not be considered a real Jew, he was a Kabbalist, Sufist, Gnostic, Mystic, Occultist; Anti-Talmudist (or Talmud Revisionist), all mixed together in a strange cocktail that resulted in UNIMAGINABLE blood spilling and suffering for humanity. Yes, in that, sense, he was a true and real Anti-Christ. Barry Chamish, in his article The Deutsch Devils, says that Rabbi Antelman's focus is the false messiah Shabtai Zvi, and the continuation of his evil ministry through the Turkish sect called the Donmeh. In the eighteenth century, Jacob Frank brought the Donmeh ideology to Europe and joined a fateful alliance... Antelman wrote the two-volume work To Eliminate The Opiate. Jacob Frank, the second successor to S. Zevi, considered himself to be another messiah. He claimed to be an incarnation of the Jewish patriarch Jacob. He ordered his 13,000 followers to become Catholics and infiltrate the Catholic Church. He referred to the Catholic as the Esau, the brother of Biblical Jacob, and said it was time for a reconciliation between Jacob and Esau. However, his real motives were to deceive and, by deception, establish a Jewish anti-Christ kingdom in Palestine. After all, did not Jacob deceive Esau in the story of the Bible! And did not Sabbatai Zevi himself tell the Sultan and the Turks, when questioned by them about his reasons for keeping in close touch With the Jews after converting with some of his followers to Islam and adopting the name Aziz Mehemet, that his (Zevi's) aim was to convert the Jews to Islam, why telling those same Jews that his aim in becoming Muslim was in order to convert the Muslims to Judaism! In his book The Messianic Idea in Judaism, the Jewish professor Gershon Scholem (1971 edition, page 126) writes about Jacob Frank: In all his actions [he was] a truly corrupt and degenerate individual and as one of the most frightening phenomena in the whole of Jewish history. Dear reader, Please do not call the author of this article an anti-Semite; he will be the first to come to the help of any Jew whose life is in peril. Also, he is not a hate-monger, for his heart is full of love. He is not a liar; he will not lie deliberately or intentionally; he is an old man now whose father survived the Armenian Genocide 90 years ago and he is trying to find out what really happened, because JUSTICE on earth has not been done YET concerning the Armenian Genocide, and the issue will never die. It CANNOT be swept under the rug, as the Turks and their allies are trying to do.

"Yaroslav Trofimov, who was born in Ukraine, is a roving foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and the author of Faith at War: A Journey on the Frontlines of Islam, from Baghdad to Timbuktu (Henry Holt, May 2005; www.faithatwar.com). In 1990-1992 his free-lance articles were published in The Ukrainian Weekly; many of them were written for Rukh Press International. Mr. Trofimov will present his new book and share his experiences at 7 p.m. on May 18 at the Ukrainian Institute of America, 2 E. 79th St., New York. When I packed my bags to travel to Kyiv to cover Ukraine's Orange Revolution last fall, I took all the usual things that I've learned to bring on reporting trips: a satellite phone, a helmet and a bullet-proof vest. As a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, it's been my job since 2001 to hopscotch around the world, covering war and mayhem from Afghanistan to Iraq to Liberia. Used to things getting out of hand, I was bracing for a bloody showdown - this time in the city where I was born. Fellow reporters, some of whom I had last seen in Baghdad, were equally glum. Our opinion of human nature undermined by watching so much bloodletting up close, we instinctively feared that something would just go wrong. And indeed, it wouldn't have taken much - one trigger-happy policeman, one or two agents provocateurs - for the scenes of panic and pain to replace TV images of cheerful, dancing crowds on Independence Square. We all know, of course, how differently things in Ukraine turned out to be. Nobody was roughed up, let alone killed. My bulletproof vest never left the suitcase. The protest movement, spurred by a sense of wounded dignity, achieved tremendous results without spilling a drop of blood. For people like me, who had spent months in Baghdad, where the dead are usually counted by the dozen, this was little short of miracle. In a world caught in a spiral of violence, Ukraine offered an inspiring moment of hope. Soon, in Egypt, an opposition party adopted the orange scarves of the Ukrainian protests in its drive for more freedom. But, unlike authorities in Kyiv, the ones in Cairo responded by throwing the party's leader in jail. Then, in Beirut, the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri brought tens of thousands of Lebanese to demonstrate for free elections and an end to Syrian domination. (Just like many in Russia pretend that Ukraine is an abnormal formation that will be reabsorbed in the greater homeland one day, Syrians tend to think of Lebanon as an artificially separated part of Greater Syria; Syria even refuses to maintain an embassy in Beirut.) In downtown Beirut, at a student protesters' tent city that so much resembled the one on Kyiv's Independence Square, posters on a billboard showed the Ukrainian rallies. Instead of orange scarves, the Lebanese went for red and white - the colors of their national flag. The Syrians' most powerful ally in Beirut, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, understood the symbolism all too well. Unlike pro-Russian politicians in Kyiv, he managed to assemble his own giant, pro-Syrian rally in the heart of the Lebanese capital, bellowing from the balcony: Here, it is not Ukraine! And indeed it wasn't. Syrian troops may be gone now, but a pro-Syrian administration remains in charge in Beirut. And, unlike in Ukraine, the political crisis there - just as in the rest of the Middle East - is punctuated by deadly car bombings as sectarian tensions bubble up to the surface again. Blood all too often has to be washed off the streets. Many in Washington nowadays want to portray American efforts to revamp the Muslim world as something akin to the Cold War campaigns to end oppression in Eastern Europe; I have even heard U.S. officials mention Ukrainian and Iraqi elections in the same breath, as interconnected steps in a global march of freedom. This should be no surprise. Some of the very people in charge of combating the axis of evil today were actively fighting the evil empire back in the 1980s. Being a former citizen of that evil empire, it's hard to agree with such comparisons. I remember, as a teenager in the 1980s, listening furtively to U.S.-funded Radio Liberty, trying to make out forbidden words as a Soviet jammer whined siren-like on the same frequency. For people in the Soviet bloc, chafing under a totalitarian regime, America beckoned as a symbol of freedom and national liberation. It's precisely this fresh sense of gratitude that prompted so many countries in the so-called New Europe to send troops to help the U.S. in Iraq as the Old Europe giants of Germany and France watched from the sidelines. But, in the Muslim world, the opposite equation is now in place. While in Eastern Europe largely pro-American peoples lived under anti-American regimes, among Islamic lands anti-American fury is most widespread in American allies: Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan - and now, of course, Iraq. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, Communist societies crumbled from within as their public opinion defected to America's side. Nationalist feelings, directed against Moscow, helped bring about democracy from Warsaw to Tbilisi. How different from the Middle East! There, regimes have to pander to anti-American feelings to survive; being an Arab nationalist today almost by definition means being anti-American. If only Iraq were like Ukraine. If only one didn't have to wear a bulletproof vest every day in Baghdad. Article copyright The Ukrainian Weekly.","Trofimov, Yaroslav",Ukrainian Weekly,2005-05-15,1
"Those who attend the 40th anniversary banquet of The Armenian Reporter Int'l, which will be held on Saturday, June 25, 2005 at the Palisadium in nearby Cliffside Park, will not only celebrate a major milestone in the paper's life and honor its founder and senior editor, Edward K. Boghosian, but also have the rare opportunity to hear an address by Ambassador Edward P. Djerejian. As evidenced by the opening this week in Yerevan of the new U.S. embassy compound - the largest in Armenia's capital, the US-Armenia relationship is an important one to both countries. Likewise, the bonds between Americans of Armenian descent and native Armenians are quite strong and enduring. As such, Ambassador Djerejian's comments on improving the US-Armenia relationship and his views on the situation of Armenians in the Middle East and around the world should prove to be most interesting. Ambassador Djerejian, the founding Director of the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy at Rice University, is one of the United States' most distinguished diplomats, with his career spanning the administrations of eight U.S. Presidents. A leading expert on the complex political, security, economic, religious, and ethnic issues of the Middle East, Ambassador Djerejian has played key roles in the Arab-Israeli peace process, the U.S.-led coalition against Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, successful efforts to end the civil war in Lebanon, the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon, and the establishment of collective and bilateral security arrangements in the Persian Gulf. Prior to his nomination by President Clinton as United States Ambassador to Israel, Ambassador Djerejian served both President Bush and President Clinton as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs and President Reagan and President Bush as U.S. Ambassador to the Syrian Arab Republic. Ambassador Djerejian has also served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, as Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Press Secretary for Foreign Affairs in the White House, and as Deputy Chief of the U.S. mission to the Kingdom of Jordan. A Foreign Service officer since 1962, other assignments include political officer in Beirut, Lebanon, and Casablanca, Morocco, Consul General in Bordeaux, France, and he headed the political section in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during the critical period in U.S.-Soviet relations marked by the invasion of Afghanistan. Ambassador Djerejian served in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea following his graduation from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. He holds a Bachelor of Science, an Honorary Doctorate in Humanities from Georgetown University, and an Honorary Doctor of Laws, honoris causa, from Middlebury College, and is fluent in Arabic, Russian, French, and Armenian. Ambassador Djerejian has been awarded the Presidential Distinguished Service Award, the Department of State's Distinguished Honor Award, the President's Meritorious Service Award and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor. Ambassador Djerejian was asked by Secretary of State Colin Powell to chair a congressionally mandated Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy in the Arab and Muslim World.

"Kingdom of Heaven Starring Orlando Bloom, Liam Neeson, Ed Norton AN Irish actor. A big-budget historic drama. Spears. Horses. Massive battle scenes. Father/son conflict. Liam Neeson's new movie, Kingdom of Heaven, might bring on post-Alexander trauma, but it's not quite as bad as Colin Farrell's inadvertent disaster movie. Topping the U.S. box office with a $20 million take on its first weekend, Kingdom also seems resistant to the attacks from the media. The film focuses on Orlando Bloom, who plays a humble (here we go) blacksmith, who volunteers for the 12th century Crusades after he meets his estranged father, Godrey of Ibelin, played by Neeson. Bloom is haunted by the suicide of his wife, and hopes that he can find redemption for her through his fight for Christianity against the Muslims of the east. Luckily for Neeson's film career, his character dies on the long journey to Jerusalem, leaving Bloom to take his father's place, just as Colin Farrell's Alexander felt obliged to follow his father's legacy. So far, so ZZZZZ. He is welcomed to Jerusalem by King Baldwin (Edward Norton), a true-life figure who wore a mask to hide his leprosy. And of course, as always happens in these historic pieces, the hero transcends all class barriers and manages to bed a princess, here played by Eva Green. So he is a hero fighting for his wife's immortal legacy, but also a lothario who bags a Princess. Nice. But the steam is never allowed to rise too far before 12th century Christian politics gives us all a cold shower. Green's princess is married to a knight named Lusignan, who vies for power with his Knights Templar and the high minded Tiberius (played by Jeremy Irons). On top of all this, Saladin, the Muslim military leader outside the city, is vying for revenge for the horrendous slaughter of his people when the Christians first took Jerusalem. Yes, we have now reached Alexander or Troy levels of weighty political intrigue, which Hollywood movie studios think they can ram into the script to please pedantic history professors. So as not to lose the interest of the great unwashed, each one of these tortuous meeting or political arguments is sprinkled with pouty close ups of the hero (Colin Farrell, Orlando Bloom, Brad Pitt, take your pick) trying to looking meaningful and concerned. Prepare yourself, then, for the director's coup de grace. It's the Muslim speech. Director Ridley Scott wants us all to know that the Muslims are not the bad guys. It's done in such a heavy-handed, lecturing way that it loses all emotional impact, especially Bloom's weepy speech at the end. Neeson told the Irish Voice last year that Kingdom of Heaven would have modern parallels to the situation in the Middle East and, oh God, we are never allowed to forget the point. I don't know if Neeson wrote it into his contract to get killed before Bloom and his fellow Zoolander-style pouters reached Jerusalem. If he did, he made a wise move. Neeson's last big screen effort, Kinsey, was a fine movie. Now this comes along. Next up for Neeson is Batman Begins and the next Star Wars nerd-a-thon. It's going to be a long summer.

"Poland was plunged into indescribable bereavement when its favorite son, Pope John Paul II, died on April 2nd, 2005 at 9:37 p.m. (Central European Time). Poles taking part in round-the-clock prayer vigils across the country for the Holy Father's recovery were stunned and shocked when it was announced that former Kraków archbishop Karol Wojtyla had returned to the home of the Father. Those who heard the news on TV flocked to churches to pray with their compatriots for their Pontiff, spiritual leader and defender. We have lost the greatest Pole that ever lived. He brought us freedom, prestige and self-esteem and now he has left us. We are now orphans. What will become of us? Such was the initial reaction of most Poles. They brought flowers, lighted candles, recited rosaries and held hands in a symbolic gesture signifying the Pope's passage from this life to the next. It is as if Poland had lost its mother, because he looked after Poland as a mother looks after her Poland as a mother looks after her family, remarked former president Lech Walesa, a close friend of John Paul II who provided moral support for the peaceful Solidarity revolution that brought down communism in 1989. We all know that when a mother passes away, the family often breaks down and drifts apart. I hope that is not the case this time. A Polish-American woman interviewed in Brooklyn's heavily Polish Greenpoint section told a Polish TV reporter: His stature raised Polonia's position in America. Without him our community has lost its strong foundation. The rarely used 11-ton Zygmunt Bell of Kraków's medieval Wawel Cathedral, which announced Cardinal Wojtyla's election to the papacy in 1978 now tolled to mark his demise, as did church bells around the country. Polish and Vatican flags were flown at half-mast and flags draped with black crepe sprouted from lamp-posts, public buildings and the balconies and windows of private apartments. The government announced a period of national mourning, the electronic media abandoned normal programming and provided saturation coverage of papal events, talks with people who knew him personally and discussions on his 27-year pontificate, the third longest in history. Extensive documentary footage reminded Poles of their great compatriot's eight visits to Poland, including his last papal pilgrimage in 2002. Newspapers and magazines published special papal issues and parishes began organizing trips to the Pope's funeral on Friday, April 8th. SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS HOMELAND. Nobody in history has ever done more to upraise Poland's international significance than the former Archbishop Wojtyla who is already being called John Paul the Great (an adjective that only four popes in history have every enjoyed). Despite his ardent love of Poland, nobody could ever accuse the Polish-born Pontiff of being a chauvinist or even a nationalist. One measure of his greatness was his ability to easily reconcile patriotism with humanism because in everything he did he tried to live up to the term Catholic which means universal. That universality, his ability to empathize with people of all nationalities, races and creeds, made him an internationally acknowledged authority. That also brought recognition to the Polish nation, which had long been sidetracked as a result of half a century of totalitarian rule and centuries of subjugation by neighboring powers. His first pilgrimage to Poland in 1979 is widely regarded as the seed that eventually took root, grew and led to the collapse of the Soviet empire and ended the cold war. Speaking and ended the cold war. Speaking to a huge congregation in Warsaw's central square, John Paul II said: From the depths of Poland's 1,000-year history there comes the call: May Your Spirit Descend and Renew the earth. After a brief strategically spaced moment, he added: This earth, triggering thunderous applause. The pope's words gave the Polish people a new-found sense of self-esteem and dignity, inspiring them to challenge their communist rulers. The Solidarity union, the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union, which arose the following year, enabled the Polish people and other nations of central and eastern Europe to throw off the shackles of Soviet domination. A brilliant intellectual and towering moral authority, he never lost the common touch and won people's hearts with his compassion, warmth, accessibility and sense of humor. Walesa has repeatedly said the pope charged his spiritual batteries, and that applied to the overwhelming majority of his countrymen as well. But John Paul II also regenerated his own failing strength in his homeland which always welcomed him with unprecedented enthusiasm. Dzieku-je-my (we thank you) was regularly chanted by thousands in appreciation for the pope's passionate spiritual leadership and liberation from Soviet enslavement. Although he always had hard-hitting moral messages for his countrymen, his visits were peppered with lighter moments of good-natured fatherly banter. Outside his quarters in the Kraków's Archbishop's residence, he was regularly serenaded by young people with whom he joked and chatted from his upstairs window. The recollections of his youth in his hometown of Wadowice and the kremówki (cream cakes) with which he and his schoolmates celebrated their high-school graduation have become legendary. HOW IT ALL STARTED. To the conclave that elected him to be the 264th Pope on October 16th, 1978, the Kraków Archbishop brought with him 58 years of upbringing, personal tragedy, spiritual formation, academic studies and various life experiences under two totalitarian powers that had subjugated his native land. During his last visit to his hometown in Wadowice in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, the Holy Father told thousands of residents packed into the town square: This is where it all started. Life started, school started, theatrical activities started and the priesthood started. His childhood had been marked by tragedy. His mother Emilia (neé Kaczorowska) died when he was nine in 1929 and he was raised by his father, a tailor by trade, who served as an administrative officer in Austrian army and later, after Poland regained its independence. His brother Edmund, a physician, died of scarlet fever when Karol was 12. He was raised by his father, a devout Catholic who attached great important ace to both piety and military-style discipline. Lolek did well in school and was good at sports, especially soccer and skiing, but the was only a half-hearted altar boy. After graduating from high school in 1938, he and his father moved to Kraków, so Karol could enroll in philosophy studies the Jagiellonian University. A deep imprint on his spiritual formation was made by Jan Tyranowski, a profoundly religious tailor who introduced him to the writings of St. John of the Cross and St. Theresa of Avila. After the Nazis closed the university, Karol worked as a stone-cutter in a nearby quarry. Before his father died in 1941, he made Karol promise to commit his life to Christ, and the following year, he began clandestine studies for the priesthood. He also worked at a chemical factory. After World War II, he continued his theological studies and was ordained a priest in 1946. He was sent to study at pontifical universities in Rome and during summer vacations ministers to polish workers in France, Belgium and Holland. Returning to Poland in mid-1948, he did parish work in Kraków, continued his studies, was appointed to the Chair of Ethics at the Catholic University of Lublin in 1956 and ordained a bishop in 1958. As a professor he took his students on canoeing trips and hikes through the mountains as a rather unconventional way to help them mediate and deepen their faith. He was active in the work of the Second Vatican Council in Rome and made a name for himself in international Church circles for his dynamic leadership. At home, as Archbishop of Kraków, he often had to use psychology to outwit his country's officially atheistic communist authorities who tried to discourage church attendance, restrict celebrations of the Millennium of Poland's Baptism (1966) and refused building permits for much needed churches. Up till his election to the papacy, he traveled considerably around the globe, including visits to Polonian communities in North America, and took part in international Church events. RECORDED-SETTING GLOBAL PONTIFICATE. During his pontificate, John Paul II presided at nearly 200 beatification and canonization ceremonies, proclaiming 1,338 Blessed and elevating 482 to sainthood - more than any single pope in history. Despite views claiming that saints are something obsolete and medieval, the Holy Father felt that our confused and troubled times in particular needed positive role models, and that's all saints really are. No other Pope has encountered as come into contact with as many people as the Polish-born pontiff. An estimated more than 176,000,000 pilgrims took part in his Wednesday General Audiences. That does not include special audiences and religious ceremonies held (more than 8 million pilgrims during the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000 alone) and the millions of faithful he met during millions of faithful he met during pastoral visits in Italy and throughout the world. During his well over 100 visits to some 130 different countries he covered a distance of 720,000 miles, a distance three times that separating the earth from the moon, and delivered some 2,400 addresses and sermons. The Holy Father was fluent in seven languages, had a working knowledge of a dozen others and could correctly pronounce phonetically written texts in many more. He was the first pope to travel by helicopter, made wide use of the media to evangelize the world and had the Vatican computerized and linked to the Internet. Media representatives were first informed of the pope's death by SMS some 10 minutes before the official announcement was made in St. Peter's. That showed his Vatican's understanding of today's real-time broadcasts. Full live television coverage beamed the pope's wake and funeral into millions of homes around the globe. A COMPASSIONATE, HIGH-TECH PEOPLE'S POPE. Many, perhaps people who grow up in poverty tend to become arrogant and self-important once they achieve fame and luxury. Young Karol Wojtyla had a modest childhood and suffered deprivation under nazi occupation, but continued to side with the underprivileged after rising to prominence. During his university studies he joined a Catholic charity group. Edith Zierer, 74, a Holocaust survivor now living in Israel, recalled how she as a freezing, starving, lice-infested little Jewish girl was carried to safety under the noses of the Nazis by the then 20-some-year-old Wojtyla. Even in his early papal career, when he was still robust and athletic, he always bent over to comfort and hugs the sick, disabled and poor. Although branded a conservative by left-leaning critics worldwide, the Holy Father actually preached a radical philosophy of social justice opposed to today's greedy globalized capitalism with its wanton environmental destruction and soul-deadening commercial culture and consumer mentality. Unlike liberals who often oppose war and the death penalty and conservatives who don't but are against abortion and euthanasia, John Paul II had a profound respect for human life and consistently opposed all forms of killing. He was criticized as being out of step with the times for upholding traditional Church teachings on divorce, premarital and extramarital sex, homosexual marriages and women priests. That position stemmed not only form religious doctrine but also his deep conviction that such innovations would ultimately further undermine today's already quite unstable family, society's quite unstable family, society's basic unit. He urged us to ask ourselves the question: Would things in our already confused and hectic world get better if we had even more divorces, extramarital sex and children born out of wedlock not knowing who there fathers are, more greedy, selfish people obsessed with careers, pleasures and creature comforts? Would Christianity really improve with the introduction of homosexual and/or lesbian priests and other innovations being pushed by today's loudly publicized narrow-agenda radicals? Would a conservative have done so much to promote world peace and bring together people of diverse religions, cultures and ethnic backgrounds? John Paul II was the first pope to pray in a synagogue an at Jerusalem's Wailing Wall and visit a Muslim mosque. He annulled the excommunication of Martin Luther and sought to heal age-old rifts with eastern Orthodoxy. The Polish-born pontiff inspired ecumenical dialogue with Polonia's own Polish National catholic Church, which wiped out the excommunication of its organizer Bishop Franciszek Hodur and reaffirmed the validity of the PNCC's sacraments. An unprecedented occurrence were the prayers for world peace in Assisi to which he invited Christians, Jews, Moslems, Buddhists, Hindus, Scientists, Animists and others. The Holy Father's greatest unfulfilled hope was his desire to make a pilgrimage to Russia and seek reconciliation with that country's Eastern Orthodox Church. He visited various Orthodox countries, but Russia's Orthodox Patriarch Alexei II made such a visit impossible in fear of losing some of its followers to Catholicism. Translator Maria Irena Derkacz, 58, of Warsaw explained how she viewed the secret of his charisma: He loved Poland but was truly universal. He spoke out on every major ill afflicting today's world and always sided with the poor, suffering and downtrodden. Everywhere he went he displayed supreme respect for the nations he was visiting. He fell to his knees and kissed their native soil, he spoke their language and canonized their saints. When he visited Lourdes already as an elderly man, he chose to stay in a hospice with other patients rather than live in the bishops' palace. He was the people's pope, warm, approachable with a sense of humor. He was a human pope that turned the papacy from a remote and lofty office into something close, hospitable and familiar. And his powerful sense of mission and determination to serve to the very end is an example to others who are suffering. He served God and man throughout his lifetime and he kept on serving during his agony as well as in death. Article copyright Polish American Journal.

"Metropolitan-Archbishop Stefan Soroka is the primate of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in the United States. The heartfelt prayers of gratitude of the hierarchy, clergy, religious and faithful of the Ukrainian Catholic Church in the U.S.A. were humbly offered by me in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome at the side of the place where the body of our beloved Pope John Paul II lay in state. I had the privilege of remaining for over half an hour to offer prayers to almighty God for the soul of this great spiritual shepherd of the Catholic Church and of the world. Over 2 million people passed by his earthly remains, often waiting between 13 and 24 hours to prayerfully give respect. Among them were numerous sick and handicapped people, and the vast majority were youth, and young men and women. My visit was concluded by participating in a joint visit with the president of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, accompanied by his wife, our Patriarch, Lubomyr Husar, and other Ukrainian dignitaries. The funeral of our beloved holy father was most solemn and prayerful. Between 3 million and 4 million people descended upon the city of Rome, mostly youth. All transportation by car or bus in the inner city of Rome was forbidden on the day of the funeral to accommodate the crowds of people and for security reasons. That morning I walked over six miles amidst the pilgrims to St. Peter's Basilica and witnessed the devotion and respect of these young people for the holy father. This was again evident during the funeral at St. Peter's Basilica and at the many sites throughout Rome organized to accommodate the millions of mourners. Police and city workers of Rome were present everywhere, providing assistance to the visitors, including bottles of water and medical attention as needed. Thousands slept overnight in the parks and on the streets. Most carried sleeping and overnight bags. Yet, despite the huge crowds, all progressed peacefully and without incident. They were there to pay homage to a special person who had great spiritual influence in their lives. All shared in gratitude and praise to God for the service and leadership of Pope John Paul II of the Catholic Church and in the world. The front steps of St. Peter's Basilica was filled with cardinals and bishops of the Catholic Church, presidents, prime ministers, royalty and leaders of almost every nation in the world, as well as, representatives of all major faiths in the world. How harmonious it appeared to see Jewish rabbis sitting alongside Muslim clerics, and others of different faiths. Pope John Paul II, during his pontificate, visited the leaders and people of over 130 countries and reached out to the leaders of the world's major religions. The result of his attempts to generate harmony and mutual understanding was now well evident by the representation at the holy father's funeral. The sung funeral prayers and the celebration of the holy mass for the soul of Pope John Paul II were peaceful and most prayerful, typical of the celebrations by the holy father throughout his pontificate. A panakhyda service in Greek and Arabic was celebrated by the patriarchs and hierarchy of the Eastern Catholic Churches, as has become traditional for the funeral of departed popes. Significantly more notable was the huge representation of members of the Orthodox Churches, including Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople. Pope John Paul II emphasized that the Church breathes with two lungs, both East and West, thus elevating the dignity of the Eastern Churches in the universal Church. Our Ukrainian Catholic Church was privileged to have both our Patriarch Husar and myself participating in these concluding prayers offered by the Eastern Catholic Churches. Our beloved Pope John Paul II has left numerous encyclicals and writings on numerous topics. A significant spiritual treasure chest of teachings is available for all of us to study, to learn from. Of particular significance for us of the Eastern Churches is the holy father's emphasis on the Church breathing with two lungs, East and West. Pope John Paul II's emphasis on this broadened the understanding and perspective of the Western Church and awakened us to the importance of Eastern Churches being loyal to our traditions. It now becomes even more imperative for the Eastern Churches to continue to keep alive this emphasis of Pope John Paul II amidst our brothers and sisters in the Western Church and amidst ourselves in the Eastern Churches. Our Ukrainian Catholic Church, through its Synod of Bishops, must devote itself to the discernment of our identity as an Eastern Church and the traditions that properly reflect this identity. We pray and we commit ourselves to this endeavor, being ever grateful for the gift of Pope John Paul II's emphasis that the Church breathes with two lungs, East and West. In appreciation of this gift, let us all ensure that both lungs breathe with full vigor and life in the Risen Christ. Let us continue to pray for the soul of our beloved Pope John Paul II, and for the holy discernment by the cardinals of the next spiritual shepherd for our universal Catholic Church and for the world. Christ is risen! Article copyright The Ukrainian Weekly.","Soroka, Metropolitan Stefan",Ukrainian Weekly,2005-04-17,1
"Some Turkish students at one of the universities that I frequent, who read this column, asked me why I use Turks and Ottomans interchangeably. I replied that I would desist from the dual usage when Turkish nationalism and the governments of Turkey show that they are different from the Ottomans. Not that there is one-to-one correlation. However, I find it very difficult to see a difference in the spiritual outlook. There is the almost identical paranoid outlook on the entire world and life, a visceral distrust of anyone and anything that is not Turk, a grandiose self-infatuation, a propensity to lie when the truth is more appropriate, and the attempt to rely upon force and intimidation as the main tool of diplomacy. MYTH OF EQUALITY The myth about the equality that reigned in the lands under the Ottomans holds true to this day. The Dhimmini laws were as rigid at keeping all folks not of the Muslim faith second-class citizens as the Jim Crow laws were at keeping African-Americans in a separate but not equal class. Today the Turkish government mocks the minorities with a few fanciful speeches by the prime minister but still requires them to genuflect to get a window changed in a church or synagogue, or to speak on the radio for a few minutes in an ethnic language other than Turkish. The minorities still do not dare to teach their own versions of history or to teach courses and major in a language of their choosing in minority schools. The current government laughs at the Christian heads of churches and uses them for political purposes. Religious leaders must be born in Turkey, and at the same time the government keeps the only Christian seminary closed. Unless insurances are in place before Turkey enters the European Union, it is highly feasible that Christian clergy trained outside of Turkey will not be allowed to practice inside Turkey. Obviously, this would begin the destruction of the Christian faith in Turkey without the use of the scimitar. Concomitant with all this bias against Christians, there is an escalating tolerance of the shift to increased Moslem awareness, if one chooses to believe that there ever was a diminution of Islamic belief. CHANGES IN LATIN NAMES OF ANIMALS It is not solely the destruction of the Christian clergy that is taking place. The sick minds that run Ankara cannot even bear to see that some animals' Latin names in their lands refer to Armenians and Kurds. The paranoid minds associate the names to schemes to break up Anatolia into Kurdish and Armenian lands. If the following does not indicate that a whole crew of Turks belongs on Vamik Volkan's couch for psychiatric analysis, no folks should go. Turkish authorities decided to change the name of a red fox known as Vulpes Vulpes Kurdistanica simply to Vulpes Vulpes, eliminating Kurdistanica. A species of wild sheep called Ovis Armeniana will be shorn of its Armenian reference and changed to Ovis Orientalis Anatolicus. A type of deer known as Capreolus Capreolus Armenus is renamed Capreolus Cuprelus Capreolus. The director of Turkish National Parks and Wildlife, Prof. [Mustafa] Kemal Yalinkilic, said that these wild animals have been renamed in the interest of the country. At present strange games are being played against our [Turkey] country. Some people are using the names of species of our fauna in order to stress that Kurds and Armenians used to live here. By changing the names of these species, we will put an end to these games, the professor said. I wonder if it is possible to bring charges of disrespect against the professor for daring to carry the name Mustafa Kemal in front of his surname. After all, the saint is the one and only, and using the logic for changing the names of the animals, the professor may be attempting to imply that he is as great as the founder of the Turkish republic. I wonder if our captured kinfolk residing in Istanbul think that they are free enough to challenge this laughable, if it were not so pathetic, insult and attack against Armenians and Kurds. 99% OF POPULATION IN FEAR OF REMAINING 1% This is simply another maligned tactic in the violence of denial to ensure that the historians who follow Mesrob Mutafyan's admonition in agreement with his Prime Minister that history should be left up to historians are hoodwinked. Tell me, folks, is changing these names a scholarly or political move? What about cleansing the archives in Turkey that Mr. Erdogan is so anxious for historians to visit? By the way, he keeps admonishing the Armenians for allegedly keeping the archives in Yerevan closed to outsiders, when it was publicly announced that there are over 50,000 documents relative to the Genocide that all researchers are welcome to investigate. Even the well-known Ali Birand recently wrote an article asking his fellow Turks why 60 million Moslem Turks fear others that make up about 1 percent of the population. He wondered if his fellow Moslems thought that the minority is about to change 60 million Moslems to another faith or belief. The reason for the article by Mr. Birand was the inability to move the foundations law into being. This is a law that will legally acknowledge the lands willed to or purchased by the Armenian, Greek, Jewish, and other minority religious foundations. As I previously stated, and recently repeated by Mr. Birand, right now the non-Moslems cannot even place a new nail into a board or reseat an old nail coming out of a religious structure without having to kiss the hand of a Turkish official. This is the freedom that some of our Armenian brethren captured in Istanbul argue is just, when even a Moslem Turk writer thinks it is a disgrace. CELEBRATING INT'L WOMEN'S DAY TURKISH STYLE On March 8, the world celebrated International Women's Day. In every civilized society the fine attributes of women and their contributions to the world were hailed by national leaders. Turkey celebrated the women's rally in a slightly different manner. The thugs called police were set loose on the women, swinging batons and sticks and inflicting savage beatings on the females. PM Erdogan promised to look into the reason for this brutal response to a peaceful march. But Turkish leaders are long on promises and short on delivery, just as recent members of the EU stated about Turkey having come almost to a halt in improvements required to satisfy entry into the EU. The EU and many Westerners see that more than changes in law are essential for Turkey to be Western European. Turkey needs a cultural renaissance. This takes time and a willingness to change. Up to this point, the Troglodytes that run Turkey think that Europe has to change for them. And these are the type of folks that some people want to allow into the EU, as is. Fortunately, countries such as France, Austria, Netherlands, and a great number of Germans see it increasingly differently. Perhaps the U.S. and its buddy at 10 Downing Street, Tony Blair, will soon understand that, in too many instances, we are what we were then unless a drastic overhaul takes place. That overhaul is not likely to take place in Turkey once they are a member. Acceptance as a full member has to be the impetus for change.

"The differences between the alleged Armenian genocide of the World War I era and the Holocaust are overwhelming, something akin to the legal chasm between first-degree murder and negligent homicide. To equate the two would be to vitiate the moral stigma that should attach to the crime of crimes, and to violate the rule of law itself. Under international law, genocide is carefully defined as the specifically intended extermination, in whole or in part, of a racial, ethnic, or religious group because of their identity as such. Under the Ottoman Empire, Armenians were a favored, not disfavored, religious minority. The millet system granted them unprecedented local autonomy. Further, many Armenians rose to the commanding heights of the Ottoman civil service and economy, with an Armenian serving as the Sultan's Foreign Minister in the late 19th century. In the decades before World War I, when nationalistic impulses were surging, Armenian extremists sought to provoke the Ottomans into retaliatory action by chronic acts of terrorism, a model that worked well against the Ottomans in Bulgaria. Armenians themselves openly acknowledged this malevolent plotting. When World War I arrived, Ottoman Armenians defected en masse to fight for the Empire's enemies, especially Russia. Others remained behind to serve as Fifth Columnists or saboteurs. The Armenians boasted of their perfidy at the post-World War I Paris Peace Conference to justify their demand for a separate nation. The Armenian treason is well documented by Armenian sources, especially in the memoirs of Boghos Nubarian. The massive Armenian alliance with the Empire's enemies ignited a cycle of massacre and counter-massacre. As self-preservation is the first law of nations, in 1915 Ottoman officials ordered the relocation of its politically suspect Armenian population then living in militarily sensitive zones to its territory now known as Syria. Armenians in Istanbul and elsewhere outside these national security areas were left generally undisturbed. The relocation enterprise proved grim. The Empire's food and medical resources were thin for all the population. Armenian casualties from starvation, disease, and Ottoman Muslim killings were painfully high, perhaps 300,000-600,000. Similarly, at the end of the War and its aftermath, Muslim casualties at the hands of Armenians and their allies approximated 2.5 million. The Armenian figure, though lower in absolute numbers, constitutes a substantially greater portion of the original Armenian population. The tragic Armenian losses and suffering deserve sympathy and commemoration, but no more so than their Ottoman Muslim counterparts. One innocent life is not worth more than another's in the eyes of God. After the Ottoman defeat, the British occupied Istanbul and commanded full access to Ottoman Archives. Under the 1920 Treaty of Sevres, they were tasked to prosecute Ottoman officials guilty of Armenian massacres. More than 100 suspects were detained on Malta as a meticulous investigation ensued. After more than two years of exhaustive inquiry, Britain's highest legal experts advised against any prosecutions because want of reliable evidence. The detainees were thus released. No Ottoman official was either prosecuted or convicted of complicity in Armenian massacres in a court with the trappings of due process. The post-World War I Ottoman Government was completely dependent upon the victorious Allied Powers, who then occupied the remnants of the Ottoman Empire. This government established ersatz courts to try its political enemies. Included were trials on charges such as outrages to Armenians. With almost no presentation of evidence, the courts found nearly every defendant guilty as charged. 1,376 individuals were sentenced to varying degrees of punishment for offenses ranging from violations of military order, such as leaving a post without permission to failing to properly carry out the order under which the Ottoman Armenians of eastern Anatolia were relocated. No charges of crimes against humanity were raised or sustained. According to trial transcripts, the convictions were mainly political retribution, aimed at those who brought the Ottoman Empire into such a disastrous war. Sixty-two officials were sentenced to death and executed. Six officials, members of the Union and Progress Party, were tried in absentia and four were sentenced to death. Armenians eventually assassinated some of those tried in absentia. Though these courts provided little due process, this does not mean that no Ottoman Muslims committed crimes against Ottoman Armenians or that no Ottoman Armenians committed crimes against Ottoman Muslims. But one must acknowledge that the Ottoman government brought to trial over 1,400 individuals for crimes against Armenians and executed some that were guilty of high crimes, while on the other hand, neither the Armenian nation nor Armenian guerrilla groups ever charged, disciplined, or prosecuted their own for equally gruesome and notorious crimes against Ottoman Muslims. Indeed, the perpetrators were characteristically treated as heroes! They still are. The differences between the Holocaust and the alleged Armenian genocide are cosmic. The Ottomans relocated Armenians because of suspect political loyalties, not because of race or religion. They were thus left undisturbed outside militarily sensitive areas. Hitler exterminated Jews precisely because of their race, not because of suspect political allegiance. Indeed, many had been highly decorated German soldiers in World War I. None were treasonous as World War II unfolded. But all were selected for the gas chambers or worse. Killings during wartime for political reasons are not genocide; otherwise, war itself would be defined as genocide and the American fire and atomic bombings of Tokyo, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki would have exposed United States President Harry Truman to a genocide prosecution. In sum, the Armenian tragedy of World War I falls miles short of genocide because it pivoted on Ottoman political-national security calculations, not on racial or religious hatred. Further, Armenian deaths were not specifically intended, but were the unfortunate fall-out of malnutrition, pestilence, and community retaliator vendettas. Indeed, the Ottoman government prosecuted more than 1,400 for maltreatment of Armenians. Hitler, in contrast, prosecuted Germans for refusing to kill, maim, or maltreat Jews. Evidence proffered to support the Armenian genocide claim is unpersuasive. Ambassador Morgenthau's Story is routinely adduced as the smoking gun. But his narrative is almost entirely hearsay and his veracity highly suspect. His chief translator and secretary were both Armenian, Arshag Schmavonian and Hagop Andonian, respectively. Further, Morgenthau's correspondence with President Woodrow Wilson betrays an intent to contrive news, such as asserted Ottoman villainies, that would prod the United States into war. Moreover, Morgenthau unapologetically preached the racial inferiority of the Turks cursed with inferior blood. Would you trust the Ku Klux Klan to provide reliable accounts of black behavior in the United States? Morgenthau's storyline also fails to substantiate a racial, ethnic, or religious as opposed to a political motivation for the actions Of Ottoman officials. He writes, for example: That the Armenians all over Turkey sympathized with the Entente was no secret. 'If you want to know how the war is going,' wrote a humorous Turkish newspaper, 'all you need to do is look in the face of an Armenian. If he is smiling, then the Allies are winning; if he is downcast, then the Germans are successful.' If Ambassador Morgenthau's evidence were convincing, the twin decisions of the United States not to declare war on the Ottoman Empire and not to assume a League of Nations protectorate over a post-World War I Armenian state seem inexplicable. Morgenthau's story is also undercut by United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing's observation in November 1916: I could see that [the Armenians'] well-known disloyalty to the Ottoman Government and the fact that the territory which they inhabited was within the zone of military operations constituted grounds more or less justifiable for compelling them to depart their homes. United States Ambassador to Turkey, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol, wrote on March 28, 1921: I see that reports are being freely circulated in the United States that the Turks massacred thousands of Armenians in the Caucuses [Caucasus]. Such reports are repeated so many times it makes my blood boil. The Near East Relief has the reports from Yarrow and our own American people which show absolutely that such Armenian reports are absolutely false. The United Nations Economic and Social Council Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities refused to endorse an Armenian genocide assertion leveled by Special Rapporteur Benjamin Whitaker for want of proof. That non-endorsement was reaffirmed by the United Nations on October 5, 2000. The post-World War II Nuremberg Tribunal refused to entertain as evidence a quote attributed to Adolph Hitler on the eve of his Polish invasion asking who remembers the extermination of the Armenians. The attribution is no more reliable than the fraudulent Protocols of the Elders of Zion, as Princeton Professor Heath W. Lowry concludes in his authoritative booklet, The U.S. Congress and Adolph Hitler on the Armenians. Morgenthau's story is further dubious because, as United States Senator Hiram Johnson fretted, truth is the first casualty of war. Thus, the British-created Bryce Commission after World War I concluded that reports of countless rapes of Belgian women and gruesome killings of children by German soldiers were apocryphal wartime propaganda calculated to stir public wrath against the enemy. Isn't at least substantially likely that Ambassador Morgenthau succumbed to a corresponding reporting disease regarding the Ottomans? Morgenthau's story is also disputed by esteemed historians with no Ottoman or Turkish axe to grind, such as William Langer, Stanford Shaw, Bernard Lewis, and Justin McCarthy. Commander Arthur Tremaine Chester, the Representative of the U.S. Shipping Board in Istanbul, wrote in the New York Times History Journal in February 1923 a powerful refutation of the Armenian genocide claim that should shake the confidence of even its strongest proponents: We hear a great deal about the deportation of Armenians from the Northeast of Turkey during the World War. The facts are that the Turks sent an army to the Russian border to defend their country against the threatened Russian invasion. The army consisted of Turkish subjects of all nationalities, being drafted just as ours are drafted. At the front the Armenians used blank cartridges and deserted in droves. This was bad enough, but the Armenians were not satisfied with this form of treachery. The provinces in the rear of the army had a large Armenian population, and these people, feeling that there was an excellent chance of the Russians defeating the Turks, decided to make it a certainty by rising up in the rear of the army and cutting it off from its base of supplies. Let me draw a parallel imaginary case. Suppose that Mexico was a powerful and rival country with which we were at war, and suppose we sent an army to the Mexican border to hold back the invading enemy; suppose further that not only the negroes [sic] in our army deserted...but those left at home organized and cut off our line of communication. What do you think we as a people, especially the Southerners, would do to the negroes [sic]? Our negroes [sic] have ten times the excuse for hating whites than the Armenians have for their attitude toward the Turks. They have no representation, although they have an overwhelming majority in large sections of the South, and have nothing to say in the making or administration of the laws under which they are governed. South of the Mason and Dixon line, they are practically a subject race, while the Armenians in Turkey have not only full representation but special privileges not accorded by any other country. Genocide charges are too important to be addressed by sloppy or careless history or political manipulations.

"Were the plans of the 1915-23 Armenian Genocide actually drawn up and were they in place by the year 1910 or 1912? According to some unorthodox sources, definitely yes. There is the book Inner Folds of the Ottoman Revolution written by Mevlan Zadeh Rifat and published in 1929, in which the author, a pro-sultan Turk, claims that the Armenian genocide was decided in August 1910 and October 1911, by a Young Turk committee composed entirely of displaced Balkan Jews in the format of a syncretistic Jewish-Muslim sect, which included Talaat, Enver, Behaeddin Shakir, Jemal, and Nizam posting as Muslims. It met in the Rothschild-funded Grand Orient loge/hotel of Salonika. Syncretism means a combination of different forms of belief or practice. A 1994 conference paper/lecture by Joseph Brewda of Schiller Institute entitled Palmerson launches Young Turks to permanently control Middle East claims the founder of the Young Turks to be a certain Jew by the name of Emmanuel Carasso. He states: Carasso set up the Young Turk secret society in the 1890s in Salonika, then part of Turkey, and now part of Greece. Carasso was also the grand master of an Italian Masonic lodge there, called 'Macedonia Resurrected.' The lodge was the headquarters of the Young Turks, and all the top Young Turk leadership were members. Further on, Mr. Brewda says: During the Young Turk regime, Carasso continued to play a leading role. He met with the sultan, to tell him that he was overthrown. He was in charge of putting the sultan under house arrest. He ran the Young Turk intelligence network in the Balkans. And he was in charge of all food supplies in the empire during World War I. Another important area was the press. While in power, the Young Turks ran several newspapers, including The Young Turk, whose editor was none other than the Russian Zionist leader Vladimir Jabotinsky. Jabotinsky had been educated as a young man in Italy. Mr. Brewda writes about Talaat: Of course, there were also some Turks who helped lead the Young Turk movement. For example, Talaat Pasha. Talaat was the interior minister and dictator of the regime during World War I. He had been a member of Carasso's Italian Masonic lodge in Salonica. One year prior to the 1908 coup, Talaat became the grand master of the Scottish Rite Masons in the Ottoman Empire. If you go to the [archives of] Scottish Rite headquarters in Washington, D.C., you can find that most of the Young Turk leaders were officials in the Scottish Rite. Mr. Brewda also mentions the novel Greenmantle, whose hero is a British spy who led the Young Turks, and that the book's author, John Buchan, later identified the novel's hero as the English nobleman Aubrey Herbert, who was the top British spy master in the Middle East during WWI. And that Lawrence of Arabia later identified Herbert as having been, at one time, the head of the Young Turks. According to Mr. Brewda, Carasso also appears in that novel under the name Carasso. By 1916 the British and French, overpowered by greed, already had a secret agreement to divide the Ottoman Empire between them. Talaat was a living witness to the Genocide and should not have been assassinated. His silencing for good by hot-tempered Armenians only served those who planned and executed the Genocide. Had he been left alone, who knows, he might have confessed everything in his old age or at his deathbed. Another conspiratorial source is the lengthy article The Armenian & Jewish Genocide Project: Eliminating Ethnic Conflict Along the Oil Route From Baku to the Suez Canal Region, written by Clifford Shack and posted on his web site. Mr. Shack writes: In the 1880's, the French branch of the Rothschild family acquired interests in Russia's Baku oil fields in an effort to supply their refinery on the Adriatic with cheap Russian oil. In exchange for these interests, they built a railroad linking Baku to the newly acquired Black Sea port of Batum. This opened up the Baku oil, a major world supply, to the world. With the success of the new railroad, the Rothschilds had more oil than they could actually sell. Overcoming their fear of competing with the giant Standard Oil [of USA], they sought out the huge [Far East] markets east of Suez. Further on, Mr. Shack makes his point: The decision by the shrewd French Rothschild branch to diversify into other areas of oil exploitation was, presumably, a calculated one. Three years after they joined Royal Dutch, production at Baku would come to an abrupt halt in 1905. Although shaken by political activity, the principal disruption was due to the violence of the ethnic conflict between the region's Muslims and the minority population of Armenians who are Christians. This ethnic conflict caused the first interruption of oil distribution to the world market. Standard Oil was quick to supplant the needs of the effected markets as its source was operating under the blanket of peace. The Royal/Dutch/Shell Group (and the Nobles) watched their Baku investments go up in flames. Ethnic conflict was at the root of the matter. It could be safely assumed that they were taking measures to eliminate the possibility of that happening in the future. Oil corporations seem to have learned their lessons from history because, before the construction of the present-day Baku-Ceyhan pipeline began, someone made sure that no Armenians were left in Baku anymore. Mr. Shack notes, The mere elimination of the Armenian population of Baku would not solve the problem of ethnic conflict in that region. The surrounding areas would provide reservoir effect in resupplying the conflicting minority element, And he asks: Was the removal of a small minority like the Armenians [from historical Armenia] a fair price to pay for the peace in a region so crucial to the development and investment of the Far East? Apparently Mr. Shack ignores the factor of revenge raging in the heart of human beasts? Mr. Shack's answers his own question in his article by stating about the big businesses or big corporations: It would be fair to say that the genocide of a group of a million or so, to serve the benefit of a billion or so [in the Far East], is less of a question of should it be done, than how it could be done. So as not to reveal any plausible motive which could link the actual planners to the genocide, the scheme involved a proxy party [namely the Muslim Turks, Kurds and Azeris], which was manipulated through layers of influence, providing sufficient cover for the planners. The fool said in his ignorance, There was no planned and organized and executed genocide of the Armenians.

"It took oil tycoon and philantrophist John D. Rockefeller more than 30 years of wheeling and dealing to become America's first billionaire. Ukraine's current billionaires did it in half the time. Dollars were worth more in Mr. Rockefeller's time, of course, but still ... According to a recent special issue of Forbes magazine, Ukraine's current crop of billionaires achieved their wealth during what can be described as Kuchma's Great Giveaway, euphemistically called privatization. While most Ukrainians welcomed the collapse of the Soviet Union as an opportunity to give life to a new state, a new identity, and a reborn Ukrainian language, other denizens of Ukraine viewed the new Ukrainian state as a chicken waiting to be plucked, booty there for the taking. The richest man in Ukraine today is Rynat Akhmetov, 38. Worth an estimated $2.4 billion, a practicing Muslim whose father was a coal miner, Mr. Akhmetov enjoyed the backing of such powerful patrons as failed presidential candidate Viktor Yanukovych and oligarch Akhat Bragin, whose assets Mr. Akhmetov inherited after Mr. Bragin was murdered. Today, according to Forbes, Mr. Akhmetov's company, System Capital Management, controls Azosstal, Ukraine's third largest steel company, coal interests worth $400 million, and shares in a brewery, a newspaper and a mobile phone company. An attempt by Mr. Akhmetov and Viktor Pinchuk, Mr. Kuchma's billionaire son-in-law, to take over Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine's leading steel company with a winning but outrageously low bid of $800 million was recently reversed by a Kyiv court which ruled that the Kryvorizhstal bid fell short by at least $500 million. Nice try but no cigar. Mr. Pinchuk, 44, president of Interpipe, a producer of steel pipes and railway wheels, comes from a Jewish family in eastern Ukraine and claims to have earned a doctorate in technical science from Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute. Enjoying a net worth of $1.3 billion, he is married to Leonid Kuchma's daughter since 2002, holds many patents for pipe design, and claims to have used Interpipe cash to buy steel company assets during a time when politically connected oligarchs became millionaires almost overnight. Having wined and dined George H.W. Bush in Ukraine during the past presidential campaign, Mr. Pinchuk has international ambitions, according to Forbes. Always a shady character, he has hired the American firm of Ernst and Young to burnish his image in order to legitimize his holdings. Recently it was reported that Mr. Pinchuk will be teaming up with Hollywood film-maker Steven Spielberg to produce a documentary on the Nazi massacre at Babyn Yar in 1941. Some Ukrainian cynics in North America fear the film will downplay the number of Ukrainians massacred at that infamous site, and portray Ukrainian nationalists as anti-Semites who, in the words of Simon Wiesenthal himself, were worse than the Germans. Serhii Taruta, 50, is another Soviet-era apparatchik who benefited from privatization in Ukraine. Joining forces with Mr. Akmetov, Mr. Taruta used his position as director of Azovstal to create a coal, steel and energy conglomerate. Swapping assets with System Capital Assets, Mr. Taruta realized a cash windfall that enabled him to invest in a Hungarian metallurgical plant, an Uzbeki oil-and-gas processing plant, and a Russian engineering company. He has recently made bids for steel mills in the Czech Republic and Poland. In an article titled Man of Steel, authored by Heidi Brown and Nathan Vardi in the same issue of Forbes, the most interesting billionaire operating in Ukraine today seems to be Alex Shnaider, 36. He has a net worth of $1.4 billion, most of which, according to the article, comes from trading Ukrainian steel and grabbing control of that country's largest steel mill, Zaporizhstal. His holding company, Midland Resources, registered in the British tax haven of Guernsey, includes a power grid in Armenia; two hotels, a bakery chain and a meat-packing company in Serbia; small interests in Turkey and Israel; a Russian steel mill in Volgograd; and an ornate office building and casino in Moscow's Arbat pedestrian mall. Born in St. Petersburg, Mr. Shnaider and his family moved to Ukraine, then to Israel, finally reaching Toronto when Alex was 13. After helping his parents run a Jewish deli, he eventually completed a degree in economics at York University. As the Soviet Union collapsed, write the authors, Mr. Shnaider left to work for a steel-trading house in Zurich before setting up his own in Belgium ... Knowing nothing about how to move steel, Shnaider hung out at Ukrainian mills and made deals with desperate managers ... It was a dangerous business; at least seven steel executives were assassinated in Ukraine in the 1990s. John D. Rockefeller was eventually forced by the federal government to divest himself of what some considered to be a cartel (at the height of his power he controlled some 90 percent of the U.S. oil industry) during America's trust-busting era. The Standard Oil Co. was eventually divided into three companies. Called a robber baron, he was neither; he never robbed anyone and he was certainly not a baron. Rockefeller discovered oil and created wealth by producing it cheaper, permitting American families to have their oil lamps burning longer into the night. Leisure time was increased for the average American family. Are Ukraine's current crop of billionaire robber barons? Let's see. Did they rob? Many people in Ukraine believe they did. Are they barons? If political connections to the ruling elite makes one a baron then the four billionaires above certainly qualify. Will some of them eventually turn their talents to philantrophy, following in the footsteps of Americans John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie and Henry Ford? It would be nice. What will happen to Ukraine's robber barons in the short term? No one knows. They are clever and not easily intimidated. The Yushchenko administration is investigating their past and present activities, and already we hear that certain deals are being made. For some Ukrainians, this is the first big test for Ukraine's new president. Myron Kuropas's e-mail address is: kuropas@comcast.net.

"Photo Exhibit at the Italian American Museum March 1-April 15, 2005 The Italian American Museum and the John D, Calandra Italian American Institute/Queens College, The City University of New York, will present a new exhibition, Something Borrowed, Something New: Italian Women's Immigration Post World War II, a photography exhibition by Jessica Chornesky, from March 1 through April 15, 2005. The opening reception will be held on Tuesday, March 1st at 6 p.m. The artist will give a talk at the Museum on Thursday, March 3 at 6p.m. Ms. Chornesky's latest project, Something Borrowed, Something New, uses photography and oral histories to explore Italian immigration to the United States from a uniquely female perspective. In the decades following World War II, women have immigrated with their relatives or alone. They have come hoping to find better opportunities for their families as well as for themselves. Through photography and oral histories, the artist, documents and compares the Italian women who immigrated to the United States after World War II to their female counterparts (primarily sisters and cousins) who stayed in Italy. Ms. Chornesky highlights the images and voices of these immigrant women and brings to light a fuller picture of how immigration has affected their lives Throughout 2003 and 2004, Chornesky interviewed Italian American women about their immigration experience as well as their perspectives on such subject as money, power, sex and work. She also traveled throughout Sicily and Southern Italy to meet and document their sisters and cousins in the same fashion. Italian American women and their contributions to the Italian American immigrant experience have been largely unexplored and greatly under represented. Something Borrowed, Something New uses art to challenge traditional ideas and biases and to put forth a refreshing perspective on an often-stereotyped population. Chornesky's work has appeared in numerous publications including Time magazine, The New York Times, Elle, The Los Angeles Times, and Rolling Stone. Her photography has also been published in LA Latino: The Cultures of Everyday Life (Sage Press). Her previous exhibit, 70UP Women: New images of Aging, debuted at the Museum of the City of New York in 2003. It has won numerous awards and is currently touring throughout the United States. In 1999, Ms. Chornesky was the recipient of a grunt from the Cultural Affairs Office of Los Angeles for the project Hybrid City, an examination of multiculturalism in Los Angeles. In the mid-nineties through a grant from Stanford University and Art Matters, she moved to a Bosnian Muslim refugee camp in Croatia, producing a body of work documenting the elders who lived there. The National Italian American Foundation, New York City Council Member Helen Sears from District 25, Queens, the Lidia Matticchio Bastianich Foundation and the National Organization of Italian American Women have provided generous funding for this exhibition. The Italian American Museum is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 am - 4:00 pm, and by appointment. The Italian American Museum is in transitional residence at the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute/Queens College, The City University of New York. It is located at 28 West 44th Street, 17th floor, New York, NY 10036.

Interesting Genealogy An ancestor in New Julfa married the daughter of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's cousin. A widely traveled great uncle Malkom wrote a treatise Usul-i Adamiyat (The Principles of Humanity) and founded a League of Humanity in Persia in the 19th century, stipulating that members of all religions be admitted. He founded an influential journal QANUN (LAW), with Union - Justice - Progress as a subtitle. In it he recommended a fixed code of laws and the assembly of a parliament. He was appointed Minister in London in 1872, and instructed by the Shah to participate in the Congress of Berlin as Persian delegate, minister plenipotentiary and ambassador extraordinary. He secured the restoration from the Ottoman Empire of the border area of Qutur and was given the title of Prince Malcom. (See Almanach de Gotha for 1881). In a lecture in London in 1891 entitled Persian Civilisation, he suggested that the principles of civilisation would not be accepted in the Muslim East if they were presented as essentially European, and by association, Christian in origin. The way to secure their acceptance was to divest them of their European aspect. We found that ideas, which were by no means accepted when coming from your agents in Europe, were accepted at once with the greatest delight when it was proved that they were latent in Islam.

"CORNELL University in upstate New York opened its Islam awareness week with a speech by Fidelma O'Leary, 45, an Irish-born professor of neuroscience at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. O'Leary was the key speaker because she converted from Catholicism to Islam. Leitrim native O'Leary filmed her journey into Islam for the National Geographic channel. Her documentary, Inside Makkah, was shown to open the festival. National Geographic filmed four Muslims from around the world as they traveled to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, on a hajj, a religious pilgrimage Muslims make in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar. It is seen by Muslims as an opportunity to strengthen their spiritual relationship between themselves and Allah through a series of holy rituals. Speaking after the screening, O'Leary defies traditional perceptions of a Muslim woman. She is a tall blond with green eyes. She says she fought to find Islam and adds that it is a misunderstood religion. Islam is a development of the faith that I already had. Islam worked for me and I was completely at peace with my religion, she said to a packed auditorium as part of her lecture, An American Woman's Jihad. But it was a long journey and a struggle to surrender my will to the will of God. I was raised in a culture where thinking about religion was taboo. I was a teenager, so naturally I rebelled. I started thinking. O'Leary started to question the religious beliefs and practices she was raised on, and she began to study religion. She said it was then that she became a person of faith, searching for an answer. When she came across the Qur'an, the key text of Islam, she fully related to it. There's beauty in all religions. Islam is a very inclusive path. It never claims exclusive access to God or to paradise, she explained. Everything fell into place when I read it. There is one God, one people, one humanity and one message. While finding Islam was relatively easy, O'Leary's conversion was not. Her parents were devout Catholics, and she said they were not supportive when she decided to convert. They have gotten used to it, she says, but they still do not embrace it. In Islam, this life's struggle is known as jihad, an internal quest of self-improvement and patience. O'Leary, a co-founder of the Freedom of Faith Foundation, an educational organization that seeks to create a tolerant society where all people can practice their faiths, moved to the United States after college and attended graduate school in Houston. She got married and had two children Yousef, 22, and Sara, 20, both of whom now attend the University of Texas and were raised Muslim. O'Leary has worked at St. Edward's University for seven years. She is now divorced. She felt that the best way to strengthen her faith was to make the journey to Mecca. When she decided to go, a friend told her that National Geographic was looking for Muslims making the journey for a documentary. The (journey, called a) hajj is a very private, spiritual endeavor. I felt being filmed might be a big distraction. But Islam is misunderstood and misrepresented, she said. So she decided to go along with the film. The filmmakers obtained special permission to film at Makkah's Sacred Mosque and the holy Ka'abah, central to the site. To get a visa for hajj, O'Leary had to get a certificate from her mosque in Texas to say she was a legitimate Muslim, and her son had to write her a letter giving his permission. I don't know why anyone would want to go spend a week with three million sweaty people in the heat of the desert unless they were really doing this for the love of God, she said in the documentary. I had some women in my group, and some women who were strangers to me, try to tell me what it's like to be a Muslim, and ask me, 'Are you really Muslim?' I think they forgot for a moment that you can only be here if you're Muslim. It gets a little bit tiresome day after day. It can be upsetting. She said filming her journey challenged people's perceptions of Muslims and she felt it would encourage others to think about the religion. There's going to be a lot of green-eyed Irish Muslims coming here and blue-eyed British Muslims coming here, and Muslims from the U.S. There's going to be all sorts of looks, more and more I think. For O'Leary it helped that the producers of the documentary were seeking to demolish the stereo-type of what a Muslim woman is. We have much to learn in this country and around the world, and Islam awareness week is an important part to our community, O'Leary told the audience at the end of her speech.

"On Saturday, January 22, 2005, His Holiness Catholicos Aram I received a delegation of the National Council of Churches USA at the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia here. The representatives of the Middle East Council of Churches and His Grace Bishop Nareg Alemezian (Ecumenical Officer) were also in attendance. The delegation is visiting the Middle East to become acquainted with the situation more closely and to express its solidarity to the peace process. His Holiness shared with his guests the emerging religious, social and political concerns in Lebanon and the Middle East and underlined the importance of overcoming violence and establishing a peaceful society enhanced by long-standing Christian-Muslim coexistence. His Holiness spoke about the challenges facing the ecumenical movement and identified areas where the Churches should cooperate and support each other. His Holiness underlined that ecumenical advocacy and solidarity should be expressed through the tangible actions and continuous support of Churches towards each other. We do not live in isolation. Global, regional and local challenges are inter-connected and we need to adopt a policy of facing them together and responsibly. In this respect, the role of the Churches should be expressed as bridge-builders and promoters of dialogue and collaboration, and the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia is strongly committed to this principle, underlined His Holiness. Referring to the situation in Iraq and Jerusalem, His Holiness reminded all the Churches and especially the USA Churches to encourage their governments to work for peace and justice all over the world and to embark on the establishment of communities living in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust. The Armenians in the Holy Land and Iraq are an integral part of the population of these countries, which is the focus of our prayers and attention. We are sharing all the difficulties in the region and contributing to the peace process with a firm commitment to the Christian-Muslim coexistence and the promotion of the common values that have sustained us for centuries, stated His Holiness. The delegation expressed its gratitude for this opportunity and invited His Holiness to address the National Council of Churches USA Board meeting in October in New York.

"A WHITE horse is about to drown in a surging river. Its owner tries desperately to save it but knows that he doesn't have much time. He calls for help and lights appear over the hedge. He is relieved, until he sees that his rescuer is a British Army truck on patrol. The man is stung with humiliation. His wife and daughter were killed by the British Army in a reckless accident and he hates the military. If he doesn't accept their help his daughter will have to watch the horse drown in the torrent and his son's favorite animal will be lost It a shocking drama that proves so powerful it won an Oscar nomination for the screen version of Colum McCann's novella Everything in This Country Must. The film was directed by Gary McKendry, a Northern Ireland/U.S. emigrant best known for his work on big budget U.S. commercials. He had never dared direct a short film before, until he read McCann's work and begged to be allowed to film it. When McCann meets the Irish Voice for an interview last weekend, he is sitting in the storeroom of Swift's bar in downtown Manhattan, surrounded by whiskey bottles, a cash register and a worktable. We have been offered the room for the interview because of the noise upstairs, and the place has special significance for McCann. It was in this bar that he first met Gary McKendry. I got a call out of the blue three years ago, he recalls. It was Gary. I didn't know who he was. He said, 'Are you by any chance the author of Every thing in This Country Must'? He asked if anyone owned the rights to it and we started talking. McCann had held back from other directors because he feared they might ham up a very nuanced story in which there are no real guilty parties, just accidents, passion and history overwhelming the characters. The two met in Swifts and McKendry made the astonishing claim that, on his directorial debut, he would win an Oscar nomination. It sounds arrogant and boastful but it's not because he's very generous and quiet and determined and he just wanted to make a great film, says McCann. There was something about McKendry's enthusiasm that won over McCann, even though his film work extended to commercials for Budweiser, Nike, some Super Bowl commercials. He had really made a name for himself in the commercial world, recalls McCann. But he wanted to make a short film to show that he could tell a story from beginning to end. McKendry also had to find the courage to return to Northern Ireland, knowing that if he messed the film up, it would destroy him in his homeland. Writing the script was also an enormous challenge for McCann, better known for exhaustively researched novels that explore the darker side of the psyche. In his last novel, The Dancer, he used the painful life of ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, to explore wider themes of social isolation. In This Side of Brightness, he went deep under New York to meet the subway tunnel homeless. The result was an intense, dark novel that united the modern city with its unpleasant past. In Everything in This Country Must, he was determined to show that, while he is now married to an American and raising a family in New York, he is still capable of writing about his home country. As with its accompanying story, Wood, about a Loyalist boy making banners for the marching season, McCann is fascinated by young people who are caught up in historical events but who are aware of little outside the immediacy of their own lives. I'm trying to capture moments of consciousness that are not fully formed among kids. They get sideswiped by ordinary moments, like the horse caught in the river or the kid having to make banners for the marching day. They don't quite know what's going on, he says. For the screenplay, McCann and McKendry worked out some of the visual imagery together. We'd meet up and talk about various images like a raindrop coming off the barbed wire. If I step outside of my involvement, I think he did something really powerful and meaningful and he put it on the line at his own expense. He even had to get two horses and horse trainers and he had to have heated tanks by the river to keep the animals warm. Inspectors from the Northern Ireland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals were there to ensure that the horses were not harmed during the river scene. It was an important point. Gary was frozen. The horses were in a lot better shape than he was, McCann laughs. His work as a reporter, and his childhood days visiting his mother's family in Deny Country, helped him write the screenplay. A former Irish Young Journalist of the Year, McCann was born into a reporting family. His father began as a goalkeeper for Charlton Athletic in England before moving to the BBC to work as a soccer commentator. The media experience helped secure a job in the Evening Press in Ireland. The elder McCann told his son never to become a reporter. Like the dutiful son I was, I completely ignored him and went straight in, McCann recalls. While many reporters migrate from the Irish provincial towns to Dublin, McCann went the other way, reporting on county council meetings in the west for Ireland for the Mayo newspaper, The Connaught Telegraph. He loved the experience and saw it was a relief from rigid middle class Dublin society. While he moved back to Dublin to report he never settled down, eventually ending up in New York with his American wife, Alison, and their three young children. His latest project has taken him to eastern Europe for an upcoming novel about Roma gypsies. He traveled Presov, on the Slovakian border with Ukraine and was shocked by the poverty. It's still pretty astounding. People are living in mud and wattle huts, literally, McCann says. No running water, no electricity, very little food. Generally, they live on the outskirts of the village. The kids out there have bridges over the streams and are playing in the water, no clothes on their backs. He was particularly shocked by the attitude of the liberal intellectual class, who were quick to criticize the treatment of ethnic minorities in the U.S., but could not recognize the discrimination and poverty suffered by the Roma. They are one of the last people you are allowed to dislike. You meet intellectuals over there who say, 'Oh, you live in New York, there's such and such happening with the African American community, and nation against the Muslim community.' You go along with their arguments to a certain point but then you say, 'But what's going on in Slovakia with the Roma?' and they say, 'Oh, but that's okay, they are just gypsies.' As with This Side of Brightness, McCann's research takes him on a journey into the lives of people marginalized by society. I met women who had been sterilized just five years ago. I stayed with a family in a small little town whose house had been burnt down two weeks beforehand by the local mayor. It was astonishing stuff, appalling stuff, he says. As I listen to stories of McCann's research, I wonder what drove him to record some of the most wretched experiences on the planet, when other members of his family were content to live a middle class life in Dublin. I think it's necessary for some people, he says. You write from sort of reckless inner need. I don't really want to write about the world I live in which is fairly rarified, middle class white and safe, because it doesn't really interest me. There are a lot of stories there that went untold for a long, long time. I'm just trying to capture some of what has been left behind. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"OCCUPATION: Waitress at the Playwright Downs bar and restaurant on West 35th Street in New York City. Also designs evening and wedding attire. When did you come to the U.S.? I arrive 10 years ago, and I love it here. It seems like yesterday. I've lived in Woodside in Queens since I arrived. I'm originally from Phibsboro in Dublin. All my family is still back there. I came here after completing a four-year course in fashion design. I had an interview with Calvin Klein and they offered me a job, but the visa would have been very restrictive that came with it. They told me they could revoke it if I didn't work out, or if they didn't like me. They gave me 48 hours to think about the offer. So I went to PJ Kearney's pub and got drunk, and they offered me a job there! I took it and haven't looked back since. Has fashion always been a passion for you? Pretty much. When I first went to college I studied animation. My roommate in the bedsit studied fashion, and I wound up doing most of her homework for her and I really enjoyed it, so much so that I decided to give up animation and study fashion full-time. I still love to design, and I make special order bridal wear and evening wear. I also do things like Sweet 16 dresses. It's something I'll always like to do. What's great about life in the U.S.? Everything! I like the money I make. When I lived at home I used to have to save for two weeks to buy a pair of shoes. I know things have changed since then in Ireland, but I really love my life here and have made loads of friends. I travel to Ireland twice a year so I don't get homesick. My job at the Playwright is a great way to meet people from all over. I love the staff here, too. I really can't complain about anything. What are your future plans? I would love to open my own bar here in three or four years. My father was an electrical engineer and when I was young we used to travel because of his job. When I was 7 we lived in Iraq, believe it or not, and I've also lived in Pakistan, Chile and Brazil. In every place we lived my dad always opened a bar. The one he had in Pakistan was set up in the back of a trailer because it's a Muslim country, but it worked! That's where I got the bar bug from. I'm hopeful it will happen. What do you do with your free time? I love sewing, and I also do a lot of adult gymnastics at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. It's a great way to keep fit and relieve stress.

"A MAN accused of ripping off the families of Irish American firefighters killed on September 11 also raised huge sums of money that he claimed would pay for bibles, electric wheelchairs and CAT scans for Irish children suffering from a crippling disease, the Irish Voice has learned. William Bill Bresnahan, a former Philadelphia cop, is in prison awaiting trial next month on more than 200 charges of ripping off U.S. charities and pocketing money that was supposed to be paid to Irish children suffering from cerebral palsy. Bresnahan is also known for writing a discredited book on his heroics at the World Trade Center on September 11, a day in which he claimed to meet the late Father Mychal Judge just before the firefighter chaplain was killed by falling debris. Bresnahan later toured the U.S., earning fame and appearance fees as a motivational speaker, telling his audiences how he strapped himself to firemen as he searched through the rubble at Ground Zero, and how he converted some Muslim vendors to Christianity after he stopped a vengeful mob from attacking them after the attacks. Bresnahan claimed that the proceeds from his book, 9/11 Attack On America, went to the Emerald Society Hero's Fund to provide for the children of Irish American firemen lost on September 11 and other disasters. After a long, strange journey of denial, admission and denial again, Bresnahan goes on trial next month on more than 200 counts of fraud and violation of Philadelphia's charity rules, in a case that has stunned charities and churches in New York and Pennsylvania. Prosecutors say they have ample bank account records to prove that Bresnahan took hundreds of thousands of dollars from charities and deposited the money in family bank accounts and those of at least three corporations he owned. Investigations by the Irish Voice reveal that there is no such organization as Children's Cerebral Palsy Ireland, the organization he claimed was a beneficiary of his charity, Rise and Shine Ministries Incorporated. A spokeswoman for Enable Ireland, formerly known as Cerebral Palsy Ireland, said she was sure the organization had never heard of Bresnahan and had never received the bibles, electric wheelchairs and CAT scans he had promised. There was never any contact with him and there was never a separate children's organization. It's absolutely astonishing, she told the Irish Voice. Enable Ireland is not the only supposed beneficiary of Bresnahan that never heard of him until contacted by the Irish Voice. Sean McCabe, the president of the Westchester Firefighters Emerald Society, the organization that created the Emerald Heroes Fund to help the families of lost firefighters, said that the organization never heard of Bresnahan and never received money from his book sales. In fact, the whole premise of Bresnahan's book (widely available through Barnes and Noble and Amazon) is now under serious doubt. The detective branch of the Decatur Police Department in Illinois confirmed that its members had lodged an official police complaint after hearing one of Bresnahan's motivational speeches at a Christian business people's meeting. One of the officers made some calculations during Bresnahan's speech. It turned out that Bresnahan would have had to travel at least 130 miles per hour to get from his home in Philadelphia to the World Trade Center site, in time to meet Father Judge, and that's not even counting in the chaos, traffic and confusion of the day. Nobody with Father Judge that day recalled meeting Bresnahan. Bresnahan was charged with fraud by deception in Illinois, as he had profited from what the police said was a complete fabrication. However, according to the police, the charges were dropped in favor of a federal investigation. To make matters worse, the White House officially denied claims in the book that President Bush had awarded Bresnahan a National Leadership Award for his bravery at the World Trade Center rescue site. However, many newspapers (including the Irish Voice) and TV stations had already reported on the former police officer's gutsy tales of heroism at Ground Zero. In an interview with the Cybercast News Service in December, 2001, Bresnahan said he still asks God every day why he's alive, despite the fact that one of the World Trade Center towers collapsed while he was helping rescue victims. I'm searching for the guy who pulled me out, he is quoted as saying. We had people trapped in stairwells for hours at a time before they got them out. I guess I was just fortunate to be around guys who got me out. Bresnahan claimed he was taken to hospital but discharged himself. Why did you go back? the reporter asked admiringly. Bresnahan had a modest answer prepared. I guess you have to be one of us to appreciate what we incurred that day, when we knew that we lost 370 police and fire and so many civilians. We also had bodies and limbs all over the place and we were short of manpower, Bresnahan said. I guess it was something within each of us. It was the drive that we had within us to save our comrades, he added. As the story began to unravel, a journalist who helped write the book, David M. Bresnahan (no relation to William) totally distanced himself from Bill Bresnahan. Although his work email no longer appears active, David Bresnahan wrote on a website that he is cooperating with police and that he was duped by William. He went on to say that he spotted the serious inaccuracy about Father Judge after the manuscript was finished but could not get William to make an alteration before printing. He adds that Bresnahan did not give the money from the sales of the book to the Emerald Society Hero Fund However heinous the allegations of taking money from the children of fallen firefighters, and of profiting from the death of those same firefighters, further allegations would arise that could lead to even more serious criminal charges. Since at least 1999, Bresnahan had been running his charity, Rise and Shine Incorporated. It worked mostly by taking large amounts of stock such as clothes and toys from churches and religious charities, on the promise that it would be distributed to the poor. Bresnahan set up a website, since removed, in which he claimed that monies donated would go to Children's Cerebral Palsy Ireland and a leprosy hospital in Hawaii. One of those greatly impressed by his work was Reverend Gary Belis, pastor of Newport Assembly of God Church in Pennsylvania. He basically received products from us to be donated to needy people in various locations in the U.S, he told the Irish Voice. Unfortunately, he was selling many of the loads and placing the profits in his for-profit businesses. This man damaged a lot of people, which is extremely sad, he said. Bresnahan's story began to lose credibility when he sold donated products onto a broker, who sold them on to discount stores, not knowing they had been given to Bresnahan by charities. The stores began to complain, as some of the goods were clearly marked Not for resale. Bresnahan assured the broker that the charities had agreed to the resale. However, with such visible evidence now openly available in discount stores, the Pennsylvania Charities Bureau was soon on the case. In 2003, the truth finally caught up with Bresnahan when he was fined more than $90,000 for fraudulent use of his charity status. A bureau spokesperson said that Bresnahan had submitted a large amount of documents outlining the aims of his charity, which were easily shown to be misleading. Bresnahan took down his website. However, a religious-based charity donor had kept printed copies of the pages. That person showed it to the Irish Voice on condition of anonymity. It showed Bresnahan's claim that the profits from Rise and Shine had been intended for Irish children suffering from cerebral palsy. After the charity bureau investigation, it was almost inevitable that criminal proceedings would follow. Laurie Rudy was among a group of donors who met with Bresnahan last year. According to her and other church based charity workers, Bresnahan admitted his wrongdoing and started to cry. At a later court hearing at a criminal court south of Philadelphia, he tried to get an adjournment, claiming he was sick. However, after the judge refused, he apologized, claiming he had not met the case well and agreed to proceed. However, Bresnahan walked away from a plea agreement, much to Belis's astonishment. Whatever the outcome of next month's trial, Bresnahan has already been found by a civil court to be guilty of hiding cash that should have gone to the disadvantaged. For those hurt by Bresnahan, the task of unraveling this huge maze of deceit has only just begun. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"An expert in the conservation of paper, a freelance expert on Islam, and a range of other characters are caught up in the search for a rare book that promises to reveal secrets about the Christian and Muslim worlds. The similarity with Don Brown's Da Vinci Code is inescapable, but it is a similarity only in the broad outline of the plot. Where Brown's characters are largely two-dimensional, those created by Derham have an extraordinary depth that is only revealed in the final chapters; where Brown sets out an easily grasped notion of suppression by the Church, Derham makes the reader work to extract the meaning and importance of The Book, a volume that leads to multiple deaths and an astonishing degree of violence. Windsong is topical in the extreme, dealing as it does with the increasing dichotomy between the post 9/11 Muslim East and Christian West, involving military superiority, suicide bombers, and human frailty. Moving between Dublin's Chester Beatty Library and Istanbul, Rio Dawson and Jerome Flanagan follow the trail of the Book of the Warnings of the Messenger Spirit sometimes together, sometimes as adversaries, shadowed by friends and enemies but never sure which. The characters are variously tortured in a Turkish military jail, held captive and killed by a man desperate to retain both his secret life and his standing in the community, blown apart by a bomb, or killed by a rejected lover, the litany of carnage escalating in the last chapters. But to highlight the action scenes in the novel would do it a disservice, for much of the narrative is taken up with the examination of the nature of being, of pleasure and of passion. The author makes much use of quotations to establish the tenor of each chapter, including the writings of Islam, Stendahl, Horace, and St John Gogarty, and it is this combination of metaphysical musing and international intrigue that places Windsong apart from the general run of modern thrillers. The device of using an electronic diary to progress the plot sometimes leads to a confusion of continuity, and there are one or two irritating mistakes, but Roger Derham's latest novel provides an absorbing, if somewhat challenging, reading experience.

"Hampartzoum Chitjian was 103 years old when he passed away in Los Angeles last year. During the final 30 years of his life, he worked on his memoirs - carefully recording memories of his native village of Perri (near Kharpert), recounting his traumatic experiences as a child victim of the Armenian Genocide, and his subsequent escape and settlement in Mexico City and Los Angeles. On November 15, 2004, old friends, relatives and historians paid tribute to Hampartzoum Chitjian at the launch of his English- and Armenian-language memoirs, A Hair's Breadth from Death and Mazi Chap Mahi Mod. The event took place in front of a packed audience at the United Armenian Congregational Church in Los Angeles. The evening was sponsored by the Armenian Film Foundation (Thousand Oaks, CA) and Garod Books Ltd. (London). According to historian and publisher Ara Sarafian, Hampartzoum's work is probably the last great memoir of the Armenian Genocide. This is because the author's memory of events is vivid and the Genocide forms a substantial part of his book. Furthermore, Hampartzoum's peculiar experience gives voice to tens of thousands of Armenian children who were also left in their native villages to be assimilated into Muslim households in what is now Turkey - after their parents were killed by their captors. In the case of Hampartzoum, he escaped to survive as a fugitive in different villages in the Kharpert region. He was forced to deny his Armenian identity until he could escape to the outside world in 1921. Very few Armenian child victims survived and wrote such memoirs: most of them were either killed or remained in Turkey where they became Turks and Kurds. However, a large number were collected from Muslim households, wherever possible, at the end of World War I - and this process (the vorpahavak) was also witnessed by Hampartzoum Chitjian in the Kharpert region. On a more personal note, Sarafian, who recently visited Perri on a study trip, also commented how well Hampartzoum remembered his native village, and how much of that village still remains today. All of the sketch maps and diagrams in Hampartzoum's memoirs are still useful today. Sarafian added that the Gomidas Institute (UK) is already organizing further study trips to Perri and other (former) Armenian villages in Turkey today. Hilmar Kaiser, a noted expert on the Armenian Genocide, was also an invited guest. He also stressed the importance of Hampartzoum's work and gave some personal insights into the man. He described how he had visited the Chitjian home over the years and how Hampartzoum always wanted to record every detail in his memoir, including the rendition or special words in his own dialect of Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish. Despite his failing health, Hampartzoum remained sharp and focused until his death. Kaiser stressed the importance of publishing such memoirs for our understanding of the Armenian Genocide. (Kaiser's latest work on the Armenian Genocide is the previously unpublished autobiography of Abram I. Elkus, The Memoirs of Abram Elkus: Lawyer, Ambassador, Statesman (Gomidas Institute, London, 2004). J. Michael Hagopian (Armenian Film Foundation) followed Kaiser and also gave a moving account of Hampartzoum Chitjian. After all, the latter had been his babysitter in Kharpert at the end of WWI. They also became close friends later on in Los Angeles. J. Michael presented some video footage of Hampartzoum recounting his experiences in Ottoman Turkey as a survivor of the Genocide. Hampartzoum honored J. Michael's father in his memoir as a great physician and brave humanitarian, who saved many Armenian lives in Kharpert during the 1915 Genocide. J. Michael today is the director of many films on the Armenian Genocide, including Voices from the Lake and Germany and the Secret Genocide. The center stage of the evening belonged to Seda Maronyan, who worked diligently with Hampartzoum for many years and wrote down much of his memoirs, and Sara Chitjian, Hampartzoum's loving daughter. Sara encouraged her father to record his own story for posterity and worked to carefully edit both the Armenian and English versions of the book. She described how her father was reluctant to write his memoirs until the 1970s when Armenian and non-Armenian schoolchildren and their parents showed interest in what he had to say. That was when her father realized that his past and his quest for justice for the Armenian people was not a lost cause. Another impetus for the memoir was the discovery of stacks of letters Hampartzoum had written to his brothers in the United States, even before the Genocide. These letters prompted Hampartzoum's memory and structured his book. Sara is currently working on the publication of these letters. A Hair's Breadth from Death: The Memoirs of Hampartzoum Chitjian allows readers to take an incredible journey into Armenian life of Perri before 1915, and the life of an Armenian child-survivor who was cast into the winds of the Genocide in 1915. Through this work we can begin to understand the horrors of 1915 and the suffering of an entire generation of Armenians. Hampartzoum (the Armenian word for resurrection) is a befitting name for a man who was both victim and witness to the Armenian Genocide.

"In the ongoing furor over Turkey's efforts to join the European Union (EU), who has made the biggest fool of themselves? The EU, which is too spineless and politically correct to tell Turkey that it's unfit to ever become a member? Or Turkey, to whom European means spraying itself down with deodorant, putting on a suit and tie, and legislating a few nice-sounding but unimplemented reforms? Actually, the biggest fools may be those who believe that the Christian EU will reform Turkey and restrain it from ever again abusing its Armenians or attacking Armenia. European reform of Turkey, particularly regarding Armenians, is an old idea that has never worked. REFORM'S WRECKAGE Serious reforms were first attempted during Ottoman Turkey's Tanzimat (reorganization) period of 1839 to 1876. Pushed by Europe, Turkey declared measures, quickly proven ineffective, to safeguard the rights of its subjects, including Armenians. A Turkish constitution was then declared in 1876 but suspended, along with parliament, just 2 years later. Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin, signed in 1878 by the European powers, Turkey, and Russia, guaranteed the safety of Ottoman Armenians but was dead before the ink dried. Turkish reforms reached new levels in the 1890s with massacres of hundreds of thousands of Armenians. In 1908 came the reformist Young Turk party. Inspired by European ideals, it pledged liberty, equality, and fraternity. Reform culminated in the cataclysm of 1915. Turkey's next European-inspired reformer was Kemal Ataturk, who all but finished off the country's remaining Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian Christians, not to mention thousands of Muslim Kurds. He seized historical western Armenia, which Europe had promised to Armenians, and attacked the just-reborn Armenian Republic while Europe looked on. Ataturk's reformist legacy endures to this day: Genocide denial, the blockade of Armenia, and 80 years of military coups, human-rights abuses galore, and even massacres, all tolerated by Europe. TURKEY'S SIGNIFICANCE Today comes yet another collection of Turks pledging European-approved reform. This too will end in disaster if history is any guide. Given Europe's wretched record regarding Armenians, there is little evidence that the EU will ever restrain Turkey against Armenia. Europe, as well as America, simply see Turkey as more useful than Armenia. Turkey is terribly important, President Clinton once declared, and should be anchor[ed] to the West because of the size of the country ... its geostrategic significance, where it is, what it can block, and where it can open doors to. Indeed, for centuries, Europe has been propping up Turkey in order to block Russia from the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The West now also deems Turkey an important land bridge - strung with pipelines - into the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea region. Moreover, Turkey's resurrected pan-Turkic dream - with tiny Armenia in the way - of penetrating Azerbaijan and Central Asia dovetails with the West's current objectives. USELESS EUROPE Europe's longtime support for Turkey vis-à-vis Armenians has, unfortunately, not waned. For over 10 years, for example, the EU has done nothing substantive about Turkey's blockade of Armenia. No reason exists, therefore, to believe the EU (or the US) will ever truly press Turkey on that issue. In 1923, Europe and Turkey signed the Treaty of Lausanne, which guaranteed the rights of Turkey's few remaining Christians, particularly Armenians. Yet Turkey's own Human Rights Advisory Committee recently acknowledged that Turkey has not honored its Lausanne obligations. Obviously then, Europe, as a treaty signatory, has ignored its obligations too. The conclusion? Future guarantees by the EU to Armenia and to Turkey's minorities are probably worthless. True, the European Parliament and a few European nations have acknowledged the Genocide, but only after being dragged kicking and screaming, for years and, even then, only halfheartedly. But didn't the EU force Turkey to stop its war against Kurds and grant them rights? No. The Kurdish conflict has wound down only because Turkey conducted a ruthless campaign of murder, destruction, and deportation. Moreover, Kurdish rights are still mostly words on paper. Indeed, Turkey has been legislating various EU reforms without actually implementing them. Even the US State Department acknowledged this year that many of the reforms were not implemented ... and some reforms adopted in 2002 still were not implemented. That's no surprise, given nearly 200 years of Turkey's ignoring or reversing reforms while Europe just wagged its finger. TURKISH POWER Will Turkish membership in the EU somehow deter Turkey from military action against Armenia? We know that the EU did not come to the aid Armenians during the Karabagh war when Turkey gave Azerbaijan military support and threatened Armenia. Indeed, a future Turkish thrust into Armenia might not be inconsistent with the West's own objectives. The fact is that Turkey successfully defies Europe - Cyprus is one example - unless Europe credibly threatens military action, which it essentially never does. Moreover, notes former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, Turkey, with its fast-growing population of 73 million people, would be the largest state in the EU and a key factor in the [EU's] decision-making process. That is, the tail (Turkey) would probably wag the dog (the EU). And, frankly, Turks have shown again and again that they are tougher and more stubborn than Europeans, particularly wobbly-kneed Western Europeans. THE DOWNSIDE If Turkey joins the EU, its economy would be enormously strengthened by European subsidies and guidance, just as was Ireland's. Thus, even if reforms were to succeed and the EU minimally constrained Turkish belligerence, Turkey would end up much stronger economically, politically, and hence militarily, thereby canceling out any benefit for Armenia. One shouldn't want an adversary to acquire more allies and become more militarily powerful. That is axiomatic. Some Armenians hallucinate, however, that a prosperous, confident Turkey will necessarily be less aggressive. In an analogous case, ask yourself: do you want Azerbaijan to be economically and militarily more powerful? Of course you don't. Moreover, Turkish workers will go to EU countries under the latter's generous internal migration laws and create huge diasporan lobbies that will threaten Europe's Armenian communities. Even now, Germany is home to more than two million Turks, with perhaps one or two million elsewhere in Europe. WHY TURKEY? Most Europeans want to keep Turkey out of EU. Turkey, they say, is neither culturally nor historically European, is too poor, and would flood Europe with millions of migrant workers. Unfortunately, many politically correct Europeans do not want to reject Turkey because they fear appearing intolerant. Clearly, some European businesses want cheap young Turkish labor since Europe itself is aging and has a low birthrate. Turkey will also serve as a large market for European goods and services. Giscard d'Estaing wisely observes that Turkey would strike at the foundation of the still fragile EU and did not share any part of Europe's heritage, including rational and scientific thought. That the EU would ignore such wisdom and its own citizens' misgivings suggests that it would probably disregard Armenia's opinions in the future. The EU, unfortunately, hungers for growth and power, seeking, in President Clinton's words, to anchor Turkey to the West for geostrategic reasons. STRATEGIES The current Armenian strategy is simply to ask that the EU require Turkey to fulfill a few Armenian-specific requirements, such as opening the border. That approach, however, ought to be a last resort. It sells Armenia too cheaply and gives Turkey undeserved credit for being otherwise qualified. Instead, Armenia and the Diaspora should join hands with those principled Europeans who unequivocally oppose Turkish membership because Turkey is unqualified in general, and unfit for Armenian reasons.

"The 10-person delegation from Australia arrived this morning after participating in a Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Dialogue involved religious leaders from the major faiths and religions and Interfaith experts from the South East Asia region that included Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Timor Leste and Viet Nam. The theme of the Dialogue was Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation: Community Building and Harmony. At the invitation of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, the Hon. Alexander Downer M.P., His Eminence Archbishop Aghan Baliozian, Primate of the Diocese of the Armenian Apostolic Church of Australia and New Zealand, was among the delegation from Australia that included six Christian leaders representing the Catholic, Anglican, Uniting, Lutheran and Armenian Orthodox Churches, plus representatives from the Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist and Hindu faiths. The Dialogue on Interfaith Cooperation is a joint Australia-Indonesia initiative announced by Mr. Downer and his Indonesian counterpart, H.E. Dr. N. Hassan Wirajuda at the ASEAN meetings in Jakarta in July. The broad objective of the Dialogue is to convene discussion among world denominations and to foster greater understanding and cooperation between the various faith communities in the region. By working together more closely, there is also much potential to resolve the challenges that face communities today. On his return, Archbishop Aghan said, It was a high-level delegation that demonstrated a mutual respect and understanding toward differing faiths and beliefs. It is with real hope that the dialogue will continue to create real harmony in the region. The organizing of the Dialogue is a reflection of the good relationship between the Republic of Indonesia and Australia. It provides a strong basis for reinforcing mutually beneficial ties between the two countries and, in this case, a good understanding of interfaith issues.

"The AGBU of Toronto and the Zoryan Institute jointly hosted an evening of two lectures on Nagorno Karabagh on October 29, 2004 at the AGBU Alex Manoogian Cultural Centre, covering its history of independence and its current status in light of international law and politics, as it was time for a new, up-to-date assessment. The issue of Karabagh's independence, which caused a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan, became a critical subject in international politics during the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The essence of the conflict was the priority of the self-determination of the people of Karabagh, an autonomous republic, versus the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan as a nation-state incorporating the Nagorno Karabagh Republic (NKR). Since the 1994 cease-fire between Armenia and Azerbaijan, the conflict has dropped from the headlines, and much of what has been written on the subject in the West, particularly in English, has generally been pro-Azeri and anti-Armenian. The exceptions have been the publications of the Zoryan Institute, such as The Karabagh File, The Sumgait Tragedy, and The Making of Nagorno-Karabagh: From Secession to Republic, as well as those by a few others. Prof. George Bournoutian, Senior Professor of History at Iona College, spoke on The Armeno-Azeri Academic Conflict over Karabagh. His lecture was particularly timely as it coincide with the appearance of his new book, Two Chronicles on the History of Karabagh, which has just been released by Mazda Publishers. The book documents, through two Muslim, Persian-language chronicles of the 18th and early 19th centuries, respectively, the existence of Karabagh as an unquestioned Armenian territory. It clearly refutes modern Azerbaijani historians, who falsify primary source materials in order to deny the existence of the Armenians in their ancestral homelands. Mr. Vardan Barseghyan, Permanent Representative of the Nagorno-Karabagh Republic in the United States, spoke on The Current Situation Regarding the Independence of Nagorno Karabagh and International Law. He noted that the population of Nagorno Karabagh never saw itself as part of Azerbaijan, and Stalin's forced separation of Karabagh from Armenia in 1923 remained a source of continued protest and international conflict. Mr. Barseghyan described how, in August 1991, Azerbaijan announced it was seceding from the Soviet Union. Two days later, in compliance with then existing Soviet law, which gave the right of self-determination to republics seceding from the Soviet Union, the NKR declared its independence from the newly established Azerbaijan Republic. This was followed in December 1991 with a referendum, in which an overwhelming majority of Karabagh's population voted for independence. A principle was being challenged: if the Republic of Azerbaijan had the right to secede from the Soviet Union, then the Autonomous Republic of Nagorno Karabagh had the right to secede from Azerbaijan. Mr. Barseghyan explained how the NKR meets international criteria for sovereignty: 1. Effective control over a defined territory. 2. A permanent population. 3. Regular armed forces, which are under civilian control. 4. A democratically elected government with executive, legislative and judicial branches. 5. Effective conduct of its foreign affairs. The NKR seeks three main points in its negotiations with Azerbaijan: 1. The existence of Karabagh. 2. Peer-to-peer relations between Azerbaijan and Karabagh. 3. International guarantees for the NKR. The most important prerequisite for negotiations, stated Barseghyan, is security and stability in the region, which cannot be achieved without stability in each state. The NKR seeks a political end to the war. Democratic Karabagh cannot be subordinated to Azerbaijan, which violates the rights of its own citizens. He explained his government's position, that in order to resolve the conflict, the reasons for the conflict have to be addressed, before the consequences can be eliminated. Karabagh's status is at the heart of the conflict. The consequences include the displacement of people on both sides, creation of a security belt around Karabagh, and the detrimental impact of the war on the parties' respective economies. Barseghyan stressed that had Azerbaijan succeeded in its attempt to crush Karabagh's assertion of its freedom, Karabagh would have been the victim of another genocide. If Karabagh were to concede any of Azerbaijan's demands unilaterally, he stated, without any concessions in return, we are convinced that, since the Azeris have improved their military position at virtually no cost, they are emboldened to consider renewing military action. Barseghyan pointed out that the Azerbaijani government implemented policies designed to effect the ethnic cleansing of the Armenians from Karabagh. These policies included economic and cultural discrimination, and the encouragement of Azeri settlement in Karabagh. After the outbreak of violence, they also included government-sponsored falsification of the region's history. This view was supported by the main theme of Prof. Bournoutian's lecture. Bournoutian described several examples of how, since 1988, Azerbaijani historians have falsified primary sources by removing all mention of Armenia and the Armenians from them, in an attempt to deny Armenians' ancestral claims to this territory. Historians have a duty to facts, Bournoutian emphasized. Such desperate acts not only reduce Azeri historical claims to Karabagh, but strengthen the Armenian case, he remarked. The reason it seems that most of the publications in the West are very pro-Azeri, he observed, is that Azerbaijan, as well as its staunch supporter Turkey, give lots of grants to Western writers. Armenians are not producing enough books and articles giving a more balanced point of view. There are very few academics who deal with modern Armenian history; universities discourage them, feeling it is too political. In this regard, I must say that there are very few organizations or individuals who address this critical problem, but I must acknowledge the efforts of the AGBU, the Zoryan Institute, the National Association of Armenian Studies and Research, and Mr. Kourken Sarkissian. The political impasse and neglect of the Karabagh issue is somewhat surprising, commented K.M. (Greg) Sarkissian, President of the Zoryan Institute. The recent secessionist movements in East Timor in Southeast Asia, and Eritrea in Africa, for example, are vivid examples of how the Karabagh conflict could be resolved by the international community. In both cases, history shows us that two distinct cultures cannot be forced into a successful union. Therefore, he continued, it is essential to understand this conflict not just from an Armenian perspective, but to know the larger history surrounding it, as well as the international legal and political realities. We hope that through such analytical and informative lectures, we are able to provide people with an understanding of the situation in Karabagh from a universal perspective.

"Washington, D.C.: CEH leaders released the document below that they are using in their behind-the-scenes efforts with key U.S. policy-makers to stop the elimination of the Ecumenical Patriarchate through the leverage provided by Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU). On December 17, 2004 the EU will present Turkey with a document that specifies those practices, regarding religious and human rights, Turkey must change if they are to begin the process of acceding to the EU. CEH is working to secure key U.S. policy-makers to encourage the EU to include in this document language calling on Turkey to allow the Ecumenical Patriarchate appropriate recognition, ecclesiastic succession, training of clergy, property rights and other human rights. ACTION NEEDED TO PRESERVE THE ECUMENICAL PATRIARCHATE Nearly 2,000-year-old center for 250,000 Orthodox Christians facing elimination Recent developments have put into jeopardy the seat of the spiritual leader of millions of Americans and 250 million Orthodox Christians around the world -- the Ecumenical Patriarchate in Istanbul, Turkey. Essentially, the Ecumenical Patriarchate is to Orthodox Christians what the Vatican is to Catholics. Some well-known Orthodox Christians include: San Diego Chargers owner Alex Spanos; former CIA Director George Tenet; U.S. Senators Paul Sarbanes and Olympia Snowe; USAID Director Andrew Natsios; and US Ambassador to Iraq John Negroponte. The EU holds the key to safeguarding the Ecumenical Patriarchate. On December 17, 2004 the EU will present Turkey with a document that specifies those practices, regarding religious and human rights, Turkey must change if they are to begin the process of acceding to the EU. The US State Department is encouraging the EU to include in this document language calling on Turkey to allow the Ecumenical Patriarchate appropriate recognition, ecclesiastic succession, training of clergy, property rights and other human rights. Without such action this living pillar of history for all Christians is jeopardized. The Apostle Andrew (the brother of Peter) established the Ecumenical Patriarchate in what is today Turkey in 37 AD and the current Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew, is the 269th direct successor of the Apostle Andrew. American security interests would also be jeopardized by the loss of this Patriarchal See (location of a religious institution). The Russian Patriarch, who was appointed by the Russian government and holds the largest Orthodox See, would lay claim to the leadership and could influence this worldwide network -- the second largest church in the largest religion in the world. The current Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew, on the other hand, shares pro-western values and consistently strengthens US security interests. For example, he led an EU gathering of religious leaders that produced the first Muslim condemnation of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack as anti-religious. He serves as a natural bridge between civilizations, which is evidenced in his meetings with the top leaders in Muslim countries like Libya and Iran, as well as with US Presidents. Like George Washington, Winston Churchill and Mother Teresa, he received the Congressional Gold Medal for his efforts to promote peace and religious tolerance and his extraordinary leadership on behalf of the environment. Some recent actions by Turkey against the religious rights of the Ecumenical Patriarchate follow. If they continue the Ecumenical Patriarchate will be eliminated. * In just the last two years, the Turkish government has confiscated 75% of the 1,747 Ecumenical Patriarchal properties. Turkey suddenly put a 42% tax retroactive to 1999 on the Ecumenical Patriarchate's Balukli Hospital. * In recent days, the government of Turkey reversed its commitment to President George Bush. By doing so they have kept the Ecumenical Patriarch in Turkey's catch 22 -- requiring that the Ecumenical Patriarch must be a Turkish citizen while keeping Turkish citizens from qualifying. This assures the extinction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Reversing their commitment to reopen the theological school at Halki guarantees that none of the 2,000 Turkish citizens who are Orthodox (reduced from hundreds-of-thousands by official discrimination) can become Ecumenical Patriarch. * Further, the Prime Minister of Turkey recently reversed his commitment to recognize the Ecumenical Patriarch as the head of the world's Orthodox Christians, instead of just local Orthodox. As well, he insists on maintaining the authority to veto the Orthodox Holy Synod's selection of Ecumenical Patriarchs. The leaders releasing this document include Andrew A. Athens, Chairman, National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes (CEH); National Chairman, United Hellenic American Congress (UHAC); World President, World Council of Hellenes Abroad (SAE); Philip Christopher, Vice Chair, National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes (CEH); President, International Coordinating Committee - Justice for Cyprus (PSEKA); President, Pancyprian Association of America; Andrew E. Manatos, President, National Coordinated Effort of Hellenes (CEH); Executive Board Member, UHAC and PSEKA; Panicos Papanicolaou, Supreme President, Cyprus Federation of America; Nikos Mouyiaris, Executive Vice President, Pancyprian Association of America; Charles Marangoudakis, President, UHAC New York; Executive Board Member, PSEKA.

"The October 10 spitting incident and brawl between a religious Jew and an Armenian Christian Archbishop, in the same streets where Jesus walked and preached, have drawn worldwide attention and have been covered in great and small newspapers and in the internet. Even Pope John Paul II has voiced his indignation. The Cilician Catholicosate of Antelias, in Lebanon, issued a statement to the effect that Armenians in Jerusalem, now numbering only some 3,000, are being systematically harassed and intimidated by the Jews in order to force them to leave Jerusalem, their birthplace. Hence, many are wondering presently if the security of the Jerusalem's Armenians and other Christians is in jeopardy. When the British bestowed former Palestine to the Zionists early in 20th century, the agreement between the British and Zionists stipulated that Zionists would respect and safeguard other established religions in the Promised Land: the Christian denominations (Armenian, Catholic, Greek, Syrian, Ethiopian and Coptic) along with the Muslim ones. Zionist Jews, who would become masters of the Promised Land, were to keep Christian churches and their personnel, the Muslim mosques and their personnel, safe and secure. It is because of the said agreement that Zionists are unable to demolish the Al Asque Mosque, which stand upon the ruins of the Biblical Holy Temple of God, and rebuild upon the same site the Biblical Jewish Temple once again, the third in the series. Neither can the Zionists demolish or take over the Christian churches of Jerusalem and their related properties. If they do, the Zionists run the risk of losing the Promised Land altogether. The stakes are high for the Zionists, and this was another reason behind the Jewish official and religious outrage at the premeditated degrading act of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish student against the Brotherhood of the Armenian Patriarchate of St. James. In conclusion, let me say that the Jerusalem Armenians and their properties, especially the religious ones, are secure. In case of harassment and encroachment upon them by the Jews, the Armenians have to remind the Zionists of the agreement they made with the British, who gave them the Land of Promise in the first place with strings attached and with specific conditions, one of the main ones being that the Zionists would leave other religions and institutions in Jerusalem alone and untouched. Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the USA, said after signing the Constitution: We gave the American people a Republic if they are able to keep it. [Paraphrased.] In the same way, it is as if the British are telling the Christians of Jerusalem: We gave you protection but you have to ask for it when your security it at risk.

"Last week, four decades after Turkey came knocking on Europe's doors, the European Union made a crucial overture toward letting it in. This was, of course, a major victory for this poor, large and overwhelmingly Muslim country, with a population of 70 million, striving to enter the Union after so many years. The decision requires the unanimous approval of the heads of states of 25 countries, which will meet next December to approve the ruling. No head of states is expected to challenge Turkey's candidacy. This does not mean that Turkey will automatically and summarily be accepted into the European Union. Talks are expected to last up to 15 years before Turkey is finally accepted into the Union. Supporters of the Turkish bid to become a member of the European community claim that the mere hope of eventual membership in the European Union would ensure Turkey immense economic benefits. The prospects of such benefits ahead have driven Turkey to major political reforms in the two years since the present administration came to power. Those opposed to the admission of Turkey in the European Union claim that such a momentous decision can only be realized through a popular referendum. Such a movie is seen as dooming Turkey's application. There are circles opposed to Turkey's membership who fear that it will bring waves of unskilled, uneducated, and unemployed Turks westward and may bankrupt Europe. Turkey has made significant inroads in its quest to join the Union. In recent years, that country has made progress in reforming its institutions and has curbed undemocratic practice. It has removed requirements that serve to arbitrarily punish journalists, writers and publishers, and restrict freedom of expression for non-Muslim religious communities, including the significant Armenian presence in the country. On the whole, Turkey's attempt to enter the European Union should be saluted by Armenians everywhere in this country, as it will pave the way for more liberal approaches toward its religious minorities. There are positive signs emerging, such as the publication of literary works by Armenians, the greater freedoms religious minorities enjoy in the country and increased liberalism benefiting Turkish Armenians. These are sign of a trend toward greater tolerance towards minorities after so many years of intolerance. We do not suggest that liberalism must become complete in Turkey, in order for its leaders to take develop a greater understanding of its minorities, as they prepare the country to enter the European Union. The Turkish leaders should and must admit the role played be their ancestors in the commission of the heinous act of trying to annihilate the Armenian minority living in the Ottoman Empire during World War I. Unless this act is recognized, Turkey should be left out of membership of the European Union. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2004-10-16,1
"The agreements on dispatching an Armenian military contingent (50 soldiers) to Iraq under the Polish banner, reached between Robert Kocharian and Alexander Kvasnevski in Warsaw, was quite a great surprise for the Armenian elite/counter-elite. Indeed, in response to the proposal of the allies on the Anti-Iraqi Coalition to send a military contingent to Iraq, the Armenian side used to give uncertain answers, referring to the presence of a large Armenian Diaspora (according to some high-colored data of the Armenian Apostolic Church, close to 500,000 people) in the Islamic countries of the Middle East. Not without reasons did the Armenian diplomatic circles think that the Armenian communities of the whole region could become a potential target for radical Islamic groups once an Armenian military contingent was sent to Iraq. For this reason, official Yerevan used to give to its overseas partners indefinite promises to consider the issue of sending a small auxiliary contingent (truck drivers, field engineers, and doctors) and the quantitative staff of this contingent was changed all the time. It is quite interesting that the American side treated this position of Armenia with understanding and avoided exerting strong political pressure upon Armenia. A natural question arises: what could become a catalyst for such a quick decision, though it is more than obvious to us that until recently official Yerevan was consciously postponing the solution of this issue? EAGER FOR PENTAGON RECEPTION Here we'd like to draw the attention of our readers to the following fact: RA Minister of Defense Serge Sargsian has been eager to be received by the Pentagon: i.e., to pay an official visit to the United States since last May. About half a year has passed since this wish of his was fixed. Hence, one may suppose the higher US military circles have a different view about meeting with Sargsian. The RA minister needs this meeting, first of all, to settle a number of personal problems connected with his own political future. Sargsian is trying to make the Pentagon understand that he is now ready to take more decisive steps towards the United States and NATO. Sargsian started speaking of his willingness to make such steps a long time ago, but today Washington wants concrete steps rather than words. The dispatch of a small Armenian auxiliary military contingent to Iraq is quite acceptable as a first concrete political step. As regards President Kocharian, he also found himself between hammer and anvil; i.e., between Moscow and Washington. Moreover, both the Russians and Americans demand that he should finally determine his position. In this connection, the thesis that the political future of Robert Kocharian will be determined in the United States is getting more and more obvious. In order to alleviate the American pressure against himself, Kocharian decided to dispatch Armenian servicemen to Iraq. So, the decision to send an Armenian military contingent to Iraq was made by the two de facto top figures of Armenia, as this step serves their personal political interests. According to some information, this decision was made by Kocharian and Sargsian with no prior consultation with experts, advisors or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Besides, judging from the reaction of the Russian press, the leaders of Armenia held no serious consultation on this issue with Russia, its strategic ally and major economic partner. In principle, it turns out that, by making the decision to send a military contingent to Iraq, Yerevan ignored last year's joint decision of the CIS CSTO, which, in fact, condemned the actions of the Anti-Iraqi Coalition countries. So, in the eyes of the Kremlin, the current leaders of Armenia are going to take concrete political steps in order to avoid the sphere of Russia's influence. ARMENIAN CONTINGENT OF NO VITAL IMPORTANCE It is more than obvious to us that, in military terms, the dispatch of the Armenian auxiliary contingent to Iraq is of no vital importance. Some Armenian observers and politicians pay attention to the fact that the place where the Armenian auxiliary contingent will be stationed (the sector under Poland's responsibility) isn't a zone of embittered armed clashes; i.e., the possibility of serious casualties is quite low for the Armenian auxiliary contingent. Anyway, in our opinion, the representatives of quite a large local Armenian community, rather than the Armenian community, rather than the Armenian contingent itself, may become the main target of the Iraqi armed resistance guided by radical Islamist slogans. Most Armenians live in Baghdad and Basra. There are some other villages on the Iraqi-Turkish border, where so-called Kurdish-speaking Armenians live today. The exact number of the Armenian community members is unknown, but it should be approximately 20,000 (according to the Armenian Apostolic Church). According to local statistics, the Armenian community of Iraq was quite well to do and has quite a high intellectual level. Many of its representatives graduated from the higher educational institutions in Iraq (most of them received diplomas as doctors and engineers), in the USSR (including in Armenia) and a number of other countries. During the one-and-a-half-year war in Iraq, there has been no information about any special targeted actions of requital against the Armenians by the variegated Iraqi resistance, though there have been actions against Christians (explosion of churches). The appearance of an Armenian auxiliary contingent in Iraq will increase the possibility of such actions sharply, regardless of the fact that the contingent will go there under the flag of Poland. But the potential threat to the Armenian community in Iraq on the part of different radical military groups is only part of the danger for all the Armenian people living in the Middle East. LOCAL ARMENIANS A POTENTIAL TARGET We would remind the reader that the Armenian communities compactly living in the Middle East are also situated in Iran, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. So, the Armenians, as a Christian people, may immediately become a fine target for different types of numerous radical Islamic groups of the entire Middle East, and the appearance of the Armenian military contingent under the Polish flag in Iraq may become a reason for attacks. Indeed, the radical Islamic groups will hardly be interested in determining what function the Armenian servicemen will perform in Iraq. In their eyes they will be people supporting those who struggle against Muslims, and nothing else. There will be no need to go to Europe or cross the Atlantic in order to punish the new enemy bearing a cross on his breast. The Armenians are near, they live in the neighboring yard or neighboring district. It is enough for several mules to suggest this seditious idea to radicals at one of the Friday prayers in any country of the region. A natural question arises: what about the governments of the countries of the Middle East where the Armenians live? Shouldn't they defend their citizens? We suppose that such states as Iran, Lebanon and others will undertake serious measures to ensure the security of their Armenian citizens. But the events may turn into such an uncontrollable mess that the protective measures undertaken by the authorities will prove ineffective at some stage. Casualties are possible in this case and we are not going to predict their number. Casualties may also occur among those who will participate in the possible actions of violence against the Armenians. That will increase the tension still more and will give radicals excellent trump cards against the governments of the countries undertaking measures for the security of their Armenian citizens. IMPACT ON KARABAGH CONFLICT Other quite serious consequences are also possible. It is known that the Islamic Conference Organization usually mentions the Karabagh conflict in the final resolutions adopted at its summits, presenting Armenia as an aggressor country, which occupied part of the territories of Muslim Azerbaijan. These resolutions are approved regularly, but there have been no serious hostile operations by the Islamic states of the Middle East against the Armenians and Armenia based on these resolutions so far. This is mostly accounted for by the fact that the overwhelming majority of the Arab countries and Iran, which has traditionally had good and even partner relations with Armenia, in fact, sabotage the fulfillment of these resolutions. But the appearance of an Armenian auxiliary military contingent in Iraq may become an essential political trump card for some concrete steps against Armenia in connection with Nagorno Karabagh for such member-countries of the Islamic Conference Organization as Pakistan (as of today, it is the only Islamic country possessing nuclear weapons) and Turkey. The question is: how much do Armenia, Nagorno Karabagh and the Armenian nation need it? It is well known that the final decision about the dispatch of the auxiliary military contingent will be made only after the National Assembly of Armenia gives its consent to this step. The opposition had boycotted the work of the parliament and it is quite obvious that this decision will be made without its participation. And the Armenian opposition has formed no exact position on the issue yet. Anyway, some MPs of the parties of the Ardarutyun (Justice) bloc (Aram G. Sargsian and Grigor Harutiunian) have already expressed a negative opinion. Quite another matter is the position of the parties of the ruling coalition. There is still nothing definite here either. Mher Shahgeldian, one of the leaders of Orinats Yerkir (Country of Law) party, Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on Defense and National Security, unconditionally supported the actions of the RA President and the RA Minister of Defense. Galust Sahakian, leader of the Republicans, expressed a view that Armenia shouldn't interfere in any actions that contain possible threat. According to G. Sahakian, Armenia will not undertake steps that will cause damage to the Armenian communities. By the way, it is known that this political figure may change his position at any moment and substantiate its change. But, the position of ARF Dashnaktsutiun, a traditional Armenian party, in our opinion, should become a central one. It is the Dashnaktsutiun that controls the moods of the overwhelming majority of the Armenian communities of the Middle East and that's why it purports to be the representative of the interests of this part of the Diaspora. The position of MP Armen Rustamian, the representative of the Executive Council of ARF Dashnaktsutiun, was, on the whole, negative. But Hrair Karapetian, an MP from the same party, didn't exclude that the leaders may have cogent arguments and will be able to persuade members of Dashnaktsutiun to approve of such a decision. It is evident from his words that the President has a chance to obtain the consent of Dashnaktsutiun to sending the Armenian servicemen to Iraq with the support of certain cogent arguments. TRADITIONAL PARTIES' POSITION INDEFINITE As of today, the position of the leadership of the Ramkavar Azatakan Party, another traditional influential Armenian party, is also indefinite. The party isn't represented in the Armenian Parliament, but it has a MP in the Lebanese Parliament (Hagop Kassardjian). Thus, the party still has some time (not too much) to clarify its position. There is no definition in the position of the third traditional Armenian Hunchak Social-Democratic party either, which is not represented in the Armenian parliament, but has an MP in the Lebanese Parliament too and represents the interests of a number of Armenian communities in the Middle East (for example, the communities of Damascus). One may only suppose that the position of the Armenian Hunchaks over this issue won't differ from that of the Justice bloc (the party is still a member of the bloc). In reality, Armenia may face serious threats to the security and life of the Armenian communities in the Middle East once it sends a military contingent to Iraq. Not only the country's President and the parties of the parliamentary majority but also the traditional Armenian parties representing the Diaspora will bear the responsibility for the consequences of such a short-sighted step. But paradoxical is the fact that today the potential threat to security and life of the Diasporan Armenians of the Middle East comes from Armenia itself. And it is the President, whose legality is put in doubt, who served as a source of the threat by making a political decision potentially dangerous for his compatriots. The Parliament can correct this mistake. But the strangest thing in this story is the fact that RA Minister of Defense Serge Sargsian, commenting about his readiness to send Armenian servicemen to Iraq, made people believe that Armenia is doing this to show that it is part of Europe. Serge Sargsian has forgotten his post-election speech of last year, in which he stated that the Armenian mentality has nothing in common with that of the same Europe. Besides, official Yerevan, as well as the electronic mass media controlled by it, keeps silent over the important circumstance that political Europe has split up over the issue of participation in the military operations in Iraq. If we follow the logic of the Minister of Defense of Armenia, it turns out that France, Germany, Belgium, the countries of Northern Europe or Spain (calling off its contingent from Iraq) are not part of Europe.

"George Bournoutian's new book, Two Chronicles on the History of Karabagh, has been published by Mazda Academic Press here. The study is an annotated English translation of the works of two Muslim historians, Mirza Jamal and Mirza Adigozal Beg, who wrote histories of Karabagh in the first half of the 19th century. Contrary to current Azeri claims, both sources detail a strong Armenian presence in Karabagh centuries before the Russian conquest of the region. Azeri academics, led by the late Ziya Buniatov, have removed most references to an Armenian presence in Karabagh in new editions of these and other primary sources. Bournoutian has used the original manuscripts in Baku and has indicated the expunged material. In addition, the book contains various other primary non-Armenian sources and, for the sake of objectivity, is practically devoid of mention of works by Armenian historians. The 300-page book includes an introduction, glossary, five maps, and an index. It can be obtained from NAASR (395 Concord Avenue, Belmont, MA 02478; 617-489-1610) or from Mazda Press (Mazda Publishers, Inc., P.O.

"Yusuf Islam, the pop star of Greek-Cypriot decent once known as Cat Stevens, was recently escorted off a Washington-bound flight for allegedly posing a threat to US national security. United Airlines Flight 919 from London was en route to Dulles International Airport when US officials matched Islam's name to a security watch-list. The plane was diverted to Maine's Bangor International Airport and was met by US federal agents. Following the ordeal, the 56-year-old British citizen, was to be sent back to London, while his 21-year-old daughter, who was travelling with him, was allowed to enter the US. US officials indicated the singer had given large amounts of money to Muslim charities that the US believes are fronts for terrorists. Furthermore, four years ago, Islam was denied entry to Israel because of allegations he had given tens of thousands of dollars to militant terrorist group Hamas. He denied the claim. Islam, who has sold more than 25 million albums, is known for the 70's hits Morning Has Broken and Wild World. Born Stephen Georgiou to a Greek Cypriot father and Swedish mother, he began singing as Cat Stevens and converted to Islam in 1977. I hope people will finally realize my life didn't as much change as develop, he said of his conversion to Islam. I made a choice to actively try to make a difference in the world, just as I wrote and sang about. The law firm of Carter Ruck is representing the singer and has asked American officials to remove his name from a no fly list and at least explain why it considered Islam a security risk. I remain bewildered by the decision of the U.S. authorities to refuse me entry to the United States, the firm quoted Islam as saying. My solicitors have now made representations to the relevant U.S. authorities and I have asked Foreign Secretary Jack Straw to continue to use his good offices in order to bring this matter to a swift conclusion.

"IRISH politicians are making frantic efforts to save British hostage Ken Bigley from being executed in Iraq. Bigley's elderly mother is from Dublin, and his brother has lobbied Irish politicians in the hope that their intervention might save his life. Bigley is entitled to carry an Irish passport himself, and his family is hoping that this will increase his chances of release. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Bertie Ahern and Labor TD Michael D. Higgins have both pleaded with the hostage takers to release the 62-year-old civil engineer. In a statement to the Arabic news station al-Jazeera, Ahern asked the men who kidnapped Bigley in Iraq to free him. There is every reason to release him and no justifiable reason for causing him harm. I would appeal to Mr. Bigley's captors to return him safe and sound to his family, Ahern said in the message taped on Friday. Ahern made the statement after pleas from the Bigley family to intervene in the hostage crisis. Lil Bigley, who is now in her 80s, was born and grew up in Ticknock, Co. Dublin. Mrs. Bigley has been hospitalized on two occasions since her son was kidnapped. Last week she also made an emotional appeal to the hostage takers to release her son. A spokesperson for Ahern said there had not been any consultation with the British or American governments on whether to respond to the interview request from al-Jazeera. Because there was an opportunity offered, the Taoiseach was happy to give a statement, said the spokesperson. The Bigley family have been extremely critical of both the British and American governments' response to the hostage crisis. Ken Bigley was kidnapped last Thursday week along with two American colleagues. Bigley's brother Paul believes that the statement from Ahem could provide the key to his brother's release. It will be very helpful indeed. The statement is a lifeline as it is arising from a bona fide government. It's all I wanted, he said. Higgins has also been making strenuous efforts to secure Bigley's release. He went on al Jazeera last week to ask that the civil engineer's life be spared. I am convinced that nothing at all will be achieved by the execution of Ken Bigley, whose aged mother is an Irish citizen, he said. Ireland took a neutral position during the U.S.-led war on Iraq. Higgins slammed the Tony Blair administration for not leaving any room for dialogue with Bigley's captors. I and the Irish government are opposed to the Blair government's decision and by the appalling actions of the Bush administration, he told Aljazeera.net in a telephone interview. We must have dialogue with Iraqi groups, like the Association of Muslim Scholars, we are all interested in a peaceful resolution and putting an end to this illegal war, he added. The decision by the British and U.S. governments not to negotiate was contradictory and appalling, he said. On Tuesday Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat also intervened in response from a letter from Higgins. Arafat has asked one of his most senior ministers to work for Bigley's release, according to the Palestinian delegate general to Ireland, Ali Halimeh. President Arafat, through one of his senior Palestinian ministers, made some contacts in Iraq in relation to the issue, he said. I hope something will happen. Paul Bigley described Arafat's intervention as fantastic news and the biggest breakthrough so far in the bid for his brother to be freed. Over 25,00 emails have been sent to al-Jazeera from Ireland calling for Bigley's release. Article copyright Irish Tribune. Photograph (Labor Party politician Michael D.

"Dan Rather had a great fall. Now that he's blown his cover of impartiality by breathlessly pedaling what practically everyone now believes to be forged documents produced to discredit George W, how long will it be before the other two evening news Humpty Dumpties fall as well? Take that ABC fella. The sole anchor for ABC since 1983, the Canadian-born, supercilious Peter Jennings finally condescended to becoming an American citizen this year. How noble. He now enjoys dual citizenship. According to a recent article by Rachel Zabarkes Friedman in the National Review, Mr. Jennings had an interesting childhood in Canada. My mother ... was pretty anti-American, Mr. Jennings told Dave Letterman in September of 2002. And so was I, in some respects, raised with Anti-Americanism in my blood, or in my mother's milk at least. Is that important? Mightily important given the fact that, despite a shrinking audience, too many Americans still get their evening news from World News Tonight. According to the Center for Media and Public Affairs, writes Ms. Friedman, the Jennings show had the most anti-war coverage of the nightly broadcasts on all three networks in both 1991 and 2003. Anti-war rallies were featured regularly, while support-the-troops gatherings were consistently ignored. Like Tom Brokaw and Mr. Rather, Mr. Jennings believes his liberal bias isn't bias at all. It's simply mainstream thinking. During the Clinton impeachment process, for example, as the senators were signing their names to the oath book promising to be fair and impartial in their decisions, Mr. Jennings went out of his way to identify each of the right-leaning Republicans as conservative. No Democrats were identified as liberal, however, not even Tom Daschle, Barbara Mikulski, Ted Kennedy or even John Kerry. In the world of the Jenningses and Brokaws and Rathers, writes Bernard Goldberg in his fascinating book, Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News, conservatives are out of the mainstream and need to be identified. Liberals on the other hand, are mainstream and don't need to be identified. Too many news people, especially the ones at worldwide headquarters in New York where all the big decisions are made, basically talk to other people just like themselves, writes Mr. Goldberg. He mentions a writer for the New Yorker who was shocked when Richard Nixon carried 49 states in the 1972 election. I can't believe it! she cried. I don't know a single person who voted for him. On June 16, writes Ms. Friedman, Mr. Jennings declared: One of the Bush administration's most controversial assertions in its argument for war was that Saddam Hussein had links to al-Queda. Today the 9/11 Commission said unequivocally, not so. Really? On page 61 of the Commission Report we read that bin Laden established the Muslim terrorist group Ansar al Islam within Iraq in 2001. There are indications that by then the Iraqi regime tolerated and may even have helped Ansar al Islam against the common Kurdish enemy. No smoking gun but hardly unequivocal, eh? Is there a vast left-wing conspiracy in the news rooms of ABC, CBS and NBC? Absolutely not. Since only liberal views are allowed to percolate within the inner sanctums of the major networks, the climate of liberalism is perceived as mainstream. Mr. Rather, for example, told Mr. Goldberg that The New York Times was middle of the road. Middle of the road? The gray lady hasn't endorsed a Republican for president in 50 years! Trying desperately to salvage Mr. Rather's credibility, a recent NYT headline read: Memoes on Bush Are Fake But Accurate. Sounds Kerryesque. How mainstream has Mr. Jennings been during his 21-year reign as ABC news guru? Consider the following Jennings reporting gems tallied by Media Reality Check. Castro the Great: Medical care was once for the privileged few. Today it is available to every Cuban and it is free. Some of Cuba's health care is world class. In heart disease, for example, in brain surgery. Health and education are the revolution's great success stories. (June 15, 1989). Right. Soviet health care was once world class, too, remember? With Soviet doctors no longer performing medical miracles, perhaps Americans with heart problems can now be treated in Cuba. Intolerant Republicans: We begin tonight with what you could call zero tolerance ... Today by the time Mr. [Bob] Dole spoke by satellite to his party delegates, who were already gathered in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had disappeared from the party's platform. (August 6, 1996) Hey, Mr. Jennings, how come you never mention the fact that no pro-life speakers have ever been allowed to speak at Democrat conventions? Soviet Pussycats: There are some of you, I'm sure, who remember the days when we in the West were afraid that the Soviet Union would outdo the West technologically. They had been first in space. The CIA was pretty impressed, remember? And then the Soviet Union fell apart and we discovered how far behind they were ... Ah yes, we used to take the Soviet Union so seriously. (July 7, 2000). Golly, Miss Molly. How silly of some of you to have worried about the Soviet Union which had dozens of client states on four continents, ballistic missiles aimed at our major cities, and the largest military arsenal in the world. The ancient Greeks had a word for what ails our three Humpty Dumpties: hubris. Fortunately for those who still believe journalistic ethics is not an oxymoron, ABC, NBC and CBS no longer dominate the air waves with their unbiased, middle-of-the-road reporting. The Humpty Dumpties have either fallen or are teetering. Cable networks such as Fox News are taking their place. Blogs on the Internet are doing their part. One day, one can only hope, Messrs. Jennnings and Brokaw will either repent or fall, victims of their own bloviating bias. Humpties may soon become Dumpties, and no one, not even George Soros and Michael Moore, will put them back together again. Myron Kuropas's e-mail address is: kuropas@comcast.net.

"Art of the Armenians, an exhibition of manuscript painting and book bindings, woodcarvings and icons, dating from the 12th to the 18th centuries, is being staged by Sam Fogg, 15d Clifford Street, London Wl, from Thursday, September 23 to Friday, October 15, 2004. Armenian art of the classical period has only survived in very small numbers so this exhibition, the first ever to be held by a commercial gallery, comprises twenty items of great rarity and has taken over ten years to assemble. It is offered for sale as a collection. On the far eastern edge of the Christian world, often isolated or overwhelmed by Muslim cultures, the Armenians have produced a distinctive artistic tradition unlike any other. The collection assembled by Sam Fogg begins with objects from the great medieval periods in Greater Armenia and the Kingdom of Cilicia. Later centuries are represented by paintings and books created in communities dominated by other cultures or far from the homeland, such as a series of manuscripts from Constantinople. The Armenians' need to preserve and record their culture through difficult times has resulted in detailed inscriptions mapping the history of each item. The Armenian artists were widely spread owing to a Diaspora over many centuries, and the exhibition demonstrates how they enriched their work by taking inspiration from the forms of Persian, Turkish, Greek and Western European painting. However, these influences were always absorbed and changed into a distinct Armenian art. At some periods, their books, in particular, can be described as one of the great art forms of the world. The earliest and most prized piece in the show is a monumental wooden panel or door carved with scenes from the vision of Daniel. The khatchkar, or carved cross, is the preeminent sculptural expression of the Armenians, a form that reached its peak in the 12th and 13th centuries. Free standing or embedded into the walls of churches, almost all surviving examples are made of stone and so this panel, nearly two meters high and deeply carved in walnut, is exceptionally rare. The subject matter, details of the costume and style of the carving suggest a possible connection with the great monastery of Haghpat founded by Queen Khosrovanush, and radio carbon dating of the wood has confirmed it to be from the 12th century. When it was on show in the exhibition Treasure from the Ark at the British Library in 2001, it was proposed that it might have been carved at the time of the restoration of the monastery in 1188. A manuscript of exceptional historical and artistic importance is a 15th century Gospel book with paintings by the scribe and painter Ghazar. Gospel books were as central to the faith and culture of the Armenians as icons were to the Byzantines, and this beautiful example includes, in addition to Ghazar's work, four cut-down decorated pages on parchment from two separate Cilician Gospel books of the 12th century that were inserted at the time of production. These are of luxurious quality and date from one of the most glorious periods of Armenian history. Another Gospel book of exceptional richness and quality is an example of the grandest manuscripts produced in later centuries by the Armenian Diaspora in Constantinople. Decorated on parchment circa 1620-30, it has 34 large paintings and more than 150 marginal pictures. It is prefaced with a cycle of paintings from the Life of Christ followed by a series of canon tables, the brilliant, saturated colors and lavish ornament of which reproduce the visual impact of 13th-century Cilician paintings. A book of Psalms written on parchment in 1659 and signed by the painter Markos 'the illuminator' in Constantinople is inscribed ...in the tyranny of the Muslim Sultan Mehmet at a harsh and difficult time when we were afflicted and oppressed by the impious ones... Four other books illuminated by Markos are now in the monastery of St. James in Jerusalem, one containing a detailed and abusive description of the painter's greed but acknowledging his great skill. An icon of the Virgin and Child from the Treasury of Etchmiadzin is one of the oldest Armenian icons to survive. It was painted in 1696 by Naghash Hovnat'an (1661-1722), the founder and most distinguished of the famous schools of painters of that name. He was the leading Armenian artist of the period and painted an image on the front of the high altar and much of the dome of the St. Etchmiadzin Cathedral. He lived and worked in Erevan where he was, for a period, Court artist to the Georgian King Vaktang VI. The exhibition is accompanied by a scholarly catalogue written by Dr. Vrej Nersessian, curator of the Armenian Collections at the British Library. Art of the Armenians provides a rare opportunity not only to admire the beauty of these works of art but also to appreciate and better understand the culture of a nation whose people have bravely survived centuries of conquest and conflict. Very little Armenian art is accessible to the public and certainly not in this country. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2004-09-11,1
"A DUBLIN-based Islamic militant linked to the group al-Muhajiroun has defended those who took part in the Beslan massacre in Russia. Anjem Choudary, who claims to have recruited Irish members to the terrorist group, insists that the horrific siege at the school last week which left some 400 people dead and hundreds more fighting for life was justified. Choudary, who came to prominence after appearing on the chat show The Late Late Show, claimed that Russian security fired first and the militants were justified in returning fire. They had legitimate grievances. At this school there were more adults than children, he said. Muslims have a perfectly legitimate right to retaliate. The rules of Sharia law are not laid down to say you cannot attack a hospital or school. What about the carpet-bombing of Afghanistan and Iraq by British forces? There is a war taking place between Muslims and non-Muslims in Russia. As long as your main target is not children that is acceptable. Choundary, who has very little support among the Muslim community in Ireland, is constantly monitored by the police in Dublin. Meanwhile, thousands of people across Ireland have been paying their respects to those who died and were injured in the siege. A book of condolence was opened in the Mansion House in Dublin so that people could send messages of support to the families of the bereaved and injured. Hundreds more queued at the Russian Embassy to express their solidarity with the people of Beslan. At midday on Tuesday, September 7, a minute of silence was held in primary schools across Ireland. Many teachers spent a great deal of time over the past few days helping young people to try and comprehend the awful events that they witnessed on their television screens and in newspapers, said teachers union president Austin Corcoran. Teachers feel a sense of shared loss at the deaths of so many colleagues and their pupils in such horrific circumstances, he added. The Irish Red Cross has begun an appeal to raise funds to help the victims in Beslan. Article copyright Irish Tribune.

"The nation of Turkey cannot consider itself a true democracy, as it does not tolerate the freedoms of speech and expression, which are the basic tenets of a democratic system. The powerful Turkish military has taken over the government three times since the 1970s. As M.L. Rossi rhetorically asked in her book, What Every American Should Know About the Rest of the World, Is it a democracy or a military government enforcing what it thinks is democracy? (158). The Turkish government refuses to admit to its actions as the perpetrators in the Armenian Genocide of 1915. As such, it does not tolerate any of its citizens or those of other nations to commemorate the Genocide through venues such as writing, theatre, speech, or artwork. Books have been banned, records destroyed, theatre productions stopped, and ties with nations broken, all in the hope that the world would forget that the Genocide occurred and Turkey might remain the only alleged Muslim democracy in the world. Turkey is also undemocratic in that it does not grant the country's Kurdish population rights despite the fact that they make up one-fifth of the country's population. Kurdish-language television and schools are not permitted. Writing about the Kurds and their situation is banned in the country and those who do not abide by that decree face harsh punishment carried out by the Turkish military, as they are the ones that form the backbone of the supposedly democratic, but truly militaristic, government. MILITARY RULE UNDER DEMOCRATIC GUISE Turkey claims to be a democratic nation, yet its actions denote those of a military government. The freedoms of speech and expression have been denied to those who write and publish books relating to the Armenian Genocide and the poor treatment of the Kurds. Because the government will not actually admit to its actions of banning and burning books, since it claims to be a true democracy, the powerful Turkish military takes over this duty. Publishere are convicted if they publish books about the massacre of the Armenians. Authors, too, are harassed by the military. Kemal Yalcin, a writer of Turkish descent, wrote a book entitled You Rejoice My Heart, a collection of personal interviews with Armenian survivors of the Genocide. After being run out of Turkey for his revolutionary journalism several years prior to publishing this latest work, he returned to his homeland, Turkey, to have his book published. However, three days before his book was set to be released in Turkey in 2001, all copies of it were shredded (Goshert). The basic rights of humans to express themselves through writing were denied by enigmatic military plotting. Furthermore, when Fatih Tas, the publisher of Noam Chomsky's book, American Interventionism, attempted to publish the work, he was tried in court because of the chapters on anti-Kurd brutality carried out by the Turkish military. The nation of Turkey holds so tightly to the term democracy yet is slothful in keeping the principles that form a democratic system. A nation in which one cannot publish and distribute documents of truth should not be allowed to call itself a democracy. In addition to banning and destroying books, the Turkish government also stops theatre productions from being performed, another variety of denying the freedom of expression. The government repressed the play, Beast on the Moon, a work in which the two main characters are survivors of the Armenian Genocide. The play was being directed by Knut Weber in Germany and was scheduled to perform at the European Culture Days Festival of Karlsruhe. The Armenian Reporter Int'l stated on May 22, 2004 that When Beast on the Moon appeared in the schedule of plays to be presented, Weber received a phone call from a Mr. Kuk, who is the city's Consul General to Turkey, and thus a representative of the Turkish government in Ankara. He informed Weber that, if the Festival presented Beast on the Moon, Turkey would officially boycott the entire Festival (1). EFFORTS TOWARD CONTINUED GENOCIDE DENIAL Turkey feared that the presentation of this play would undermine their efforts of denying the Genocide and trying to get the world to forget that it occurred. As Stephen Feinstein, Director of the Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at the University of Minnesota, stated, Artists are not easily co-opted, they have certain insights, and someone with a totalitarian mind will see the worst, and someone with a democratic mind will see the best (quoted in The Armenian Reporter Int'l 15). The play has already won thirty awards, five of which are equivalent to the American Tony award. Those that view the play democratically and accept its message clearly see it as an exemplary work while those, such as Turkey, who choose to view it as a threat only prove further their non-democratic outlooks. By forcing Mr. Weber to withdraw the play from the Festival, Turkey proved that they do not truly believe in the tenets of democracy. As Mr. Weber said, A country which denies its own history has a problem with democracy. Ankara and the Turkish Consulate responded very toughly and took the tone of a dictatorship, which is not like a democracy (quoted in The Armenian Reporter Int'l 15). Turkey cannot hope to be regarded as a democracy by the international community by hiding its past. Denying the right of freedom of expression only proves that Turkey is not yet capable of being called a true democracy. Turkey has also tried to hide its past by interfering with commemorations of the Genocide in countries neighboring Turkey. For example, on April 17, 2004, Poland planned to commemorate the Armenian Genocide with the unveiling of a stone cross, or khatchkar. Turkey tried to stop the memorial from mentioning the word genocide and was active in interfering with the plans for the occasion. The word was ultimately used in the engraving on the stone, but only after much hassle with the opposed Turkish government. As one Polish clerk asked upon reflecting on this matter, 'Why are the Turks afraid of the facts? They could simply admit what they did and the present-day conflict could be avoided' (Karayan 3). The commemoration ceremony also brought up the topic of the disappearance of a Polish historian in Turkey. Students present at the Genocide commemoration passed out fliers about Rafal Yedrashik, who was in Turkey in the summer of 2002 to make a film about the Armenian Genocide at the time of his disappearance. Neither the Turkish government nor the military has made comments about Yedrashik's whereabouts or their connection to his mysterious disappearance. Turkey continually tries to stop all forms of remembrance and teaching of the Genocide, proving further the existence of a militaristic government system. EFFECT ON RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES Not only does Turkey cause rifts between itself and individual groups and people, but it also does so with entire nations. Each time that a nation resolves to officially use the term genocide when referring to the killings of Armenians in 1915, Turkey shows some form of opposition and acts undemocratically. Two nations which recently passed bills recognizing the Armenian Genocide are France and Canada. In May of 1998, France's parliament passed a bill recognizing the Genocide. It was reported by Reuters on May 29, 1998 that Turkey has warned France against passing the bill, saying trade and diplomatic relations would suffer, (1) and indeed, they did. The Turkish military enforced a campaign to boycott all goods with a French label. Two of the main products that were boycotted include wine and textiles. Turkey also drafted a plan to refuse to enter into contracts concerning defense with France. In April of 2004, Canada officially recognized the Genocide, but not without strong resistance and many threats from the supposedly democratic Turkish government. Turkey publicly stated, ...the federal Canadian politicians will bear the responsibility of all the negative consequences that this resolution will bring (Mooradian 2). They also attempted to force a change through business contracts, similar to what they had done with France. A $335 million contract and another of close to $1 billion were placed in jeopardy to underscore the way Turkey felt about Canada's recognition of the Genocide. When the United States tried to help the Kurds in Turkey through Operation Provide Comfort, they were not successful as they were in Iraq. The Turkish government threatened the United States by claiming they would not allow the U.S. to use integral Turkish airbases. Because of this, the United States did not help the Kurds free themselves from Turkish rule. The ways in which Turkey's government reacted to other nations' recognition of the Genocide and the desire for a separate Kurdistan indicate Turkey's fear of culpability and its lack of democratic principles. TIME TO FOLLOW LEAD OF GERMANY AND THE US Surely the Turkish government should realize that other nations have committed similar actions, admitted to their wrongdoings, and are still well established in the international community despite their brutal pasts. For example, two such nations are Germany and the United States of America. Germany, after carrying out the mass killings of people of Jewish descent and other minorities, collectively known as the Holocaust, admitted to its murderous actions. However, the German mea maxima culpa after the war did not prohibit the country from becoming the third most technologically powerful country in the world, following the United States and Japan. The United States has always had a conflict-prone relationship with the Native Americans. Thousands of deaths of Native Americans have been recorded and attributed to white Americans. However, regardless of the brutality of its past, the United States is the most powerful country in the world in many regards. This nation redressed its wrongs by allocating land for the Native Americans and exempting them from paying taxes. Unlike Germany and the United States of America, which acted democratically to admit to their pasts, Turkey denies all accusations of genocide and unwarranted killing of Kurds. Turkey works tirelessly to prevent the international acknowledgement of their brutality and therefore should not be considered a democracy. Works Cited Goshert, Jake.

"George W. Bush wants America to prevail in the struggle between the forces of extremism and moderation. To meet that challenge, US policies must reflect knowledge of the forces at play in the Middle East. Unfortunately, support has slumped for US policies in the region. Yet, there remains a respect and even admiration for some American values: liberty, equality of opportunity and scientific and economic accomplishments. The main problems the region faces include the Arab-Israeli conflict, Iraq and the need for political and economic reforms. Like it or not, Arabs and most Muslims see America as biased towards Israel, as an occupier, not a liberator, in Iraq, and as an accomplice of many autocratic regimes in Arab and Muslim countries. These three challenges are interconnected, although each maintains its own historic and cultural context and must be dealt with concomitantly. It is wrong, therefore, to propose, as some do, that final resolution of the Palestinian issue, for example, can await democratic reform in the Arab world - or that progress on Arab reform should await resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Furthermore, while these three issues are not, intrinsically, the causes of terrorism, Islamic extremists exploit them fully. The US must take the lead in galvanizing a truly multilateral diplomatic effort to address fully these key challenges at the political, economic, social and cultural levels. The Muslim world is experiencing an ideological struggle between extremists and moderates, and the international community has a vital stake in its outcome. A comprehensive strategy to meet these challenges should encompass, first, action under the aegis of the quartet of Middle East mediators - the US, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations - along with the Palestinian authorities, to build on the Gaza withdrawal proposed by Ariel Sharon, Israeli prime minister. The principal issue is how to move from unilateral disengagement to trilateral engagement among the Israelis, the Palestinians and the international community. If properly managed, Mr. Sharon's plan offers opportunities that could lead back to direct Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and realizing the two-state vision. Key issues that need to be addressed are economic rehabilitation and development, security and third-party presence and monitoring. A third party is essential in achieving progress and, here again, the US must take the lead. Second, in Iraq, we must not make the quest for perfection the enemy of the good. Saddam Hussein has been deposed and extremists, either secular or religious, must not have the opportunity to fill that void. Serious errors have been made in the approach to post-war Iraq and valuable time has been lost. America's image has been badly tarnished by the prisoner abuse and torture scandal. Given the realities on the ground, the administration is now rightfully tempering the neo-conservatives' democratic ambitions for Iraq by promoting a political transition that features a duly elected consensual government representative of Iraq's diverse population. But without restoration of public security and creation of jobs and economic progress, achievement of political goals will remain tenuous. Third, the Bush administration has rightly identified political and economic reform in the Middle East as a key objective. However, there has to be a buy-in from the countries involved. Reforms cannot be imposed. The values the US stands for are an essential element of this struggle for ideas aimed at the lack of democratic political institutions, independent judiciaries and the rule of law. The absence of such reforms directly affects America's own internal as well as international security, as witnessed by the string of terrorist attacks around the world from September 11, 2001. Along with its allies, especially the Europeans, the US needs to make this a main policy objective and put it on the bilateral agenda with Middle Eastern countries with the clear message that the overall relationship with the US will be affected not only by political, military and commercial ties but also by their action on reforms. The task is urgent. The US must take an active lead in building international consensus on these issues. The world has a vital stake in the outcome. By coordinating US policies and public diplomacy along these lines, the administration can set forth a renewed sense of strategic direction in US policy toward the Arab and Muslim world.

"Lonnie Duka's first trip to Armenia simply changed him. The country changed me and the contrast within the country changed me, explained the Laguna Beach, Calif.-based commercial photographer who volunteered to visually record the AECP's 24th mission to Armenia. In the countryside, running water and electricity are newfound luxuries. There's a certain amount of strength, resiliency and self-determination, almost more so in the war-torn areas. Duka arrived in Armenia without preconceived notions about the country and its people. I came with very little geographical or cultural feeling for it, he explained. However, after spending five days in Yerevan and five days in Karabagh documenting the AECP's efforts, Duka said, The American doctors were over there to teach, but my impression was that we could export some of the Armenian people's sense of warmth and compassion over here. A Muslim of Albanian heritage, Duka volunteered because of his tremendous personal regard for AECP President Roger Ohanesian. Duka, who has donated his time to organizations for ten years, was impressed with the AECP. The doctors themselves paid for their own airfare and their own hotels. Their direct efforts result in patient care, not in politics. Duka also lauded the AECP doctors and office staff in Armenia. The Armenian doctors were remarkable. They were inclusive in everything they did. Describing the physicians as a warm people with a deep level of gratitude and an extraordinary level of professionalism, Duka was deeply touched when four surgeons arrived at 4 a.m. to accompany the AECP medical mission members to the airport. The office staff members in Yerevan also supported the team's efforts. The people in the AECP Yerevan office are remarkably well organized. They seem to handle multiple challenges well, Duka explained. There was a tremendous amount of logistics involved for me to do my job; it was effortless for me to ask for their help. The professional photographer described Yerevan as a study in contrasts and added: You can't help but see that 50 years of Soviet domination have taken their toll. Buildings are crumbling. Nevertheless, Duka saw a new sense of optimism, at least in Yerevan. Cafes are opening, people are out, and they're stylishly dressed. Duka described the residents of Yerevan and Karabagh as tremendously gregarious, remarkably warm people who invited us into their homes. The AECP medical team visited some poverty-stricken patients in their residences. They simply wouldn't let us leave without entertaining us in some manner. To learn more about the AECP, interested persons should visit www.eyecareproject.com, or call 949-675-5767.

"Dr. Hratch Tchilingirian lectured recently at Haigazian University on The Armenian Community of Abkhazia. Tchilingirian, formerly of Boston, is Research Fellow and Associate Director of Projects of the Eurasia Program at the Judge Institute of Management, University of Cambridge. He received his PhD from the London School of Economics and Political Science in February 2003. The title of his dissertation was The Struggle for Independence in Post-Soviet South Caucasus: Karabagh and Abkhazia. Tchilingirian's research interests include political and territorial disputes in the Caucasus and Central Asia and their impact on economic and geo-strategic developments, the affairs of the Armenian Church and the Diaspora. His numerous analytical articles and reports have appeared in journals and publications in Europe, North America and the Middle East. Tchilingirian's talk on the Armenians of Abkhazia was partly based on his two-week trip to Abkhazia in the summer of 2003. Tchilingirian first described the overall situation in Abkhazia, which lies on the northeastern shores of the Black Sea and has a territory of 8,600 sq km. Abkhazia was an autonomous republic within Georgia during the Soviet period. With its wonderful climate and developed infrastructure for tourism, it was considered the Riviera of the Soviet Union. Successive Soviet leaders from Stalin onwards had their summer resorts in Abkhazia. About 1.5 million tourists visited Abkhazia annually in Soviet times, when its total population was only half a million. Agriculture was also a very successful sector of the economy, and Abkhazia had one of the highest GDPs in the Soviet Union. The Abkhaz form a separate ethno-linguistic group in the North Caucasus, said Tchilingirian. Ancient Greek and Roman chronicles already mention them as living in this area. Sixty percent of the Abkhaz nominally follow the Byzantine Orthodox tradition of Christianity. Abkhazia came under Ottoman rule in the fifteenth century and stayed as such in the next few hundred years. Some forty percent of the Abkhazians now are Muslims. However, both Christian and Muslim Abkhazians remain attached to their earlier pagan rites. There is no mosque, for example, on the territory of Abkhazia, which was conquered by the Russians in the early nineteenth century. The lecturer explained that the Abkhaz had been a minority in their autonomous republic in Soviet times, forming only 18 percent of the total population. Georgians were the majority. Throughout the Soviet period, inter-ethnic problems existed between the two communities, leading to the emergence of an Abkhaz secessionist movement. One of the key grievances of the Abkhazians was the systematic policy of Georgianization, which restricted the use of the Abkhaz language and culture. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, a war erupted between the Abkhaz and the Georgians. It ended in an Abkhaz victory, but at the high cost of many deaths and destruction. Tchilingirian continued, saying that, despite the presence of a cease-fire and observers representing the United Nations and the Commonwealth of Independent States (the latter, largely Russians), sporadic clashes do continue in the bordering region of Gali. Some 60,000 Georgians have recently been permitted to resettle in the Gali region, but another 250,000-275,000 Georgians, who fled Abkhazia during the war, remain refugees. Hence, the overall population of Abkhazia has gone down in recent years. According to official figures, there are now 350,000 inhabitants in Abkhazia. However, Tchilingirian stated that unofficial figures put the number at 250,000, which is more realistic. The parliament has passed a law making Abkhaz the primary language in the country and rendering its teaching mandatory in all schools. However, there are not enough qualified teachers to teach the native language, and the Abkhaz generally remain Russophone, especially in the cities. Moreover, there has been a very sharp economic decline since the war. People now largely subsist on private, small-scale agriculture. Not much reconstruction is going on, and many of the buildings damaged during the war are still not repaired, especially in Sukhumi, the capital. Post-war Abkhazia is completely dependent on Russia. It carries on most of its trade with its large northern neighbor and uses the Russian ruble as its currency. The Abkhaz are also following Russian time, which has two hours' difference from Georgia. There are some signs that the economy, especially tourism, is gradually picking up, explained Tchilingirian. Some 300,000 tourists from Russia visited Gagra from January to August 2003, a much cheaper destination compared to similar locations in Russia. Moreover, Russian companies are now investing in tourism and energy exploration in Abkhazia. Tchilingirian then focused on the Armenians living in Abkhazia, who, he said, feel isolated from and are largely forgotten by fellow Armenians both in Armenia and in the rest of the Diaspora. Armenians have lived in Abkhazia for about 150 years, said Tchilingirian. Although Armenian merchants had established a small community there in the Middle Ages, the first wave of the ancestors of modern-day Armenians in Abkhazia arrived only in the 1880s, fleeing the regions of Trabzon, Ordu and Samsun-Jenik in the Ottoman Empire. A second wave followed after the genocide of 1915, especially from Artvin. Hence, the Armenians of Abkhazia descend mostly from the region of Hamshen, but unlike the Islamized Hemshin living in Turkey and Adjaria today, the Hamshen Armenians of Abkhazia remain Christian. Tchilingirian underlined the fact that, after the flight of the Georgians, Armenians now form about 30 percent of the population of Abkhazia. According to official figures, Armenians number about 100,000 out of the total 350,000 inhabitants of Abkhazia. The lecturer gives more credence, however, to the estimate of 60,000-80,000 Armenians currently living in Abkhazia, out of a total estimated population of 250,000. The Armenian presence is significant in Sukhumi, Gudauta, Gagra and their vicinities, while Armenians living previously in and around Ochamchira have left their homes. There are now around 50-60 Armenian villages in Abkhazia, while, in the past, that number was as high as 100. Moreover, Armenians living in the city of Adler in southern Russia have family ties with the Armenians in Abkhazia. Tchilingirian explained that even after the expulsion of the Georgians, Abkhazians now only form a plurality in their country and are destined to remain less than half the total population in the foreseeable future. Following the Armenians, the Russians are now the third largest group. The Abkhaz are trying to forge close ties with the other minorities in their republic, and, hence, the Armenians can play a significant role in the country's internal and external politics. The strong Armenian voice in Abkhaz politics is also conditioned by the extensive Armenian participation in the Abkhaz war against Georgia. There were two Armenian battalions, totaling 1500 soldiers, in the Abkhaz army, which consisted of 6,000-7,000 soldiers. The Armenians sustained 240 dead, and there are now about 300 crippled former Armenian fighters. Twenty Armenians were made heroes of Abkhazia, the highest honor in the country, while 70 others received other decorations. There are currently three Armenian deputies in the Abkhaz Parliament, which consists of 35 members. Among them is Galust Trapizonian, who lost his leg fighting in the war. Other Armenians serve in the ministries and town councils. In Gagra, Armenians form 40 percent of the population, and Ishkhanuhi Kasian is the city's deputy mayor. Eight out of the Gagra town council's 28 members are Armenian, while Arsen Altunian is the deputy commander of Abkhazia's small air force. There are currently 41 Armenian all-day schools in Abkhazia, said Tchilingirian, with 3180 students and 640 teachers. Before the war, there were 52 Armenian schools. These schools are now being sponsored by the community's two main organizations, Krunk (founded in Sukhumi in 1994) and Mashtots (formed in Gagra in 1989). The Abkhaz government is providing 50 percent of the salaries of the teachers, while the other half is being supplied by the parents of the students. Almost all teachers in these schools are Armenian, with very few Russians and Abkhaz. The difficulties these schools face range from organizing an up-to-date curriculum and acquiring textbooks to coping with the lack of qualified teachers and money to repair the damage caused to the buildings during the war. For example, the Hovhannes Tumanian school in the mostly Armenian inhabited village of Alakhadzi, south of Gagra, was renovated in 2003 only after the principal found a benefactor, a graduate of this school, who is now a successful businessman in the Czech Republic. In recent years, the Armenian schools in Abkhazia have been receiving textbooks from Armenia, but the shipment costs from Yerevan have to be covered by the local community. Tchilingirian told the audience that cultural life in the Armenian community of Abkhazia is only developing gradually. The Tsovashunch song and dance ensemble has been organized in Sukhumi, and there is a bilingual (Armenian-Russian) newspaper, Hamshen, published and edited by Artavazd Saretsian and his wife, Gohar. They receive no financial assistance and rely solely on subscription fees and the sale of individual issues. There are extremely few paid advertisements published in the newspaper. Tchilingirian explained that Saretsian has an old computer, on which the newspaper is prepared. Once a month, Gohar takes the diskette to the nearby Russian city of Sochi. She returns to Sochi a week later to take the 2000 printed copies for distribution in Abkhazia, bribing the Russian border guards along the way. Artavazd Saretsian is a poet and a member of the Armenian section of the writers' union in Abkhazia. He has translated Abkhazian sayings and short stories into Armenian. Besides the newspaper, he also publishes books. There are two Armenian church buildings in Sukhumi and Gagra, but they have no full-time priests. Armenian clerics from the neighboring region of Krasnodar in Russia visit the community from time to time. Tchilingirian explained that Armenian activities are hampered due to the lack of official links between Armenia and Abkhazia. The Armenian government does not wish to annoy Tbilisi. Like all former Soviet republics, Armenia had its own summer resort in Abkhazia, the Armenia Hotel, where the Soviet Armenian elite passed its summer vacations. Since the war, the Armenian government has practically given up its rights over this hotel so as not to be forced to sign any agreement with the Abkhaz government, which is not recognized by Georgia. The hotel has now been leased for 25 years to the Abkhaz army. In the question-and-answer session, which followed the lecture, Tchilingirian emphasized that Armenian community leaders are unhappy with the lack of interest that both the government of Armenia and the Holy See of Echmiadzin show towards them. In the absence of Armenian priests, some Armenians hold their weddings and baptisms in the local Orthodox churches. Moreover, he made it clear that while the dialect of the Armenians in Abkhazia is closer to Western Armenian, the language taught at the Armenian schools is the standard Eastern Armenian. Armenians are engaged in agricultural trade and many own cafes along the seashore. During the war years, some 15,000-20,000 Armenians migrated to Russia, and many of the youth continue to see no prospects for the future, a feature that deeply concerns the community leaders. In the past, most Armenians in Abkhazia used to study in the institutions of higher learning in Armenia. These graduates continue to hold the important positions in the community. However, the Armenian government has ceased providing full scholarships to Armenians from Abkhazia in the past 2-3 years, resulting in a sharp decline in the number of Armenians from Abkhazia specializing in Yerevan. This feature will undoubtedly adversely affect the teaching of Armenian subjects in Abkhazia in the future, said Tchilingirian. Abkhazia has its own university from Soviet times, but its educational standards are not high. When a member of the audience asked about new religious movements, the lecturer explained that the Abkhaz government has passed laws against the spread of religious cults. Indeed, as an unrecognized state, Abkhazia has avoided the scrutiny of international human rights organizations. Finally, Tchilingirian informed the audience that presidential elections would be held in Abkhazia in October, and various Abkhaz factions are now courting the estimated 30,000 Armenian voters. Some political parties from Armenia are also trying to establish themselves in Abkhazia, but these efforts have received a mixed reaction within the local Armenian community.

"The despotic Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and the autocratic Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev are two strange characters known for their erratic behavior and impromptu contradictory policy statements. They sway according to their audience and often change direction - sometimes in the middle of a presentation - to please the power centers in Washington, Moscow, Peking or EU countries. Coming to power as the result of military coups or palace intrigues, neither of them is to be trusted, and their own compatriots do not support them, either. In order to facilitate political control over their respective countries, not long ago they cooperated with terrorists, religious extremist or nationalist groups. Ironically, both men continue to enjoy Washington's political and military backing, mostly due to geopolitical considerations. Consecutive U.S. administrations did not hesitate to give their support and backing to Karachi leaders when; Pakistani and Indian armed forces came very close to military confrontation. COURTING WASHINGTON & ISLAMISTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. In the same context, thanks to proven Azeri and Caspian oil reserves, Azerbaijani leaders not only secured Washington's support, but were also able to attract the attention of the high-profile Washington politicians and lobbyists. Since the inception of the BTC (Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan) pipeline projects, well-known politicians, such as Henry Kissinger, James Baker, Lloyd Bentsen, John Sununu, Richard Perle, Richard Armitage, Brent Scowcroft, and Zbigniew Brzezinski even paid them homage. It is interesting to note that, while cultivating friendly relations with the U.S., both the Pakistani and Azerbaijani leaders continued to cooperate with radical Islamic elements for quite some time. Their involvement with Taliban and Al Qaeda at that time was not a concern before the - 9/11 incidents. It is not a secret that, during the Soviet control of Afghanistan (1974-1989), the U.S. supported Pakistan to arm and train Afghani mujahidins and Islamic fighters, including Taliban factions, to fight against the Soviet-installed Communist puppet regime. Most interestingly, CIA money was, used to construct those famous Tora Bora mountain-hideouts for Taliban forces. Thanks to the active support of the U.S., the Soviets lost the war and left Afghanistan two years before the demise of the U.S.S.R. After the departure of the Russians, a civil war broke out in Afghanistan, and fragmented Afghani factions, led by several warlords, started to fight one other until the most radical Islamic elements, known as the Taliban movement, prevailed and established a new Islamic state. Supported by Pakistan, the Taliban movement was the enemy not only of godless communism but also of the entire Christian-Western civilization. An emerging new leader named Osama bin Laden, the CEO of Islamic terrorism and Taliban, now turned his wrath against the most powerful centers of the Western-Christian world, the U.S. and Russia, and called for a Holy War against the interests of the U.S. and Russia everywhere. The rest is history... AL QAEDA ENJOYS AZERBAIJAN'S SUPPORT. Al Qaeda supported Chechen terrorists, bombed apartment buildings deep in Russia and took hostages in hospitals, schools and theaters. The same Al Qaeda trained Islamic fanatics planned the 9/11 bombing of the Twin Towers and Pentagon. Both U.S, and Russia finally realized that Chechen terrorism in Russia and radical Islamic terrorism in the U.S. are the work of the same hate groups that are targeting the entire civilized world. Azerbaijani leaders, close friends of Pakistanis, were also cooperating and working with Al Qaeda activists. Islamic radicals continued to use the Azeri capital, Baku, as a transit point for money-laundering and drug-smuggling operations, to raise money for the Islamic terrorist network. Al Qaeda terrorist cells assisted in the training and arming of Chechen, Kashmiri, Turkish, Azeri, Malaysian, Yemeni, and Sudanese terrorists as part of the global network of terror. Al Qaeda trained and supported Afghani terrorist mercenaries and Mujahidins established an office in Baku in 1992. AL QAEDA & AZERIS AGAINST KARABAGH. They supported Azeri war efforts with direct participation in combat against Karabagh Armenians in 1993-1994. In the late summer of 1993, Gulbuddin Hekmetyar, the former darling of the CIA and Pakistan's Secret Services, was involved in recruiting Afghan mercenaries to fight in Mountainous Karabagh against Armenians. They were promised a bonus of $5,000 each, upon completion of their contracts. According to Russian intelligence services, more than 1,500 Afghan terrorists entered Azerbaijan in September 1993, and they played a key role in the capturing of Goradiz, a town southeast of Nagorno Karabagh's capital, Stepanakert. According to the same Russian intelligence reports, the number of Afghan terrorists later increased to 2,500. After suffering heavy casualties in the battle with the Karabagh Armenians, the Afghani brigade in the Azeri army was dissolved in 1994 just before the May cease-fire accord was signed between the Armenians and the Azeris. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda-trained Afghan, Chechen and Azeri terrorists conducted a series of bombings of trains, rail lines and gas pipelines and disrupted Armenia's fuel and supplies coming from Russia via Georgia from 1993 to 1994 (According to unnamed sources, terrorism stopped after Armenian intelligence services managed to place bombs in Baku's subway system and messages were heard loud and clear). JOINT DECLARATION OF MUSHARRAF & ALIYEV. After reviewing Pakistani and Azerbaijani involvement with the radical Islamic terrorist movement, it is interesting to study the joint declaration of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Baku on July 8, 2004. According to the communiqué, they discussed regional security issues, international terrorism, and war in Afghanistan and Iraq; signed bilateral agreements to cooperate in military training, arms production, energy sector, oil production and transportation ventures, and lastly promised to support one another's position in the Jammu/Kashmir and Nagorno-Karabagh disputes. Demanding self-determination rights for the Muslim population living in the Indian province of Jammu Kashmir, Musharraf is contradicting himself by denying self-determination rights to the Karabagh Armenians. His call for Azerbaijani territorial integrity and promise of military assistance to Azerbaijan by liberating Karabagh from the Armenians indicates he does not realize that New Delhi may apply the same principles in Jammu Kashmir, which could put an end to Pakistani control in the western section of Kashmir. Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev is also contradicting himself by calling for self-determination rights for the Muslim population in the Indian province of Jammu Kashmir. He is not only violating India's territorial integrity but is also giving legal ground for Armenia to support self-determination rights for the Karabagh Armenians in the same context. JAMMU KASHMIR & KARABAGH: A CASE OF DOUBLE STANDARDS. It is not a secret that, as if 1990, the Pakistanis, besides supporting Islamic radicals in Afghanistan, planned and organised secessionist terrorism in the Indian province of Jammu Kashmir as well, where the majority of the population is Muslim. Pakistani-sponsored terrorism took the lives of thousands of peaceful Hindus. The Islamic terrorists have indulged wantonly in abduction, rape, murder, arson, looting and extortion, to terrorize the Hindus. Destruction of Hindu cultural monuments and shrines has been widespread. According to Indian government statistics, more than 350,000 peaceful Hindu residents have had to flee their homes in Kashmir. Pakistani dictators from Mohammed Ayub Khan to General Agha Mohammed Khan, from Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to General Mohammed Zia ul-Haq and now Pervez Musharraf, continue their Pan-Islamist policy, and align themselves closely with Turkey, Azerbaijan and the Islamic world. Since the explosion of the first Pakistani nuclear bomb, Pakistan has become a menace to its neighboring states. Now Pakistani leaders are trying to project power to Russia's Islamic frontier, where Islam-dominated Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are becoming targets of radical Islamic intrusions. Pakistan was involved from the very first day of the formation of the Taliban and Al Qaeda movements until after the 9/11 events. After 9/11, President Musharraf was given two choices: Either join the U.S. to fight against terrorism, or risk being called a terrorist-sponsoring state. Musharraf had no choice but to side with America as an ally and, with an ironic twist of history, to become a front-line state in the fight against Islamic terrorism. Azerbaijani leaders were also in collaboration with global terrorists until 9/11. Since then, in a 180-degree turn, the leadership in Baku not only declared themselves a front-line state against international terrorism, but they also began to mislabel Karabagh Armenians as terrorists. They were also not given a choice; either they had to join the US or risk being called a terrorist-sponsoring state. Both Pakistani and Azerbaijani leaderships, by promising self-determination rights for the Muslim population in Jammu Kashmir while denying the same rights to Karabagh Armenians, revealed their double standards in international affairs and policies that are based on their Islamic beliefs and bias against non-Muslims. Their past collaboration with Islamic terrorism is evidence that their new role as front-line states to combat international terrorism is a farce. Both Washington and Moscow know this. They are convinced that Karabagh Armenians deserve better, to live in peace and prosperity with control of their own destiny based on self-determination. Pakistani and Azerbaijani leaders promise to liberate Karabagh from Armenians, showing their double standard, expansionist intent and biased primitive mentality.

"The Mother See here issued the following statement on last Sunday's bombing of Christian churches: The Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin learned with sorrow from the Armenian Diocese of Iraq of the terrorist events of August 1, which resulted in the loss of life and many injuries. Five churches were damaged, including an Armenian Catholic church. The Armenian Apostolic churches and the diocesan headquarters of Iraq were not attacked or damaged. The Armenian Apostolic Church expresses her sympathies to the families of the victims and all Iraqi people, and wishes complete recovery to the wounded and injured. We pray that the centuries of friendship and peaceful coexistence among Christian and Muslim peoples in the East will not be endangered by similar condemnable violence; for peace to be reestablished in the region; and that the Iraqi people continue with the creation of their safe and progressing lives.

"Attackers wreck five liquor stores along the same Baghdad street but, amid the rubble, a Christian and a Shiite Muslim say their friendship is stronger than the Islamist extremists' hatred of alcohol. Vartan Sarkissian, 51, an Iraqi Armenian whose family fled to Baghdad to escape the 1915 genocide under the Ottoman Empire, lives in a Christian neighborhood around Al-Thariba Avenue. The busy shopping street is also home to his Shiite friend, Salah Abdallah, despite being outnumbered nine to one by Christians. The 38-year-old car salesman has an apartment in a building near Vartan's shop, which sells mobile telephones. The pair, both sporting moustaches, are good friends. Their children play together. Every now and then, they even share a small glass of something alcoholic. And Salah, a moderate Muslim, is on occasion invited to the local church to attend family events. He has a figure of Jesus at the front of his car as a present from my Christian friends, Salah explained, adding that he really enjoyed Mel Gibson's blockbuster, The Passion of the Christ. The two friends were, naturally, shocked by the bomb attacks, which took place overnight Wednesday [July 21] against five liquor stores along their street. It reduced the shop fronts to rubble and also wrecked several neighboring stores. Vartan's mobile phone outlet was partially damaged. We do not want an extremist in a turban ruling Iraq. It is not possible to set up an Islamist regime here, said Salah, who blamed militiamen loyal to radical Shiite cleric Moqtada Sadr for the attack. Such men adhere to a strict line of Islam and frown on any association with alcohol. Moqtada has divided the Shiites, who represent around 60 percent of the Iraqi population, said Salah. But these attacks are not going to affect out relationship with the Christians. They are our brothers and are always welcome here, he said. Despite the strong sentiment, the violence does have an adverse effect. Vartan can name five or six families who have recently left the country for Syria or fled to Iraqi Kurdistan in the north. It is sad because they are people we have welcomed for 20 years, agreed Salah. His Christian friend appeared set to weather the storm, however. I will repair my shop and pray for those people who have lost their sense of social responsibility, Vartan said. Vartan does not blame Iraqi Muslims for the violence that has raged in the country for the past 15 months. It is simply a case of establishing what their goals are, to find who is pushing from behind: it is Iran, he said. Salah and Vartan said they were prepared to begin communal patrols, armed with Kalashnikov riffles, to help secure the neighborhood. I will protect him and he will protect me. We are not just neighbors, we are friends and brothers, said Vartan. He is like an uncle to my son. There are people who want to break the bonds in Iraq between Christians and Muslims. They will not succeed, said the Armenian. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2004-08-07,1
"The Parts, by Keith Ridgway, Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press, ISBN 0 312 32769 2, 457 pages, $24.95) Novelist Keith Ridgway's literary star is rising, and his new novel, The Parts, sends his star even higher Born in Dublin, Ridgway turned reviewers' heads with his edgy first novel The Long Falling, which won acclaim as a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. The promise that illuminated that novel gleams ever brighter in the tension, biting wit, and pathos that fuel the surely wrought prose of The Parts. Set in today's Dublin, Ridgway's plot and characters teem with the life that only an insider, someone who knows the old and the new of a place, the changes in culture, can truly capture. Ridgway knows Dublin and its denizens. The novel weaves a tale of six intertwined lives, with each rendered in the voice of the character, the six voices reflecting the new openness in Irish society. When Joe Kavanaugh, a late-night radio DJ, opts to take a new tack with his show, he asks his producer, Barry, to round up young people off Dublin's streets and bring them into the studio so that Joe can interview them. On one of his forays, Barry encounters Kez, who intrigues him not just as an interview, but also as a person. Meanwhile, a wealthy widow named Delly Roche hears Kitty Flood read from her novel in a bar one night, and Delly, enthralled by the writer, cultivates a friendship with her. Delly's waning health leads Kitty to become her caregiver and Delly to become the writer's patroness; Kitty soon receives the earnest support of Delly's adopted son, George, an American doctor. What Ridgway does in The Parts with these six characters is no easy novelistic feat. He connects them in myriad ways that keep the reader as mesmerized by the unfolding story as Barry is by Kez. As Barry and Joe are suckerefd into the conspiracy theories of one of their regular callers, the lives of all six people twist ever tighter around each other, especially after George discovers a legacy that Delly's husband, who had been a pharmaceutical mogul, left. A gnarled set of decades-old secrets soon materializes with profound effects for the characters. Readers will learn whether only death can assuage Delly's past infidelity, whether the obese romance novelist Kitty is a true friend or an opportunist, whether Dr. George Addison-Blake is crazy or just seems so whether Barry's unspoken love for Kez might have explosive consequences, and whether Joe Kavanagh's midlife crisis will ruin him. Again, in Ridgway's gifted, nuanced, tough, and often bitterly brilliant prose, all of this not only works, but soars. His description of Dublin early in the book is not the stuff of travelogues, but of someone who knows all that is grand and all that is ghastly about his native city: There is a Dublin of the rich of course, and a Dublin of the poor. That's standard stuff. But there's more than that. The rich like a little multiplicity after all; the poor are wealthy in variation. And then there's the neither rich nor poor - the getting by, the middle mass, the bulk. Where do they live? They live in Dublin with the others. A million kittens in a sack, down by the river. Working Dublin, queer Dublin, junkie Dublin, media Dublin, party Dublin executive, homeless Dublin, suburban Dublin, teenage Dublin, gangland Dublin, Dublin with the flags out, mother Dublin, culchie Dublin, Muslim Dublin, the wind ripped rain at eleven o'clock in the morning on Pears Street in February Dublin, drunken Dublin, hungry Dublin, Dublin of the vice squad and the syphilis outbreak, dancing Dublin, pro-Cathedral Dublin, writer's Dublin, politician's Dublin, Dublin on the telly, Bono's Dublin, Ronnie Drew's Dublin, Bloomsday Dublin, the Dublin of Arbour Hill and Kilmainham Jail, Dublin, the Dublin, Gandon's Dublin, Duncan's Dublin. Teaching English as a foreign Language Dublin, Jewish Dublin, the emigrant's Dublin, the immigrant's Dublin, Dublin where they beat you up, railings Dublin, Dublin where they rob you, fanlight Dublin, Dublin where they rape you, gold club Dublin, Dublin where they kill you, the American Dublin, the St. Patrick's Day Dublin, the Phoenix Park Dublin, serial killer's Dublin, paradise, scary Dublin, money in brown envelopes Dublin, traffic jam Dublin, property Dublin, inept Dublin, the Dublin you can't afford, the Dublin that needs you, the Dublin that doesn't, Dublin with its view of the hills, Dublin with the sea in the bay and the river stumbling towards it, drunk. Dublin. For those who want their images of Ireland served up in a misty green haze where gentle brogues and kindly smiles greet one, Ridgway's take will go down more like raw poteen than a drop of Jameson's, but it is fascinating to let the novelist show you his Dublin. His description of a summer night in Dublin teems with life, energy, and the prospect of trouble: It's a big moon night. Bone dry. Warm. The great summer continues, unabated, and all the cities of Dublin lie back and bask in it, taking it in. The exit doors of the night clubs are thrown open onto lanes and back alleys and courtyards and side street, and shirtless boys and heat smudged girls are coming up for air, pressing against the damp bouncers and laughing, glancing sometimes at the skin colored hole in the pitch black sky. Certain bars are still serving, ceiling fans spinning, swaying like boats, watched fiercely close by certain worried drinkers, certain half hearted paranoid souls, fearing the worst, but ignored by most. Conversations are difficult. People are hazy now, or so sharp that they they're through you and out the other side. No one wants to talk. They want other stuff. With The Parts, Keith Ridgway proves again that he is an emerging, powerful, and unique voice in modern Irish fiction.

"BROOKLYN, NY -- Rev. Nicholas DiMarzio, Bishop of Brooklyn and Queens, led a community hearing on the civil rights abuses and other problems plaguing immigrant communities since 9/11. At the event, diverse group of immigrants and community leaders from Brooklyn and Queens presented testimony on the impact of these controversial government policies on their families and communities. Through personal testimony and policy recommendations, speakers focused on some of the most egregious civil rights violations and the unfair treatment of immigrants post-9/11 such as mass detention and deportations of Arab, Muslim and South Asian immigrants and the disturbing increase in local police authority to arrest undocumented immigrants. Part of the hearing also described the broader impact on immigrant communities, which range from denial of Driver's Licenses to undocumented immigrants, spiraling immigration applications backlogs and the creation of an environment of fear and hate. While the speakers voiced strong concern, frustration and fear, they also expressed hope that the Bishop's commitment to advocate on behalf of immigrant communities indicated a new opportunity to improve their lives. I am appreciative of the efforts made by all those who came to today's hearing -- those who came to share their personal experiences, those who came to report on the difficulties faced by the communities they serve, as well as those who joined me in receiving this important testimony. This hearing is a testament to the diversity and energy of Brooklyn and Queens and is an excellent example of people working together as one community to overcome the hardships and obstacles that individually seem insurmountable, said Bishop DiMarzio. I look forward to working with beating participants in the future to preserve the rights of our immigrant friends, family, neighbors and parishioners and hope that the government officials we approach regarding these concerns are responsive to the Diocese' commitment to protecting the dignity and safety of immigrant communities, Bishop DiMarzio concluded. We are excited to have Bishop DiMarzio's leadership in advocating on behalf of immigrant communities, Having an ally of the Bishop's stature, as a prominent member of the Roman Catholic Church with a record of commitment to assisting newcomers, is invaluable to our advocacy efforts in these troubled times, said Margie McHugh, Executive Director of the New York Immigration Coalition. Immigrant New Yorkers are facing adversity from all sides. Thousands of families are being torn apart by measures targeting immigrants based on their religion and nationality; entire communities are being driven underground by increased immigration enforcement and are afraid to report crimes, discrimination and bias attacks to the police; others are afraid to seek essential services like medical care. We urgently need other prominent New Yorkers to join the Bishop in this effort, McHugh added. Profiles of some of the speakers who gave personal testimonies on how they and their families have been affected by the issues addressed at the hearing are summarized below: Special Registration: Arif Mahmoud and his wife are both from Pakistan. She came to the united States as a lawful permanent resident with her family in 1999. Arif came to the United States in 2000. Uzma and Arif fell in love and married shortly thereafter. They have a daughter and are expecting another child. Uzma filed a petition for her husband to obtain permanent status, but because she is a lawful permanent resident, the application could take several years to be processed. Uzma has applied to become a U.S. citizen, and her naturalization petition is pending. If her petition can be fast-tracked, her husband's application can be processed immediately. After 9/11, everything has changed, says Uzma. We have made America our home with our children. I don't want my husband to be there [in Pakistan] and me and my children to stay here without their father. I need him here to help me raise them Arif Mahmoud and his wife are being assisted by the Council of Pakistan Organization. Special Registration: Sultana's husband is a victim of Special Registration and faces deportation as early as this fail if the immigration court does not grant their family political asylum, If he is deported, Sultana will eventually have return to Bangladesh with her 2 small daughters, who are both US. citizens. But the family does not even have the money to afford the plane tickets. Her older daughter, who is 8, is an honor student, and both girls are enrolled in schools here, The family has lived in Brooklyn for over 6 years and is a well-loved member of their community, Sultana must support her husband financially as he fights being deported and separated from them. Her husband has suffered emotional distress from his situation and Sulatana acts as the primary advocate for the family. She has to spend day after day going from lawyer to lawyer and paying them thousands of dollars in the hope of maintaining the life they have made here in the United States. Sultana is now an active member of DRUM and works with other families facing deportation, supporting them and advocating for change. Local Law Enforcement: Libia lost her job alter September 11th, 2001, and has since worked as a street vendor. Everyday she is afraid that the she will be arrested and deported. Working as a vendor is dangerous because the police have the authority to turn vendors over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, She says that the police take pictures of vendors, then later arrest them and send them to Immigration where they face deportation. Libia does not understand why the local police is coming after honest immigrants who want to work and pay taxes and treating them like criminals or terrorists. When she leaves the house each day, she does not know whether she will be corning back, but continues to work as a vendor because there are no other jobs available and she has to save money for her daughter's education. The Latin American Workers' Law Project is assisting Libia. Immigration Backlogs: Belkis Morales-Bermeo married her husband, at the time a legal permanent resident, in 1996. He filed a petition for Ms. Morales-Bermeo and her children from a previous marriage to receive their green cards In early 1997. However, in the seven years that have passed since the filing, they have not received any news on the status of the application. Since 9/li, her husband has become an American Citizen, the family has reapplied for their green cards and her two sons have graduated from high school, yet they are still waiting for their interviews. Because of the long delays in immigration processing she and her sons cannot take advantage of government programs allowing them to atten college. The lives on Ms. Morales-Bermeo and her children have been on hold for years, with no relief in sight. The Latin American Integration Center is helping Ms. Morales-Bermeo. Driver's License: Lorenzo Villablanca immigrated from Uruguay to the United States to seek a better life for him and his two children, but his inability to get a driver's license threatens all that. Since moving to New York City in 2000, Mr. Villablanca has made a living installing satellite dishes around the city. However, this is a job that requires him to have a driver's license to drive from his home in Brooklyn to clients' houses throughout the City. In addition, Mr. Villablanca needs to pay for his own car insurance to be able to keep his job, something he can't do without a driver's license. Yet, perhaps the biggest problem is the potential harm to his children's education. His children, ages S and 17, cannot get to school unless their father is able to drive them there. Hate Crimes: Gurdayal Singh knows well the dangers of being an immigrant to this country. Mr. Singh, a resident of Queens and naturalized United States Citizen, is a devout Sikh and chairman of the Shri Gum Ravidass temple in Woodside. On a bus ride to New York, Mr. Singh was verbally and physically assaulted by another passenger because of his Sikh turban. The bus driver, rather than helping to protect Mr. Singh, asked him and the assailant to both get off the bus in the middle of nowhere. It was only with the support of an African-American passenger that he was not removed from the bus. I know what you've been going through. We've been though this before. History repeats itself; she told him. Of course, none of this is new to Mr. Singh whose temple has been the target of numerous bias attacks. New Immigrant Community Empowerment is assisting Mr. Singh.

"THERE was a time when Everlast was everywhere. As lead singer with Irish American hip-hop act House of Pain, he took rap and hip-hop to the Irish suburbs and smashed perceptions of what a white rap act could achieve. Along with the Beastie Boys, House of Pain redefined hip-hop and opened the way for Eminem to take over the world. Jump Around, their best-known hit, became an instant classic, still played in black hip-hop clubs and Irish bars alike. House of Pain, a nickname for Ireland taken from an Austin Clarke poem, became a badge of honor for Irish American teenagers who wanted to express their Irishness but could never relate to their parents' ballad collection. Shamrocks and Shenanigans, Fine Malt Lyrics - House of Pain album titles played with Irish American stereotypes in a way that had never been tried before. Nowadays, Everlast has dropped much of his hip-hop personae. He has converted to Islam and found a new meaning to life after a life threatening heart valve defect. He is back with a new album of guitar-heavy soul and rock, a progression from his critically acclaimed platinum selling album Whitey Ford Signs the Blues. The new album White Trash Beautiful, has had mixed reviews, mostly favorable, but he is determined never to read any of them. If I believe the good ones, then I have to believe the bad ones, he said during an interview with the Irish Voice. I trip on my own music, not on the opinions of some moron who wishes he could do what I do. These guys don't know s*** about nothin'. I was always told that you have to worry when they all start liking your records. His public spat with Eminem, in which the rapper mocked Everlast's health, has been retold in the press many, many times, and the subject now bores him. It's dead between us. The whole world knew, so it didn't hurt me. It was like, 'Alight, let's just put this to bed. There is no beef here.' It's f***ing sad that people keep going on about that. All the press want is some f***ing beef between people, that's all they are interested in. The new album is mournful, but also a celebration of lower class living. The name White Trash Beautiful came after reading a biography of fellow Muslim Muhammad Ali. I found the title funny, he said. I read a lot about Muhammad Ali and the slogan 'Black Is Beautiful.' I thought it would be tongue-in-cheek to call the album White Trash Beautiful. It was an oxymoron. The white trash look has now been adopted by the rich people, so it seemed to fit. Despite his departure from House of Pain among a myriad of business problems, the band member are still friends, even if he feels nothing for his former record company. We (the band) talk whenever I am in town, we are all still friends. As for the record company, they are out of business now, so I don't really give a f*** about them. All record companies are just loan sharks when you break it down. The band, he says, were sympathetic when he told them that he had converted to Islam. The conversion came just before the band broke up. I was living with a Muslim family and it took eight years of learning. It was right before the break with House of Pain in 1986 that I started telling people this is what I do now. It doesn't mean I'm not a sinner, it's just a process to be a better person. Part of his enlightenment was a rejection of unnecessary violence which, he said, has said him to withdraw from comment about events in Northern Ireland. I haven't spoken to any of the cats I knew. I haven't been around Ireland. I don't support any kind of terrorism and I think that violence should be a very last resort but I still believe in the principles of what those people are fighting for. I never tried to be too active because I'm American and I don't live in the midst of where s*** is all f***ed up. All the trouble in the world, he says, has made him appreciate peacemakers much more. The world is so f***ed up right now, people just need to agree that there's no need for the violence and get on. That's the one big lesson I've learned. All I'm trying to do with my life right now it just get by.

"Armenian EyeCare Project (AECP) physicians provided free laser treatment and eye surgery to socially vulnerable Nagorno-Karabagh residents during the organization's 24th medical mission to Armenia. Led by AECP President Roger Ohanesian, the team of leading U.S. ophthalmologists and their Armenian colleagues treated more than 150 people and screened more than 3,000 residents in the Mobile Eye Hospital (MEH). In war-weary Nagorno Karabagh, the AECP doctors saw firsthand the high number of injuries from landmines and other explosives, especially among children. In many cases, the injuries caused blindness in both eyes. The sheer pathos that these injuries create cannot be overstated. Scores of children who have been blinded and have lost fingers, legs and hands are seen all over Stepanakert, explained Dr. Ohanesian. We had the good fortune to save the sight of one of these children by removing a piece of shrapnel and restoring her vision to near normal. Although her brother died in the blast, at least we were able to reduce the family's pain by this operation. Dr. Ohanesian added, I will never forget the smile from the child and her mother. It sustains me and makes all of our efforts worthwhile. The efforts of the Armenian EyeCare Project, a U.S. non-profit organization, are dedicated to the elimination of preventable blindness in Armenia (www.eyecareproject.com). The AECP was established in 1992 to provide medical training and treatment on a semi-annual surgical mission basis. One decade later, the organization made its presence permanent in Yerevan. On May 20-30, AECP physicians traveled to four Nagorno-Karabagh cities: Stepanakert, Hadrut, Martuni and Mardakert. The doctors traveled at their own expense and contributed their medical services. In addition, they worked closely with their Armenian colleagues and helped them learn and apply Western medical techniques. I have learned a lot on the MEH and I am glad that now I am able to share my experience with my colleagues in Karabagh, said Dr. Asatur Hovsepyan. For them, this is a true opportunity to be part of the MEH team and also to learn from our American colleagues. Dr. Sofia Kasyan agreed. Our doctors have had good quality medical education; however, there is always a need in upgrading skills and further training, particularly in terms of new methods and equipment. It was exciting to work with our American colleagues on the MEH as a team. The team changed the lives of many Nagorno-Karabagh residents for the better. My daughter is a widow, she lost her husband in the war, and we can hardly make ends meet. I used to work in a health post, but now I cannot do injections, explained Lilit Gasparyan, a nurse. After my cataract surgery I will be able to see the syringe and I will be able to work again and earn some money. Eugenia Ghazaryan, another patient, also appreciated the AECP physicians' efforts. Doctors came to us to bring help. People have no money, they cannot take care of their health. Life is difficult here. I invite the doctors to my place as my dearest guests! I am so glad they came to these people. In addition to Dr. Ohanesian, the medical mission's U.S. team consisted of Dr, John Griffin, Clinical Professor, Upstate Medical Center, Syracuse, New York; Dr. John Hovanesian, Clinical Instructor, Jules Stein Eye Institute, UCLA; and Dr. Richard Hill, Professor of Ophthalmology, University of California Medical Center, Irvine. They were joined by Lonnie Duka, a Laguna Beach, Calif.-based professional photographer, and Basilio Kalpakian, an ophthalmologist from Huntington Beach, CA. On this trip, we had the benefit of a surgeon trained in reconstructive and plastic surgery. Since there were so many children and adults who have had severe injuries that involved poorly closing lids and damaged eyes, Dr. Kalpakian was put to immediate work. He taught several of the Armenians his techniques and performed many unique procedures himself, explained Dr. Ohanesian. Dr. Kalpakian, who described the medical mission as a great honor to help our motherland, praised the Armenian physicians. The professionalism exhibited by the physicians at the Malayan Institute is very impressive. These Armenian physicians work untiringly and uncomplainingly under difficult environments to see and take care of the patients as best as possible. Dr. Kalpakian added, The visit to Nagorno Karabagh to take care of patients with the Armenian physicians at the mobile center was very touching as we saw patients who were very poor without any hope of getting care otherwise. Like Dr. Kalpakian, Dr. Hill shared his medical knowledge with his Armenian colleagues. He instructed all the doctors in the glaucoma clinic and operated with Dr. Lilit Voskanyan. The two worked together previously when she was an AECP Fellow at the University of California-Irvine in 1999. In Armenia you can do a lot of excellent things; you can train people who can then train other people, explained Dr. Hill, who joined the AECP for his 18th trip to Armenia. A good example is Professor Voskanyan. She is fully trained in glaucoma and provides Western-style glaucoma surgeries in Yerevan and, on occasions such as this one, comes here to Karabagh. Dr. Ohanesian praised Dr. Hill's long-term commitment. Rick, like John Griffin and Lonnie Duka, has no Armenian connections or ancestry. He comes to help out the country and has changed the fate of glaucoma patients forever. Dr. Hill helped facilitate the International Board of Ophthalmology; it recently tested a large number of Yerevan-based ophthalmologists. Those who pass the exam will be certified as Diplomats of the International Board. This will go a long way toward our goal of making Armenia a 'Center of Excellence' for ophthalmology, explained Dr. Ohanesian. Rick is also spearheading the educational department of the hospital which will provide an ongoing stream of 'Western' ophthalmic literature by Internet to the Yerevan-based library. Dr. Ohanesian added, Words cannot describe Rick's dedication to Armenia. Dr. John Hovanesian, also a frequent traveler to Armenia, arrived one week after the U.S. team so that he could bring all the items that AECP physicians found were needed. In addition, he was able to secure multiple corneas for transplantation, which he then used on the neediest patients. While we are still trying to raise funds and train people for the Eye Bank, it is necessary to bring corneas from America to use in Armenia, Dr Ohanesian explained. In the operating room, John trained Dr. Anna Hovakimyan who will later this year travel to the U.S. to complete an AECP Fellowship in Cornea at Cincinnati with Dr. Edward Holland. Dr. Hovanesian, a corneal specialist and active AECP Board member, said, Every time I come to Armenia, I see that the situation is getting better, the doctors are upgrading skills. This time too, we had very difficult and challenging cases as surgeons. Dr. Anna Hovakimyan did a very good job. Like Dr. Hovanesian, Dr. Griffin said he, has an enormous, positive impression of the Armenian doctors' skills. We see our Armenian colleagues handle cases that we do not normally see back in America, such as war injuries or hyper mature cataracts. Dr. Griffin 'is a very well regarded, busy ophthalmic surgeon from Syracuse, New York, who again took time from his many duties to join us for another round of extremely difficult diagnostic and surgical challenges, Dr. Ohanesian said. In addition to offering his considerable talents, John has donated thousands of dollars of new equipment to the AECP in Armenia. On this trip, Dr. Griffin also brought his daughter, Mary. I had such an amazing experience; everyone is so friendly in Armenia. It was exciting to be part of such a wonderful thing, said Mary, who definitely plans to return to Armenia. Dr. Ohanesian described Mary's contributions: She was a terrific team player and helped our volunteer photographer, Lonnie Duka, who was extremely busy in all the clinics of Yerevan and who chronicled the trip to Karabagh. Duka, a professional photographer for major companies in the U.S. and abroad, had no hesitation about volunteering his time. He took part in all our efforts, yet was able to be invisible as he registered the human emotion and pathos around him. All of us, including the Armenian doctors, enjoyed his upbeat sense of humor and his willingness to join in all of our activities, Dr. Ohanesian explained. As a Muslim of Albanian heritage, Lonnie helped further the integration of interfaith causes. Duka's principal inspiration for joining the medical mission was Dr. Ohanesian's unfailing commitment to the cause. Roger's personal dedication to Armenia and its people, as well as the highly sophisticated equipment and talent he and his team have contributed year after year, have been nothing short of outstanding, Duka explained. My role as the photographer was to reflect his caliber of quality care and professionalism in the digital image and ultimately communicate the miracles that can - and do - take place when purpose and compassion work in harmony. Benjamin Grigoryan, an AECP patient in his '70s, exemplifies the harmonic convergence. It is so good the American doctors came to Karabagh! People here will share the last piece of bread with you. Life was so hard during war, but we will never give up, even if there is no bread to eat, we would eat grass but never surrender. I wish to see Karabagh living in peace and prosperity and to see smiles on everyone's faces. He added, I work day and night, keep cattle, and all my four grandchildren graduated from universities. Whoever works will live. We are potentially rich, we should be OK. Money can always be made, what we really need is health for us and peace on this land.

"French President Jacques Chirac has strongly criticized George W. Bush for interfering in the EU's relations with Turkey. During a NATO summit in Istanbul, Mr. Chirac rebuked the US President for his comments earlier this week, when he said that Turkey should start EU talks late this year. He has nothing to say on this subject. It is as if I were to tell the United States how it should conduct its relations with Mexico, Mr. Chirac said. If President Bush really said that in the way that I read, then not only did he go too far, but he went into territory that isn't his, he continued. The EU will decide later this year if Turkey has met the conditions for EU membership. External Relations Commission Chris Patten earlier played down Mr. Bush's comments, acknowledging Washington's legitimate interest in seeing democracy in a Muslim state consolidated. At the recent EU-US summit, Mr. Patten said he would be surprised if a US President, whose next stop is Turkey, did not make such comments. But, for France, the issue is a sensitive one. Aside from general mistrust between the France and the US, Paris holds some deep reservations about Turkish entry into the EU. Turkey will be among the EU's largest members if it enters, shattering the current balance of power in the EU, which sees France and Germany taking a lead role. And it is not the first time Washington has been judged to have overstepped the mark. In autumn 2002, the US ruffled feathers by taking part in an aggressive campaign for Turkey to get potential member status, which it later received. That campaign led to Turkey being heavily chastised by the EU, and an agreement between Brussels and Ankara that there would be no repeat of the campaigning seen in the run up to the Copenhagen summit in 2002. This winter Turkey is widely expected to receive the go ahead to start accession talks. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.",NA,Armenian Reporter International,2004-07-10,1
"Last Sunday afternoon, June 27, 2004, President George W. Bush of the United States of America had a meeting with the religious leaders of Turkey. His Beatitude Mesrob II, Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul and All Turkey, accompanied by the Revd. Fr. Drtad Uzunyan, attended the meeting held at the Hilton Hotel in Istanbul at the U.S. Embassy's invitation. Also present was Orthodox (Ecumenical) Patriarch of Istanbul; Colin Powell, U.S. Secretary of State; Eric Edelman, U.S. Ambassador to Ankara; Dr. Condoleezza Rice, the President's National Security Advisor, and others. The meeting was cordial and began with President Bush welcoming each guest personally. The President, in his opening remarks, spoke of his appreciation of Turkey's being a mosaic of faiths and cultures, and how she presents a good model for a country that is a secular democracy, though predominantly Muslim. In his exchange with the Armenian Patriarch, the President indicated his awareness that His Beatitude had studied in the United States. In response, Patriarch Mesrob said that he considers the United States his second home after Istanbul, and therefore the visit of the President of the U.S. gave him great pleasure. The Patriarch also referred to America's hospitality over the years since the second half of the 19th century to hundreds of thousands of Armenians, who had settled on the friendly shores of the New World. The President fondly said that he thinks highly of the American-Armenian community and made a special reference to Mr. George Deukmejian, the 35th Governor of California. Speaking of the minority situation in Turkey, Patriarch Mesrob said that any of the non-Muslim minorities in Turkey, or, for that matter, for any ethnic or national minority to exist anywhere, three types of institutions are essential: First, places of worship to preserve religious heritage and to nourish the spiritual life of the community; secondly, schools to teach language and culture, and thirdly, foundations to fund religious and educational activities and the personnel who enliven them. The minorities in Turkey are attempting to maintain those institutions for the future and well-being of their communities. Patriarch Mesrob expressed his satisfaction that there was an ongoing Inter-faith dialogue between the different religious establishments in Turkey, and also a neighborly dialogue of life among peoples of various confessional communities. Another subject Patriarch Mesrob touched on was the intermediary roles of the minorities. He said that the communities have sometimes been in the past, are ready today and will be so in the future to act as catalysts in any peace undertaking in the region between Turkey and neighboring countries. And, finally, the Patriarch said that being ministers of religion engaged in spiritual edification, religious leaders try not to interfere or engage in politics. However, certain occurrences call for, if not political involvement, at least a moral response. Fully supporting the initiative of the World Council of Churches called the Decade to Overcome Violence, Patriarch Mesrob voiced the sadness and disquiet of many believers of various faiths in Turkey who are bombarded daily with terrible scenes of violence via the media. Such images come daily from Palestine, the Sudan, Afghanistan and Iraq and other places in the world. The Patriarch said he was deeply concerned with this because he is worried that such occurrences may cause lasting differences between various faiths and cultures. President Bush thanked the Patriarch for his remarks, but on the issue of violent images from Iraq, he emphatically iterated that he himself felt sick by certain images from the prison in Baghdad. That is not America or Americans. That is not us. Believe me, our feelings are mutual on this matter. We will deal with those responsible under the rule of law. Those kinds of actions are not permissible, because we are in Iraq for peace. We mean peace. Other subjects touched on during the meeting of the President of the United States with the religious leaders in Turkey were the following: the hoped-for accommodation of the Turkish government to institutions of higher learning that would train clergy for non-Muslim religions; the role of religion in peace efforts in the region; that religions are essentially peaceful and that they should be taught properly and not subjected to politicization; the accession of Turkey to EU membership fully supported by the religious communities in Turkey and their appreciation of the U.S. President's encouragement of that process. Patriarch Mesrob presented the President with an album of the Armenian churches in Turkey. The President gave the Patriarch a Steuben crystal bowl with his insignia engraved on it. The meeting ended with an opportunity given to the Turkish and international press to photograph the company. Patriarch Mesrob, before taking leave of the President, handed him a letter, which said: Dear Mr. President, It is with great pleasure that we welcome your visit to our country on the occasion of the NATO summit here in Istanbul. The Armenians of Turkey, constituting by far the largest Christian community in this country, have long cherished, with affection and amity, the United States of America, which, besides having a historic friendship and alliance with Turkey, also has welcomed to its shores many of our kinsmen since the second half of the 19th century. It is because of these warm sentiments that I feel able to express the uneasiness we feel at the escalating level of violence which has been spreading across the globe and which is especially pressing in the Middle East region, where we also live. I personally believe that you, Mr. Bush, as the president of a great country that leads the world, have the authority to affect the course of events, and this is why I would like to voice my anxiety to you. War, terror, torture, embargo, marginalization, defamation or condescension... Whatever form violence takes, it always leads to consequences which are not in accord with human dignity. Instead, it leaves indelible scars in memories and generates lasting enmities between peoples. Throughout history, there has never been an act of violence or retaliation which has not harmed the innocent. Sadly, the consequence is usually that violence begets more violence. This is why, even when seeking to serve legitimate, higher ideals such as establishing peace, upholding democracy or preventing terror, the resort to violence merely culminates in more pain and suffering to the innocent, especially children. Throughout history, when governments have resorted to force when challenged by violence or even civil unrest, it often effectively became collective punishments of whole nations or peoples. What has happened recently in Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Sudan are clear examples. This cannot be a portrayal of sublime sentiments and, indeed, to many it is viewed as revenge, a sentiment which cannot coexist with civilization. I believe that the United States of America and her President have the ability to preserve the values they struggle for without resorting to violence in all its terrible diversity. It is sufficient to maintain their trust in God, in their sense of vocation and ultimate potential for good. Whenever we embrace violence, we are already diminished and the high moral and religious ideals to which we aspire are betrayed. Mr. President, I can imagine to a certain extent the pressures that you must be undergoing at present and therefore please be assured of my prayerful support. May God be in all visions for world peace and may He protect us all from losing our faith. With my sincere good wishes, Mesrob II Armenian Patriarch of Istanbul & All Turkey.

"Q: Vahe was orphaned in Turkey and moved to Beirut. How did Vahe develop? Is he based on anyone? Your grandparents, both refugees as well, met and married in Lebanon and raised your mother in Beirut. Were your grandparents a huge influence on Vahe and the setting? A: Vahe developed slowly, over the years, as the novel itself developed. The character of Vahe in the book is entirely fictional, but the name of the character is taken from the name of my second cousin who was murdered in 1986 in Beirut during the civil war. This is not my cousin's story or history, but it is a very small way, an homage to him: it is in his memory that I wrote THE DAYDREAMING BOY. He was murdered as part of series of confessionally inspired violent acts, part of the ethnic cleansing of Beirut and its division into two cities: East Beirut, which became the Christian quarter, and West Beirut, which became the Muslim quarter. This firm division was wholly artificial: the myriad groups and religious sects had been concentrations of certain groups in particular areas. My own family lived in what became West Beirut, where Vahe was killed in 1986. During the civil war, many such confessionally motivated murders took place in both the East and West of the city. I can't says that my grandparents were an overt influence on this novel. They have both been dead for many years, but of course my memories of Lebanon, of Beirut, and of out family there before the civil war broke out, did and does have an impact on me and on what I choose to write about. Q: You've said that, in order to represent these stories, you need to accept the rumors of history. Is this a difficult process? How did you go about representing the story of Vahe? A: I am interested in all of the histories, and not just 'official history.' I suppose I am quite suspicious of official history, and I know that what it leaves out, denies, and elides is often the history of the powerless, the disenfranchised, the unclaimed: the minority voices; the unpopular and the vulgar. When I was a girl growing up in Los Angeles, I remember watching those horrid Westerns where the Native Americans were generally depicted as violent and debased. In large part, that was the primary narrative I was familiar with about the indigenous peoples of these lands - we certainly, at the time, learned nothing in school about Pre-Colombian America, and very little (Pilgrims and Indians, and the first Thanksgiving) about native peoples after conquest. It was not until I was in the eighth grade, when a teacher who was herself part Cherokee assigned us a portion of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee - a history of the broken treaties and atrocities committed by the US government against native peoples - that I realized that official history is, often as not, replete with lies. And the omissions are enormous. At the very least, it is written by the victors. On a personal level, of course, I knew that official history was not to be trusted, because to this day official Turkish history denies that a genocide of the Armenians took place during the First World War. And I knew that was a lie, because my great-grandparents had been murdered, along with numerous other members of the extended family. And although as a child in the Los Angeles public schools I never thought to question why we studied the First World War with nary a mention of the genocide of the Armenians in Eastern Turkey, now I find that incredible, terrible. Can you even imagine the study of the Second World War without mention of the Holocaust? It's not possible. But mostly it is possible, and even probable, to silence or simply erase the histories of disempowered groups; mostly, that is what happens. But fortunately, small stories, rumors even, survive, thrive, and eventually might even make it into history books and books of literature. Q: Your research is evident in both books, and you've spoken of wanting to know more about the history of your ancestors. How do you go about this research? A: Researching this book was more complicated in some ways than the research I did for Three Apples Fell from Heaven. For one, while writing the first novel, I was able to read numerous survivor accounts written by Armenians detailing their experience during the genocide. And I was able to mine these memoirs for details of the place and time and the terrible experience during the genocide. And I was able to mine these memoirs for details of the place and time and the terrible experience of the war and of the massacres. But, in THE DAYDREAMING BOY, I was interested in what happens after war, in the years and decades to follow, because clearly the repercussions of war are long and pernicious. But almost every memoir I have read by genocide survivors, in fact perhaps all of them, does not address life after genocide, in exile. Perhaps this is in part because after the First World War, most Armenian war refugees were simply trying to survive, to feed themselves and their children. Later, when Armenian survivors wrote about the genocide, they focused on the events of 1915-1917, because by then there was already a need to prove that the genocide had occurred. Vahe is an orphan. He was part of one of the transports of children that were sent out of Turkey in 1922 when the last Armenians were finally and fully removed from their ancestral homelands. He is someone without family, unclanned, without history and unable, actually, to ever know his family history. I was interested in this situation: a man who lives in exile and can never know more than he does: an extreme example of a war survivor: a man adrift. But it is precisely this sort of person who would never write a book or a memoir! I found two texts written by Armenian orphans, which proved invaluable and the rest, well, was left to the imagination. Q: Seeking truth in your writing is so important, yet, the truth of genocide, as you've said, is beyond understanding. Is writing about this paradox frustrating or is there something therapeutic in it? A: It is not perhaps that the truth of genocide is beyond understanding; we are now very familiar with the facts of genocide. The twentieth century has made all of us, unfortunately, good pupils of war and mass killings. But I suppose what we don't understand, or what I fail to understand, no matter how much I try and wrap my mind around it, are the whys of it, the hows of it. Why do we commit such terrible atrocities? Why are we killers? How can we possibly (over and over again) find the appropriate narratives (generally racist and xenophobic) to justify such terrible and cruel acts to fellow men and women? Genocide generally requires participation by large numbers of the population. At the very least, it requires a cowardly acquiescence on the part of many, so people must be motivated to act, to accept that the members of the group that one is killing are debased human beings, or, in fact, not human beings at all, but animals. How does this happen? What I often wonder is, why are we so primed, so ready, and sometimes; eager, to believe these narratives about the vile, brutish Armenian, Jew, Gypsy, American Indian, Tutsi. African, African-American, Mayan, etcetera, etcetera? Q: You're working on the third novel in this series, which began with Three Apples Fell from Heaven. Did you first envision this as a three-part series? Do the three novels together tell one complete story? A: I thought, six years ago, that I would write the story of my grandmother, a survivor of the Armenian genocide. I hadn't planned a trilogy or to write long term about this topic, but I suppose I became obsessed and the stories took hold of me. After the first book, I knew that I wasn't 'finished.' Will it feel finished after the third? I don't know. But I imagine that it will be enough, or, at least, that I'll be exhausted. Q: What questions does THE DAYDREAMING BOY answer for you? What cracks does it fill in terms of what hasn't been said about the genocide? Is there a special significance to you that THE DAYDREAMING BOY will be published to coincide with the observances of the Armenian genocide on April 24? A: I don't know if novels answer questions, but the writing of the novel allowed me to explore, to inquire. What happened to the thousands of orphans after the genocide? How did they make a life for themselves? What would it mean to live without ever knowing your family and without having the possibility of such a knowledge? What is the story of the least historied, the children, the orphans, the masses of unnamed children that one sees in the black-and-white photographs from that era? These questions were on my mind when I began the second book and I'm not sure that THE DAYDREAMING BOY answers them or even addresses them, but inquiry drives my work: my desire to know better than I do, to understand, to see. In my family, we never commemorated the genocide on that day or on any other day. In great part, my mother wanted to forget the genocide and all of the horrific stories she was raised on. But even my mother, thousands of miles away from Turkey and from her family in Lebanon, couldn't help but pass on the stories to her daughters. So yes, I think it's good the book is being released on that date, in honor of remembering the dead. Q: Why don't more people in this country know about the campaign waged by the Ottoman Turkish government against the Armenian communities, in your opinion? A: A number of reasons, one of which is simply that the Turkish government has waged a campaign of denial and obfuscation of facts since the founding of the modern Republic of Turkey in 1923. This is quite incredible, given Turkey's own history: prior to the founding of the modern republic, there were war trials to prosecute some of the military and government officials who had planned and carried out the genocide. The second reason, in the West at least, and quite specifically in America, has to do with education and media responsibility. An unarmed, dispersed Armenian community, largely indigent, didn't have a lot of clout after World War I to make its case known to a greater public. Once the Western powers had abandoned the Armenian cause, despite promises made during the war, promises made, in particular, by President Wilson, the Armenians were out of luck. Americans used to know quite a bit about the 'Armenian Massacres,' as they were known then. One has only to consult the New York Times archives between 1915 and 1923 to see hundreds of articles about the Armenian Question and subsequent calamities and humanitarian relief efforts. But as we know, we Americans have short memories and even shorter attention spans. And this isn't helped by an irresponsible and often uncritical media. But, basically, the Armenian genocide has simply not been included in the history books in America. As I have said, when we study the First World War in this country, the massacres and deportations of the Armenians are not mentioned, or at least that was the case when I was a child. Q: What's the relationship between Beirut and Vahe? What does Vahe's wife represent? A: Beirut is the city where Vahe lives obviously, but it is also the only home he has ever known. And yet, he is not Arab, not from that place. And in Lebanon, in the Middle East, you cannot change your clan, your race. It was always clear to the Armenians that they were outsiders in Lebanon, just as the Palestinians were never fully accepted into Lebanese society. And yet, Lebanon did open its doors to the Armenians - in large part because the Armenians were Christians, and the ruling Christian elite in Lebanon wanted to boost the numbers of Christians in the state. So Lebanon was a haven for Armenians in many ways, a place where they were able to live safely and often to thrive. For this reason, I think, many Armenians feel a real love and loyalty toward Lebanon. As for his wife Juliana? I have no idea. Q: Could you talk a bit about writing about war? What issues does it raise, personally and generally? A: Elaine Scarry, a writer and academic, has something very interesting to say about writing war. She writes: While the central activity of war is injuring and the central goal of war is to out-injure the opponent, the fact of injuring tends to be absent from strategic and political depictions of war. In other words, the people and institutions responsible for making, analyzing and recording war explicitly leave off the suffering of war and the mourning that follows. I suppose I believe that art and culture must do this work, that literature must record, represent, inquire into the suffering caused by wars in a way that history, military or otherwise, simply does not. It's important - vital, really. Otherwise, all war writing is in some way war propaganda - a promotion of war and its supposed 'glories.' Recently, I read an interesting article by a columnist from the Boston Globe, James Carroll, who writes about the failure of the American imagination to grasp the real effects of war, how this in part stems from the fact that from the Civil War until September 11, no massive violence had been experienced in the continental United States. We wage war without knowing war, he says. Perhaps the American writer has an obligation to write war in a way that represents, investigates, elucidates, to the extent that it is possible, some of the effects and realities of war, and to do this in part to contradict the disingenuous war-movie lie that Hollywood produces over and over again: that war is heroic, ennobling, romantic. Perhaps this is more important than ever, given the bellicose pursuits of the current administration and the history of previous administrations' military escapades, invasions and coups d'etat around the world. At the very least, we need to understand and know better than we do the rule the US government has played in wars across the globe since the turn of the 19th century. Q: What kind of connections do you see between the current conflicts in Iraq and the Middle East and what happened to the Armenians? What kind of generational effects are there to such conflicts? A: There are no direct connections between what happened to the Armenians in 1915 and the current conflict in Iraq, but the entire situation in the Middle East, of course, was affected terribly by the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent colonization of the Middle East by the British and French. Today we are still embroiled in the fiasco that these two colonial powers, with the later added power of the United States, wrought. The Armenians, like the Kurds, were not allocated a nation [sic] by the British and French after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and both groups have suffered enormously. In particular, the Kurds in Turkey and Iraq have paid a terrible price in lives since the First World War. And memory is long in the Middle East, history lives. People remember their histories there, no matter what official discourse says. In my family, there have been two major wars creating two generations of refugees: first. World War I in Ottoman Turkey which led to the exodus to Lebanon, and second, the Civil War in Lebanon which led to the exodus to France and to the United States.

"The present Turkish leaders seem to be determined to secure Turkey's admittance to the European Union (EU). Most recently, the Turkish Parliament passed numerous amendments to reform the existing 1982 constitution, involving the penal code, the Turkish civil code, and laws pertaining to the press, freedom of belief and assembly, printing press, administration, police law, Turkish radio and television, higher education and others. According to Prime Minister T.R. Erdogan and Foreign Minister A. Gul, Turkey will spare no efforts to eliminate any potential shortcomings that may give pretext to the Europeans to reject Turkey's membership in the EU. As a goodwill gesture, the Turkish court set free four imprisoned Kurdish parliamentarians, including the most celebrated woman activist, Leyla Zana, who has been incarcerated for the past ten years for advocating cultural freedom for the Kurds. Also, TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) started to broadcast a brief Kurdish-language program. Turkish nationalists, led by Devlet Bahkcheli (Bagceli), is already attacking the Erdogan government for endangering the unity of the Turkish Republic and Turkish national security for the sake of joining the European Union. Meanwhile, the Kurds are testing Turkish tolerance and openly challenging Ankara to grant more extensive cultural, civil and political rights for Kurds in open meeting in the southern Turkish-Kurdish town of Diyarbekir during the welcoming ceremony of Leyla Zana and her former inmate political prisoner friends. EU MEMBERSHIP A BARGAINING CHIP FOR TURKEY While these astonishing events are evolving in Turkey, the Turkish prime minister, along with his Yemeni and Italian colleagues, was invited to the recent G8 summit on Sea Island off the coast of Georgia. The U.S. is determined to create a New Greater Middle East and needs Turkey. The Turks are scared of the awesome American military, economic and military power and its might to use it unhindered, so they are looking for membership in the powerful EU to gain a bargaining chip against Washington. The Turks are still demanding that the U.S. avoid granting federal status to the new Iraq and bar autonomy for the Iraqi Kurds. Meanwhile, with a few cosmetic changes in the constitution and penal code, the current government is allowing the implementation of these reforms and, thus far, is showing some tolerance for their Kurdish citizens' grievances in order to meet EU demands. The Law on Crimes against Ataturk, and The Law on Treason, which is the most open to interpretation, are still intact, and no one will ever dare to challenge them. Prime Minister Erdogan sent a memo to his party functionaries a long time ago not to cross the red line set by the mighty Turkish generals; namely, not to raise issues of regionalism, ethnicity and religious affiliation. by stating this, he is telling his party members to avoid regional populist politics in Kurdish regions, like asking for additional funding for economic development or educational improvement in the Kurdish-inhabited eastern and southeastern provinces since it may be considered to promote decentralization and separatism. In the same context, not to discuss the religious affiliation issue since the country's Sunni, Shiite and Alawie followers are divided along ethnic fault lines, and any unsettling influence on Turkish unity may trigger a response from the Turkish generals, who are committed to preserving Kemalist principles. It is a known fact that these Kemalist principles set forth by Ataturk and zealously maintained by the Turkish generals will continue to supersede any new constitutional amendments or penal code changes that the Erdogan government is trying to implement in order to accede to EU demands. MANY CHALLENGES FACING TURKEY The Turkish leaders are confronting many challenging issues at the same time, and are trying to deal simultaneously with U.S.-sponsored The Greater middle East project, ever unsettling the Iraqi quagmire in the south and de-facto autonomy status granted to Iraqi Kurds in northern Iraq, to meet the European Union demand to implement the newly enacted reforms in Turkey, to face domestic economic, social and political challenges, and how to deal with the resurrected Armenian Question. The Turkish government, state-sponsored TRT (Turkish Radio and Television) and Turkish Historical Society are collaborating in an effort to find ways to prevent the internationalization of the Armenian Question and to characterize Armenian accusations of genocide and demands for land and financial compensation as unjust and legally unfounded. Following the dissolution of the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission, the Turkish government is now attempting to arrange private meetings between various Armenian organizations and Turkish political functionaries. Thus far, they have succeeded in creating the impression that they are for dialogue but no positive results were obtained except the ICTJ report, which concluded that the 1915 events included all of the elements of the crime of genocide as defined by the UN Convention on Genocide. The ICTJ report was welcomed by Armenians and rejected by the Turks. The Turkish Historical Society and the so-called Armenian Research Institute in Ankara held an anti-Armenian propaganda conference on May 29-30, 2004, demonizing the Armenians. The Turkish government unleashed an unprecedented campaign to justify Turkish dealing with the Armenian question both in the past and present, and is blaming the Armenians for committing atrocities, genocide and terrorism against the Turkish and Azeri peoples. TRT'S DIALOGUE PROGRAM ONE WAY On June 12, 2004, TRT's Dialogue program interviewed Dr. Senol Kantarci from TUSAM (Turkiye Stratejik Arastirmalar Merkezi/Turkey's Strategic Research Center). This orchestrated interview was conducted to discourage any potential dissident historians and sociologists from following the path of Halil Berktay, Fikret Adanir and Taner Akcam, and indoctrinate Turkish youth and intelligentsia with a Kemalist view of history pioneered by one of the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide, the former Ittihadist and famous revisionist historian Esat Ahmet Uras. (It is noteworthy that Uras later served as interior minister in the Kemalist nationalist regime.) This lengthy interview on TRT was a repetition of the same familiar Turkish stance that the total Armenian population in Ottoman Empire did not exceed 1.2 million. The total number of Armenian deaths never exceeded 200,000 and it was the result of an intercommunal civil war, weather conditions, starvation and disease but there is no proof that it was premeditated, preplanned or executed by the Ottoman government. Turks claim that the Ottoman state even extended its protection to deportees. The Armenians revolted in order to establish a Greater Armenia on Turkish lands, collaborated with the invading enemy and committed atrocities against the Muslim populations in Anatolia and the Caucasus. TRT also claims that the no British wartime documents have been found to incriminate the Ottomans; rather, the Armenians provided forged documents during the Servres and Lausanne conferences, and all their lies were exposed. The Turks never committed any atrocities or genocide against any of their subjects and brought peace and justice to the populace under their rule (characteristic Turkish denial and amnesia). With unprecedented cynicism, Dr. Kantarci touched on the recent Canadian Parliament resolution recognizing the Armenian Genocide, and France's Socialist leaders' remark that Turkey's admittance to the EU is contingent on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide. He condemns the Americans, Europeans, Russians and Iranians for spoiling Armenians and using double standards. Dr. Kantarci claims that Armenians are the aggressors who committed numerous acts of terrorism against the Azerbaijani population, causing death and destruction in Azerbaijan. As a result, one million (600,000) Azeris became refugees in their own land, he said. He went on to say that Turkey was the first country that recognized Armenia's independence, yet Turkey couldn't establish diplomatic relations with Armenia due to justifiable reasons. Furthermore, Turkey didn't place any demands but just asked the Armenians not to do the following: 1) Don't tarnish the Turkish image in world public opinion by pursuing the unsubstantial genocide claims and stop financial compensation claims. 2) Erase the paragraph from the Armenian constitution that contains the phrase Western Armenia which means laying claim to Turkish territory and eliminate Agri Daghi (Mount Ararat) from the Armenian coat of arms since this mountain and mentioned territories lie in Turkey, as delineated by the Gumri, Moscow and Kars agreements. 3) As mandated by several UN resolutions, vacate the seven Armenian-occupied Azeri districts and accept Azeri sovereignty in Karabagh (equivalent to accepting Greek sovereignty over Cypriot Turks, rejected by Turkish leaders). In 2004, these are the important issues that are preoccupying the Turks. The basic fundamental issues, like adherence to human rights, respect for minority and religious rights, granting citizens the basic right to be able to use their native tongue, to preserve their culture and tradition, to implement laws to protect every citizen's rights without taking arbitrary punitive actions against those who have different views than the Turkish generals, should have been resolved a long time ago. Turkish leaders wasted 54 years since the experiment of democratization started in 1950; now they are being challenged by the Europeans to implement those amended penal code changes and constitutional reforms. TIME WILL TELL Time will tell if the EU will accept Turkey, and time will also tell if Turkey will accept the new realities developing near its borders, namely Kurdish autonomy in northern Iraq, Armenian sovereignty in Karabagh, Armenian Diasporan demands to accept responsibility for the Armenian Genocide, and unification of Cyprus. Time will also tell if Turkey will abandon its ambitions to advance its sphere of influence in the Balkans, in the Greater Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asian and will be able to give up the dream of Pan-Turkist and Pan-Turanist unity among Turkic-speaking people once the autocratic ruler in Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan are replaced with forces ready to cooperate with Ankara. One wonders if the former Foreign Minister of Armenia and Secretary of the HhSh Party/ANM (Armenian National Movement) Alexander Arzumanyan has the capacity to understand these issues when he stated that Armenia's present leadership made a fatal mistake in granting Russians military bases, thus preventing integration between Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. One may wonder what the rational is to reach such a conclusion. Article copyright The Armenian Reporter International.","Acemoglu, Murat",Armenian Reporter International,2004-06-19,1
"Leaders from the National Council of Churches held a prayer service on May 27, 2004, remembering the fallen heroes who have thus far died liberating Iraq. Taking part in the service was Bishop Vicken Aykazian, diocesan legate and ecumenical officer. The service, held at the National City Christian Church at Thomas Circle in Washington, DC, drew religious leaders together in remembrance of the sacrifice of the fallen soldiers from the United States, Great Britain, Spain, Italy, and dozens of other countries that have joined in fighting to liberate Iraq and promote democracy. The religious leaders also prayed for the international reporters, non-military personnel, and Iraqi civilians who died in the fighting. The service included songs, prayers, and readings from Hebrew, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Taoist traditions. Moments of silence allowed participants the chance to reflect on what commitments they were willing to make to work for peace. The theme of the prayer service, The Power and Promise of Peace, is part of the U.S. Conference of the World Council of Churches effort this year to further the global ecumenical Decade to Overcome Violence. Similar services were held the same day in 18 locations across the country. Participants in Washington spent a significant portion of the service on a call to repentance, during which families of U.S. soldiers and a representative of Iraqi civilians lit candles.

"THE leader of Gun Owners of America, a major lobbying group, has told the Irish Voice that peace would come to Northern Ireland much sooner if everybody had a gun. Larry Pratt recently visited Northern Ireland at the invitation of a Unionist group there. I would be interested in arming everyone (in Northern Ireland). Guns should be allowed throughout the United Kingdom and I think its immoral to tell someone they cannot protect themselves, he said. Pratt's alleged links with White Supremacy, a racist group, in 1996 saw him fired from his position as campaign manager during Pat Buchanan's run for president. The Northern Irish group that sponsored his visit, Families Acting for Innocent Relatives (FAIR), was formed in 1998 as a support group for the victims who felt themselves marginalized by the peace process. Pratt said the IRA were thugs, and thugs tended to work together. I don't think of the IRA as Catholic but as terrorist thugs, just like I don't see al-Qaeda as Muslim. Thugs tend to work together. If you have a gun you have a better chance of deterring most of the murders that happen in Northern Ireland, he said. For decades, Ulster has been scourged by the violent terrorism of the IRA. Ostensibly, the IRA seeks to unite all of Ireland under the government of the Republic of Ireland in the south. Truth be told, the IRA has the same love for the government of the Republic of Ireland that al-Qaeda has for the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Pratt says he was moved by a visit to the site where his host, Orangeman Willie Frazer's father, was shot. After 1972 when the British government became obsessed with disarming the citizenry, it refused to allow the Ulster Defense Force personnel to go home with guns. That is when the IRA killings increased sharply. Gun control has predictable, and negative, results, he explains. Pratt says there will be no solution or even peace in Northern Ireland until armed self-defense is allowed. In their manifesto, FAIR says the purpose of their organization is to expose the Republican movement. We intend to expose to the wider world that they are just serial killers for the Republican cause who believe they have a right to kill in the name of a united Ireland, they say. We believe the U.S. needs to awaken to the threat the IRA poses to America and the American way, they continue. Article copyright Irish Tribune.","Brennan, Georgina",Irish Voice,2004-06-02,1
"It is my obligation to convey the following: Turks accuse the Armenians of collaborating with their enemy, the Russians, and fighting against the Turks in the east of the Ottoman Empire. They say, Armenians stabbed us in the back, but they dismiss the fact that those Armenians, as Russian subjects, were doing what was their legitimate obligation. Armenians living in the west of the Empire during World War I were a docile lot, forced to mute submission. They gave the Turks whatever was demanded of them: their horses, carriages, livestock and all kinds of grains. The Turks disarmed and executed the Armenian soldiers who were assigned to building the vital Berlin/Baghdad railway line, despite objections from their German allies. And they categorically executed the rest of the Armenian soldiers. They drove the elderly, the inform, the women and male children under the age of ten into the Syrian desert of Deir Zor to die of exposure, thirst, starvation and disease. Yes, there were pockets of resistance. Who in his right frame of this mind will acquiesce and leave his home, his business and all his belongings to those who had suppressed the Armenians for generations? The Armenian Genocide has become a theatrical game of numbers. The 1.5 million was once reduced to 600,000 and then again to 300,000. And lately, they're saying not only there was no Genocide, but Armenians massacred the Turks. Armenians have an appropriate saying for that kind of quackery. Lezoon voskor chooni. The tongue has no bone. It can swing every which way. Turks say they suffered more casualties than Armenians, implying that Armenians killed 2 million Turks, equating their loses in the war. There were 2.2 million Armenians living in Turkey in 1915 and perhaps a million Greeks, 250,000 Christian Assyrians, thousands of Chaldeans and other Christian citizens. Why was the entire Armenian population of the Ottoman Empire condemned? Were there no innocent souls among them? Why are the Armenian churches being converted into mosques, warehouses, police stations, prisons and stables for animals? And why are Armenian cemeteries being obliterated? Great Britain and the United States have hesitated in using the world Genocide. Instead, they use evasive and jumbled words like tragedy and disaster because they're afraid that Turkey, a NATO member, might be slighted or embarrassed. Germany, the chief culprit, and ally of the Ottoman Empire in World War I, had exclusive knowledge of what happened in 1915 and throughout the war years. Shame on Germany for having not yet recognized the Armenian Genocide! Likewise, Great Britain and the United States are guilty. Newspaper stories between 1915 and 1918 in those countries and throughout the world are replete with stories regarding Christian Armenians and their suffering. Unlike France, who has come clean and was not afraid to use the word Genocide, the United States and Great Britain lack intestinal fortitude. Shame on them! Canada, which had flip-flopped on the recognition of the Armenian Genocide for the last 25 years, finally came through with 153 voices in favor and 68 against the recognition. Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Graham issued a statement saying, The government is not bound by the vote and its position has not changed. He also added, WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE WILL OF THE HOUSE, but the government's position remains the same. Bill Graham said, I am deeply concerned that (the recognition) could have negative consequences. He was thinking the vote might have an effect on several major contracts in Turkey. ANOTHER GENOCIDE LOOMING The so-called Fundamentalists of the southern United States, who claim to be Christians, are far from being genuine Christians. Since the start of the Cold War, the U.S. government granted Muslim Turkey billions of dollars and armed them to the teeth. Turkey is not interested in fighting Russia, the former Soviet Union, but she would look for a chance to destroy Armenia, its foremost enemy, and complete the elimination of Armenia, which Turkey could not completely do in 1915. Once Armenia is wiped out, Turkey will categorically sign a friendship with Russia, and the effort the U.S. government has invested in arming Turkey will be blown in the wind.

"The Armenian Research Institute (EREN/Ermeni Ararstirmalari Enstitisu) and ASAM (Eurasian Strategic Research Center/Avrasya Stratejik Arastirmalar Merkezi) held their Second International Conference in the Turkish capital of Ankara on May 29-30, 2004. It is somewhat puzzling as to why the organizers of this gathering presented it as an International Conference on Armenian Research Studies, since the only participants were Turks, Azerbaijanis and pro-Turkish foreign academics like Justin McCarthy, Stanford Shaw, Bernard Lewis and Andrew Mango were notably absent. The conference was chaired by rabid anti-Armenians, including Prof. Yusuf Halacoglu, Chairman of the Turkish Historical Society, Sukru Elekdag, Member of the Turkish Parliament and former Turkish ambassador in Washington, and Gunduz Aktan, former member of TARC and ASAM Chairman. ANTI-ARMENIAN CONFERENCE AGENDA The two-day conference was loaded with a broad agenda, mostly to refute and deny Armenian Genocide claims and to prove that Armenia never existed as a sovereign state. All the presenters, who were supposed to be experts on contemporary and past Armenian issues and history, engaged in sheer anti-Armenian propaganda. Their presentations were devoid of any academic value and were repetitious, claiming that Armenians were the ones who actually committed atrocities and genocide against innocent Turks and Azeris. The 30,000 Armenian deaths (Turkish version) were the direct result of intercommunal fights, environmental factors and disease. These Turkish and Azeri so-called academics categorically denied that there was any preplanned government decision to harm Armenians. They went on to state that deportation orders were given to control the Armenian uprising instigated by the Russians, which was jeopardizing the Ottoman Army's communication lines. Just recently, some optimistic Armenians were prematurely applauding TARC's so-called achievements during the past two years. However, this conference proves once again that the Turks are engaged in doubletalk. When talking to Armenian and American audiences, they express their wishes to establish a dialogue with Armenians; at the same time, they are taking the offensive and trying to convince international public opinion that they are innocent of any wrongdoing and that the real guilty party is the Armenians. To get an idea about the nature of this so-called International Conference on Armenian Research Studies, it is sufficient to glance at its agenda. Some of the topics discussed over these two days were the following: DISCUSSION TOPICS 1) The Azeri Genocide Perpetrated by Armenians in Baku in March 1918. 2) The Massacre of Azeris in Hodjali Perpetrated by Armenians and Their Russian Collaborators in 1992. 3) Armenian Deportations and Armenian False Genocide Claims. 4) The Assassination of Talat Pasha and Soghomon Tehlirian's Acquittal and the Muslim Response. 5) How Foreigners Instigated the Armenians Who Were Used to Conducting Anti-Turkish Activities. 6) The Armenian Propaganda Movie Ararat and the Distortion of History. 7) The Suffering of Turks in Eastern Anatolia at the Hands of Armenians. 8) Armenian Expansionism and the Idea of Greater Armenia. 9) Turkish Children and Their Assimilation by Armenians after the Conclusion of World War I (one should substitute the phrase Turkish children with Armenian children, to be more accurate - M.A.). 10) The Armenian Church and Its Role in Terrorism against the Turks. 11) The Ottoman Court-Martial and Unjust Punishment of Turkish Officials. 12) Behind the Curtain of Turkish-Russian Confrontation in Reference to the Azeri-Armenian Conflict. 13) Armenian Intention to Annex Nakhichevan and the Turkish Reaction. 14) Armenia 2020 Project and Its Future Implications. 15) Armenians and Their Leader Kocharian Must Have a Change of Mentality. 16) The Armenian Question and German Public Opinion. 17) Armenian Anti-Turkish Activities Extending from the Ottoman Territories to the Caucasus (Azerbaijan) and Central Asia (Turkistan) at the end of World War I. 18) Under the Ottomans, Armenians Were Privileged Citizens and They Prospered at the Expense of Turks and Muslims. 19) Forgotten Turkish Tragedy/Deportation of Turks from the Eastern Provinces (Armenian Districts). 20) Armenian-Latin Relations during the Crusades. 21) Armenian Terrorism Against Turkish Targets and Diplomats. The list goes on and on. As renowned Turkish columnist Cetin Altan once stated, Turks are making Turkish propaganda to their fellow Turks (Turkun Turke propaganda etmesi). As progressive Turkish historian Halil Berktay and journalist Murat Belge stated, the Turks are trying to convince themselves that the Armenian Genocide did not happen while the rest of the entire world continues to claim otherwise. SURPASSING ALL OTHER TURKISH DENIALISTS Anyone who follows government-sponsored Turkish academic and strategic studies publications, and government leaders' statements - from Mustafa Kemal Ataturk to Prime Minister Tayip Ragib Erdogan, from late President Ismet Inonu to President Necdet Sezer - and the panel discussions held by political scientists in Turkish State Television and Radio would not be surprised with the presentations mentioned above. Yet, former TARC member Gunduz Aktan and former Turkish Ambassador in Washington and now second man in the Turkish Republican Party, Sukru Elekdag, surpassed any other known Turkish denialists with their most recent amazing statements when they appealed to the conference participants to jointly request the German Court to reopen Soghomon Tehlirian's trial, to overturn his not-guilty verdict, indict him for Talat Pasha's murder, and declare Talat Pasha innocent of any wrong doing. After all, Talat, Enver, and Djemal Pashas were interned in three different mausoleums located in Turkey today, to immortalize their good services to the Ottoman empire (for murdering Armenians). They are commemorated as national heroes in the land where Armenian blood is considered to be cheap and fanatic Turkish nationalists have a tendency to consider Armenians the most vile, accursed, and hated persons. Once the proceedings of this so-called Second International Conference on Armenian Research Studies are published, one can be sure that they will create a lot of controversy. They will inflict a heavy blow to Armenian-Turkish reconciliation efforts and will discourage dialogue between the two nations. It is noteworthy that throughout the conference the main theme was After the recognition of the so-called Genocide, Armenians will certainly raise financial and territorial compensation issues. Speakers also articulated the common belief that the European Union will raise the Armenian issue in order to place manmade obstacles in the path of Turkey's quest for membership. IMPACT ON EU MEMBERSHIP The leaders of the European Union countries numerous times advised the Turks to sort out their historical problems with all their neighbors, including Armenia, since the EU believes that each member state should not have any conflicts or outstanding disputes with their neighbors if they intend to join the European Union. After the statements of Gunduz Aktan and Sukru Elekdag, one wonders if the Turks have the capacity to adapt and effectively integrate into the European value system. Calling Talat Pasha innocent is a blatant defiance of that value system. Could anyone in Germany today dare to proclaim Adolph Hitler a national hero innocent of any wrongdoing, and accuse his executioners, the Allied Coalition Forces, of criminal conduct, or erect a mausoleum to commemorate him? In compliance with the official Turkish government policy in reference to Armenian issues, Turkish academic are losing their academic integrity and standards because of their over-reliance on Turkish denialist historiography that was pioneered by the late Ahmet Esat Uras (one of the perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide) and his associates. One may hope that, after the Turkish translation of the eminent Genocide scholar Prof. Vahakn Dadrian's book, progressive and dissident Turkish historians will reeducate themselves and try to challenge the outdated official propagandistic views of the Turkish Historical Society and the so-called Armenian Research Institute, which, so far, remain distorted and full of cheap propaganda and deceit. Eurasian Strategic Research Center Chairman Gunduz Aktan's closing remarks at the conference summarize Turkish fears. He states, Given the terms of the Lausanne Treaty, it is impossible for the Armenian side to demand lands or financial compensation from Turkey. He continues, This treaty eliminated the land problem and it is legally impossible for them (Armenians) to claim either land or financial compensation for land. TURKISH DEMANDS VIS-À-VIS ARMENIA The U.S. and the EU are trying to convince Turkish leaders to open a border gate with Armenia and improve their relations. So far, Turks continue in their demands for Armenia 1) To renounce any territorial or financial claims. 2) To stop the Armenian Genocide claims. 3) To withdraw from all occupied Azeri territory. 4) Some fanatic Turks even dare to ask Armenians to accept unconditional Azerbaijani control of Karabagh. Against all odds, should Armenia comply, the next step would be to demand withdrawal of Russian bases from Armenia. Indeed, should Armenia for any reason give in to all these demands, it will most likely end up becoming a satellite-client country of Turkey. Those voices who are asking for the retrial and conviction of Soghomon Tehlirian and acquittal of Talat Pasha and restoration of his honor are, I believe, tired voices of mute despair. In fact, the whole conference appears to be a desperate attempt to stem the tide of the process of Armenian Genocide recognition not only outside but, though gradually and hesitantly, even inside Turkey. One should never underestimate the significance of the growing cleavage in Turkey today between the old guard elites, including those who are part of the ruling circles, and an evolving new civil society set to contest and eventually displace these desperados for the sake of a truly democratic, emancipated and modern Republic of Turkey.

"Regardless of one's view of the US-led Iraq war, Turkey's ongoing threats to cross its border with Iraq in force undermine everything. Turkey has ignored the Bush Administration's repeated warnings to desist, and continues to reject American regional objectives and needs. When Turkey's Foreign Minister and Prime Minister visit the US over the next two months, the Bush Administration and Congress must make it abundantly clear that Turkey has squandered whatever opportunity it once had to be part of an Iraqi solution. The delicate balance within Iraq today cannot withstand Turkish meddling. Turkey was given every opportunity to participate in the run-up to the Iraq war. Ankara aggressively negotiated terms for its involvement, to include up to $25 billion in US assistance and the right of its 20,000 troops to go as far as oilrich Kirkuk in what is now Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. On the assumption that Turkey would ultimately join the coalition, American planners deployed a substantial northern front force for a simultaneous north-south invasion of Iraq. Turkey's late rejection of the northern front option forced the Americanled coalition to fight with much of its forces and materiel wrongly positioned, resulting in additional casualties during a war that had to be quickly recalibrated without a northern route. The enormous repositioning costs to bolster what became the sole southern front option and the ongoing consequences of waging a one-front war continue to be felt throughout Iraq. The full cost of Turkey's actions is incalculable and enduring. In this context, Ankara's demand that the US and other members of the coalition, including Armenia, put their forces at additional risk to accommodate Turkish needs is unconscionable. Turkey has earned no role in the emerging federated Iraqi nation of Kurdish, Shiite and Sunni regions. The Armenians of Lebanon are saying much the same about Turkey's possible participation in the UN force now being amassed on the Lebanese-Israeli border. Lebanon's Armenian religious and political leaders have declared that Turkey must not be part of the UN contingent. They argue that Turkey's legacy costs of Ottoman occupation of Arab lands and the Armenian Genocide make that nation unfit to serve. The Lebanese Armenian leadership further asserts that Turkey's ongoing hostility towards Armenia and Nagorno Karabakh, along with its denial of the Armenian Genocide, underscores the valid argument for Turkey's exclusion. As the Bush Administration has declared for Iraq, the Armenians of Lebanon declare for Lebanon - that Turkish troops will undermine the mission. Deploying Turkish troops to either Iraq or Lebanon is part of a larger identity debate taking place within Turkey and internationally. Within Turkey, the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) encourages or tolerates increasingly anti-Western and anti-American rhetoric. In the span of a few years, Turkish public opinion has turned from overwhelming support for EU membership to near-majority opposition. Turkish opinion against the US is even more dramatic. According to the latest Pew Global Attitudes report, only one in eight Turks has a favorable opinion of the US, the lowest rating in the 15-country world survey. Just 3% of Turks approve of President Bush - the worst ranking of any world leader by any country. In the past five years, Turkish public support for the US war on terror has dropped by half, and the majority is now convinced that the effort is doomed to failure. The AKP is responsible for Turkey's international and domestic policies and actions. What their leaders say should matter to all concerned with Turkey's Western vs. Islamist trends, particularly President Bush, Secretary Rice and Members of the House and Senate foreign affairs committees. According to The New Anatolian, here is what a leading AKP Member of Parliament and Chair of the Foreign Affairs Commission, Mehmet Dulger, had to say about Turkish deployment in Lebanon and US policies and actions throughout the region. Turkish soldiers may face resistance in Lebanon because we're Sunni, but the Lebanese are mostly Shiite. Plus there are all kind of extremist minorities in Lebanon like Armenians and Greek Orthodox groups. They would never welcome a Turkish presence in Lebanon. This is a kind of war that was almost predestined, developed and strategically designed long ago. The US is one of the players, and it's clear this is part of their grand plan for the Middle East. More and more, Turkish and American interests in the region are at odds, our policies and theirs on the terrorist Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK), Israeli aggression, and Iran and Syria aren't parallel. So once we work with the US, our interests are being harmed. The US could be here for 50 years, but our neighbors will always be here. With this AKP worldview, it should be no surprise that Turkey is slipping on the road to EU membership. The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, is due to release a progress report on Turkey late next month. As observed by the International Herald Tribune on September 4, there is growing concern that the momentum for reform has dramatically slowed since entry talks began last year. Turkey has, for example, been slow in enacting a promised law guaranteeing the property rights of the Christian minority, while a controversial article of the penal code used to prosecute writers and intellectuals remains on the books. Reinforcing these concerns are the more than 300 proposed amendments to the EU progress report on Turkey, including 26 on Armenian issues. When America's leaders next meet with their Turkish counterparts, they must deal with the reality vs. the promise of Turkey. That reality is a nation unreconciled with its past, conflicted between the West and its unique Islamist interpretation and increasingly leaning towards Islamist remedies. The promise of a democratic, officially secular, culturally Muslim state, which is respectful of its minorities, at peace with its neighbors and an integral part of Europe, is increasingly distant. In the weeks ahead, encourage the Co-chairs of the Congressional Caucus on Armenian Issues and principled realists on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to communicate our community's perspectives and concerns.",Anonymous,Armenian Reporter,2006-09-09,1
"SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 was set to be a red-letter day for me. I was about to cast my first ever vote in an American election. I had become an American citizen some years before, but had never got around to voting mainly because of sheer laziness. Finally I was going to do it. So that beautiful fall morning I set off from my apartment on the Upper East Side to the local public school to cast my first ever vote in an American election. There was a primary for mayor of New York and I wanted to support then city Comptroller Alan Hevesi, who had been an outstanding friend on Irish issues. Having cast my vote I took the time to walk back to my apartment very pleased with myself. Strangely enough, though, terrorism was on my mind. The night before I had attended a lecture by Senator George Mitchell, hero of the Irish peace process, on the Middle East conflict, which he had been engaged in as a negotiator. There was a torrential rain shower, and yet the crowds had turned out in their hundreds to see Mitchell speak at the Park Avenue church on the search for peace in the Middle East. He did not disappoint. Uncannily as it turned out, Mitchell had spoken about his fears that terrorism from the Middle East could become a global concern. It was a time of savage but effective suicide bombings in Israel, and Mitchell's point was that such tactics could well be tried in other places in other conflicts. I'm sure, however, he didn't have a location a few miles from where he was speaking in mind. Back home in the apartment the world began to quickly come apart. Irish Voice advertising director Stephen Travers called to say that he was listening to a report on his car radio that a plane had struck the World Trade Center. The initial report was that it was a commuter jet. I remember an uneasy feeling. I had read a book some years before by a friend of mine, journalist Jim Dwyer, on the 1993 World Trade Center bombings when Muslim militants had tried to blow the buildings up with a car bomb. Dwyer had been clear that it was quite likely they could try again, at that or some other target and that they hadn't gone away you know. On the television the reports were coming in thick and fast of dreadful scenes at the Trade Center. RTE, Irish national radio, was on the phone and I was trying to sort out the chaotic scene for them. I had just mentioned the Dwyer book and its dire prophecy that those who attempted to blowup the World Trade Center in 1993 were not finished trying when out of the corner of my eye the second plane swooped in and smashed into the other tower. My first thought was a ridiculous one. Did this mean that we would not be able to print the Irish Voice this Tuesday? Strange, isn't it, that in the midst of the most astonishing tragedy your first thoughts are an attempt to impose some normalcy on a world gone mad. I went up to the roof of my apartment building and looked at the massive plume of black smoke belching out all over lower Manhattan. Some on the roof with me prayed. We knew there had to be thousands dead. The next few hours are a blur. I made it into my office and found a staff even more shell-shocked than I was. A friend whose daughter was in school near the Trade Center called frantic with worry. Another friend, Irish Times journalist Conor O'Clery, whose apartment was just a few blocks away from the WTC called to tell me of the horrific scenes he was witnessing. To this day he will not watch tapes of that awful day. Manhattan was a ghost town that evening as we walked home. How fragile our everyday lives suddenly seemed in the face of such an awful tragedy. Yet there was an unmistakable spirit too, in the people we did meet, in the rush to help at Ground Zero, in the myriad of stories already emerging of incredible bravery in a terrible time. Three days later, helped by a friendly police officer I was down at Ground Zero myself, along with O'Clery. We gazed at the scene which looked like a nuclear winter with white ash covering every available yard of space, buildings crumpled like dolls houses and exhausted rescue workers everywhere. The full scale of the tragedy hit home. This was truly a new era of evil.","O'Dowd, Niall",Irish Voice,2006-09-06,1
"SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 was the worst of times. The events of that day have shaped all of our lives since, and not for the better, no matter what corner of the globe we live in. Every generation has a defining moment and this was ours, not the victory over Nazism as it was for our fathers, but rather the uncomprehending sense that our world as we knew it was being torn apart as we watched the Twin Towers fall. Yes, we knew there was the running sore of the Middle East and that we were hated from afar. After the collapse of communism however, it seemed our world was about to be a better place and such problems could be solved. The tenor of the times was captured by the political scientist Francis Fukuyama who wrote a best seller about the End of History that the West had won, and that all the world problems were about to be solved. Instead we were back in an historical time warp. It was Muslim against Christians and Jews in a replay from the dawn of religion. The span of centuries had not diminished the hatreds one iota, it seemed. It was hard to comprehend at the time how the world was changing in front of our eyes. America was a nation utterly assured of its invincibility and its safety from attack. Two great oceans formed the perfect barrier to invasion. Our role as the only superpower surely gave us complete control over our lives. Then came the planes and we found ourselves utterly adrift, all the old safety mechanisms powerless to help us. Our mighty army could not stop what happened, there was no government directly to blame. We longed for the old certainties. It was not to be. They were gone forever. When the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were attacked our sense of invulnerability was lost forever. Mere anarchy was loosed upon the world. Since then we have been a weakened giant, aware like never before of our vulnerabilities. The bombers have done their work in Madrid and London. Every day it seems there are airport alerts. An undercurrent of constant fear runs through our lives. Our world will never be the same. Now we have war in Iraq, and still in Afghanistan, where a major offensive against the Taliban has just commenced. We have saber rattling over Iran and possibly North Korea. The nightmare of endless enemies seemingly confronts us. Worse, America's place in the world is under fire. When the Twin Towers tragedy happened a leading French newspaper wrote that we are all Americans now. Sadly that solidarity has long since faded and Americans, mostly because of the war in Iraq, now face international hostility on a global scale. It should not be so. This country, despite its flaws, has always stood for democracy, whether it was destroying the Nazis or ending the nightmare of communism for so many Eastern European countries. America is not the enemy; fundamentalism of whatever stripe is. We have seen the Koran and the Torah and the Bible used to justify every kind of killing imaginable, as if the great religious tracts were more about hate than love. We have clerics of all stripes who urge their armies on, daring them to do their worst. At the Twin Towers and the Pentagon they did. In this brave new world we must not allow their hatreds to consume us all and force us into a terrible game of an eye for an eye. As Nobel Peace laureate John Hume often remarked, such a strategy merely leaves us all blind. Politics, diplomacy and hope, must be our tools, and not war.",Anonymous,Irish Voice,2006-09-06,1
"YOU think the hardened American position on immigration is not something that any Irish person could support? Well, according to leaks to the Irish papers over the past week, the new U.S. rules on immigration will be the model for an unprecedented crackdown on illegal immigrants into Ireland in the near future. Controversial new immigration legislation is now being finalized in the Department of Justice here and will be coming before the Cabinet for approval in the next week or two before being brought into the Dail (Parliament) this autumn to be passed into law. If anything, what is being proposed here will go even further than the American system for controlling immigration. The new measures here, for example, will oblige all non-EU nationals in Ireland to carry biometric ID cards, with details of their residence permits condensed on the electronic strip along with fingerprints or eye prints. The present system which allows for lengthy appeals and legal challenges (by which time the applicants up to now have frequently established mots or even had an Irish baby) is also to be simplified, and with that in mind the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is to be scrapped altogether. The existing complicated legal system for so-called asylum seekers is to be replaced by a single law called the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill. The new system will also have real teeth - from now on the Gardai (police) will have a legal basis for the immediate detention and deportation of illegal immigrants they find. The new law will prevent the endless court challenges by which illegal immigrants can now frustrate the system. Why is such a dramatic tightening up of the system here happening at this point? The answer, of course, is that there is an election on the way next year. Recent polls have shown that, in spite of the decadelong economic boom that has made Ireland one of the richest countries in the world, Fianna Fail may struggle to get back into power again. The voters now take the economic boom for granted, and instead of showing their gratitude in the polls for their new level of prosperity they are turning against the present government because of other issues. And perhaps the biggest of these issues is immigration. So Fianna Fail is now moving to sort this out and defuse public concern and anger before next year's election. This dissatisfaction does not emerge in public very often, mainly because people have no way of expressing how they feel, apart from phone calls to radio shows or letters to newspapers. But the media, like the political system, is so worried about appearing politically incorrect - or even racist - that it limits even that access and tries to keep the lid on the issue. And, of course, many of the commentators are politically correct journalists and academics who piously support the notion of a multi-cultural society, even though they themselves live in the better areas and leave the immigrants and their problems to the poorer inner city and deprived outer suburb areas and the people who live there. Added to this media consensus that mass immigration here is a desirable development for the country are the members of the huge immigration industry that has grown up - comprising lawyers, social workers and state offices and bodies set up to assist immigrants - which is entirely funded by the taxpayer. The total bill for dealing with immigration and its consequences is now estimated at around half a billion euro a year. Most ordinary voters resent all this and would much prefer to see that huge amount of money being spent on our overcrowded hospitals and our dilapidated school buildings, many of which are a disgrace. Above all, ordinary voters deeply resent being force-fed a diet of multi-cultural propaganda which they do not accept and which is being paid for by their taxes. There are two levels of the immigration issue that have to be addressed - immigrants from the new EU countries and immigrants from non-EU countries. Of course, the principle of free movement within the EU makes dealing with the first of these more complicated. But there is now a growing feeling that something will need to be done. The huge immigration we have had from the new EU countries in Eastern Europe worries a lot of people here, concerned about the pressure on housing, hospitals and schools and about the depressing effect on pay rates. Ireland was one of only three EU countries (the others being Britain and Sweden) which gave unrestricted access to workers from the ten new EU states in 2004. The effect has been to push the boom here even harder, but as that begins to slow down there are obvious difficulties ahead, on top of the huge pressure already being put on state services here like health and education. And many people here feel that the boom-and the influx of immigrants it attracted - was of limited value to them. All they see is foreigners on the supermarket checkouts and on the building sites and in the A&E lines. To deal with this, the government has decided that immigrants from the two new countries due to join the EU next year, Bulgaria and Romania, will need permits to get in here. There may also be changes in the rules for immigrants from the 10 countries who joined in 2004 (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, etc.), maintaining or even extending the rules which limit their access to benefits to prevent so-called benefit tourism. The other part of tighter immigration control is dealing with those who arrive here from outside the EU, many without papers and claiming they need asylum. The new law being introduced to tighten the system and make it quicker is aimed mainly at them. In addition to the measures outlined above, the new legislation will make it a legal duty for all foreigners who have no valid legal residence permit to leave the state. By failing to do so they will be guilty of an offense. Illegal immigrants or asylum seekers will also be barred from getting married in Ireland and then using that as a basis for residence. And there will be changes to the welfare payments system for these immigrants and to their housing arrangements. One of the most significant changes will be that in future asylum seekers will have to prove how they traveled to Ireland and why they fled their countries of origin. Strict standards of credibility will be established, and cooperation with the process will be mandatory for all asylum seekers and prospective immigrants. This is similar to the U.S., where immigration law puts the onus on the applicant to prove that they need asylum. This will make a stark contrast with what goes on here now, with asylum seekers deliberately destroying documents before they arrive so they can't easily be sent back, and then pretending that they don't know how they got here so they can't be sent back to the first EU country they arrived in which is where they are supposed to apply for asylum. Asylum seekers will also have to live in designated reception centers here while their cases are heard - with decisions reached in weeks or months rather than years. This will go some way to preventing so many illegal immigrants vanishing into the crowd here, and it will also put an end to the present system where some Irish landlords are making huge amounts of money from providing lousy accommodation. There is also increasing concern here about the ease with which many immigrants from Muslim countries in the Middle East have got in here. Some links between some people living here and global terrorism have been exposed, most recently in connection with the plot to bomb planes from the U.K. to the U.S. Whether those concerned are merely fundraisers for so-called Muslim charities or organizational and operational links for something more sinister remains to be seen. But there is enough evidence already for concern that Ireland might be used as an easy safe haven. The new legislation will make it possible to revoke residence permits where, as a matter of probability, the holder of such a permit is suspected of being a security threat of any kind. In relation to the amount of immigration from the new EU states, the trendy lefties here had the wind taken out of their sails earlier this year when the Labor Party leader Pat Rabbitte, of all people, called for restrictions on workers from new EU member states coming to Ireland. In an interview he said, The time may be coming when we will have to sit down and examine whether we would have to look at whether a work permit regime ought to be implemented in terms of some of the non-national labor. There are 40 million or so Poles, so it is an issue that we have to look at, (meaning that we cannot take unrestricted numbers in here without damaging the position of Irish workers). With the Labor Party recognizing the way the political wind is blowing, is it any surprise that the present government is now tackling the immigration issue? Sidebar Ireland is on the verge of adopting new immigration laws which will anger protestors like those pictured outside the Garda National Immigration Bureau in Dublin last week.","Spain, John",Irish Voice,2006-08-30,1
"Our Beloved Vasylko, We celebrate a glorious life that in 19 short years touched so many hearts with so much love, that with our Archbishop Yurij's blessing, Vasylko lay in state in our Cathedral, where over two thousand came to the Panachyda to declare their grieving, loss and love. Even more came the next day to the funeral. His young contemporaries came in all colors and creeds. Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and Buddhist, gathered strength and prayed together in the Cathedral. They may not have understood the words of the prayers sung in Ukrainian, but they told us that they felt the depth of the fervent prayers and the responses sung by your beloved Capella Bandura Brothers and over 60 voices of the choir. All this in the Cathedral which he loved and where he served since his Baba Ruzia sewed him his special Stychar (altar boy robe) when he was five years old, and up to his last service on his 19th birthday, this last April 2. His fellow readers held an overnight vigil of prayers and psalms, just to be with him. Vasylko studied advanced mathematics at Kumon, where he stood in the top 10th percentile in North America. He was already ill when he wrote his last Chemistry exam, and although he just couldn't finish, he got an 87 percent and apologized that if he could have finished, he may have easily hit the 90's. He also mentored fellow students in his class, to do their very best. He was excited that he was accepted to four colleges, and knew exactly what he wanted to excel in. He had already established the roadmap for his future. Will's athletic abilities were natural and outstanding, particularly in skiing, snow boarding, basketball, volleyball, soccer and track and field. He won several gold medals in skiing at his favorite Holimont Ski Club in Ellicottville, N.Y. Will's true strength was his inner magnet that drew everyone who had goodness and love in their hearts. Hundreds of beautiful girls declared how they loved him genuinely, and his male friends learned that grown men do cry, and hugging was good as an expression of love. He was the role model for every life he touched. From his hospital bed he even made sure that his Dido's birthday would be celebrated in the company of Dido's grandchildren at the annual Blue Jay outing, but we had to take a rain check for him. His sister Katya always loved to hug him, and immediately declared that, as his older sister, her job was to be Will's official tormentor. He let her do it because he knew that with his consent she would not enjoy it. Will and Katya became bound to each other, closer than anyone could be, right to the end, and forever in their hearts. As a talented bandura musician and gifted with a deep bass voice. Will was a proud member of the Canadian Bandurists Capella for the past five years, where he bonded deeply with his choir brothers. livery Thursday's rehearsal was a special outing with his father and his bandura family. All this is the result of the upbringing of Will's loving mother Gloria, and his father Walter, whose loss of their fourth generation Kozak is unimaginable. Your Dido Wasyl, Baba Ruzia, Baba Valia, Teta Katrusia, Dyiadko Igor, Chresna Irene, Chresny Jaro and your loving cousins, Sasha, Jamie, Simon and Christina will never forget you.

"BEIRUT, Lebanon, Aug. 23 - Lebanon and its Armenian community have been hit hard by more than bombs this summer. Yet I have witnessed not just its negative side; there is a positive side as well. The negative sides are well known in the Armenian Diaspora: economic hardships, young people fleeing the country, and the like. But the positive impact of the situation is worth appreciating, because it speaks of something good emerging from this disaster. Not long after the attacks on Lebanon's towns, cities and bridges began, the Armenian community braced itself for the human toll of this war. And, before long, waves of refugees began streaming towards the capital, Beirut, and its eastern and northern suburbs, all of which contain Armenian homes, businesses and institutions. One of those institutions, in the predominantly Muslim, western part of Beirut, was the Armenian Evangelical College. In a very short time, over 100 persons filled classrooms and even hallways in the school building. Members of the First Armenian Evangelical Church, which oversees the school, got involved in helping these families obtain basic needs, such as bedding, water, food and medicine. Haigazian University next door also brought its contribution to the effort. From the president, Dr. Paul Haidostian, to the Student Life Office, to the students themselves, many people were involved in caring for these internally displaced families, some from Beirut's southern suburbs, and some from villages in the south. Under the leadership of Peggy Bedoyan, Studcnl Life Activities Coordinator, a group of energetic and dedicated students planned hours of activities nearly every weekday. The children, most of whom had very little contact outside their communities and religious groups, very quickly adopted these Armenian and Arab, Christian and Muslim university students as their own. With their noses pressed against the glass doors, they anxiously awaited each day's crafts, puzzles, contests, board games, table tennis, basketball and soccer games. One day, in the first week of the conflict, an unexpected telephone call came: the parish priest and council members of the nearby Soi.rp Nshan Cathedral wanted to contribute their part in the care of these families. Father Mgrdich Keshishian said they were bringing hot meals to the families at the College, and so this on-the-ground ecumenism not only gave nourishment to the displaced, but it also brought a much-needed boost to the general morale of the crew of helpers. In Ashrafieh, nearly 200 persons, from infants to the elderly, crammed into the Geitawi Public School. Rev. and Mrs. Soghomon Kilaghbian, from the nearby Armenian Evangelical Church, decided that their church and youth needed to reach out to these families, who seemed to be overlooked by the various governmental and private relief efforts. They, too, organized activities several times a week, and very quickly won the hearts of the children and their parents. As in other locations, the children were sad to think of having to leave these newfound, caring friends when the war ended. Up in the hills outside Beirut, near Mansourieh, another group of families fleeing the bombardments found refuge in the Kchag Conference Center. Having been abandoned only recently after years of Syrian army occupation, and in a state of disrepair, nonetheless two of its useable cabins became home to over fifty persons. Again, youth from the Emmanuel Armenian Evangelical Church did their best to have activities for the children, while adults, such as Maria Bakalian, Chairman of the Christian Endeavor youth organization behind much of these efforts, brought supplies, encouragement, and a listening ear ¼ the elders. And then it was over. The cease-fire was declared, and within a very few days all of the families gathered what they had and left for their homes and villages, in most cases not knowing what to expect. And those in the Armenian community were left with a feeling of emptiness, wondering what these children, whose tumultuous summer they shared, were doing, and how they were coping with the destruction. This is just a small sample of how part of the Armenian community responded in this crisis. There is so much more to tell, from the Armenian Apostolic and Catholic Church relief work, to Armenian and international organizations such as Karageusian, Jinishian and World Vision, to the sacrificial efforts of individuals, like one young husband and father named Sevag, who took the initiative to visit refugee centers to give free haircuts, in order to provide a more hygienic environment. And the aftershocks, particularly economic ones, continue to shake this small minority in Lebanon. All these efforts will help to bridge divisions between communities and faiths, and will ultimately be for the good of Lebanon. Yet this openhearted response does not surprise me, because the Lebanese-Armenians are the children of refugees and survivors, and they know what it means to be a stranger in a strange land. They gratefully remember how blessed they were to be received in these lands, and know that they can do no less when they see someone else in need, and will embrace them in the name of the One who said, When you do it to the least of these, my brethren, you do it to me.",Rev L Nishan Bakalian,Armenian Reporter,2006-08-26,1
"Headnote COMMENTARY Something is changing in the Turks' sense of who they are. You hear it from cab drivers or columnists, old friends and fresh acquaintances. For a long time, the Turks put their Turkish identity first, snubbing their Muslim neighborhood. Now they're acting like members of the Muslim umma. The Justice and Development Party (AKP), which assumed power in November 2002, is driving this change. Rooted in Turkey's Islamist opposition, the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been widening the wedges between Turkey and the West, while building bridges with the Muslim Middle East. If anyone had doubts about the AKP's Islamism, the proof is in the party's foreign-policy pudding. Since the AKP took over, Turkish attitudes toward the U.S. have soured significantly. Four years of harsh criticism of American foreign policy in the Middle East - last year's U.S. military incursions into Fallujah, for example, were officially a genocide in Turkey - has created what could be a permanent dent in public opinion. Whereas in the pre-Erdogan period typically more than half the Turks expressed favorable views of the U.S., a Pew Center survey last month showed that only 12% of Turks view America positively. In that study, the U.S. gets lower marks in Turkey than in Egypt or Jordan. Some of the blame lies with Washington. American unwillingness to take action against the terrorist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in northern Iraq is a source of frustration. Lately, Turkish casualties resulting from PKK attacks have been mounting at a rate close to that experienced by U.S. forces in Iraq. The civilian carnage in Iraq itself has added to the frustration. But then, there is something peculiar about anti-Americanism in Turkey under the AKP. Before them, the Turks were America's best friends in the Muslim world. The current government's alternative is the Muslim Middle East. The AKP is also alienating Turkey's other traditional ally in the region, Israel. A good example came earlier this year when Mr. Erdogan met with the leader of Hamas's military wing, Khaled Mashaal. in Ankara, despite criticism from the West and pro-Western Turks. The AKP has continued to defend the visit and keep contacts with Mr. Mashaal and generally oppose Western efforts to isolate Hamas. The party has an intense and bizarre interest in all Muslim causes. Last month, Mr. Erdogan lambasted Israel for trying to wipe out the Palestinians in Lebanon. On the same day, a PKK terror attack killed five Turkish soldiers. But Mr. Erdogan, who failed to mention the PKK in his speech, seems more interested in what happens to Hezbollah than to Turkish soldiers. Nor does he dwell upon the parallels between the PKK and Hezbollah, two terrorist groups that violate international borders (the first Turkey from northern Iraq, the second Israel from southern Lebanon). His foreign policy gives the impression that Muslim causes are more important than Turkish ones. Mr. Erdogan's change of tone on the Mideast isn't without consequences. The media have run virulently antiSemitic articles - a dreadful development in a country that has prided itself on saving Jews who fled the Spanish Inquisition as well as the Nazis. A recent anti-Israel demonstration in Istanbul attracted around 100,000 people. Before the AKP, anti-Israeli protests would have drawn just a few hundred die-hard jihadists. The AKP's heart lies in the Muslim world. Analysts have credibly suggested that the party is linked to the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood (Ikhwan) movement in the Arab world. Whereas Egypt and Jordan, which consider the Ikhwan a serious internal threat, would not touch the new Hamas government with a 10-foot pole, the AKP courts the Palestinian extension of the Ikhwan. If Islamist ideology constitutes one part of the AKP's foreign-policy calculus, domestic aspirations are another. The AKP's conundrum is that it s not supported by a majority of Turks, and the party has used a populist foreign policy that bashes the West to boost its domestic standing. This is working: Not only are Turkish attitudes toward the U.S. spoiling, but also the AKP now draws broad support for its foreign policy. If Turks think of themselves as Muslims first in the foreign-policy arena, then one day they'll think of themselves as Muslims in the domestic one. A telltale sign of the growth of Islamist sentiments is the surge in Islamist media. In the last four years, Islamist newspapers have boomed in Turkey. Combined circulation figures for the Islamist press in Turkey have almost tripled to more than 1.1 million today from 441,200 in 2001. The AKP shows that, once in government, Islamist parties bring about change in unexpected ways. The party's foreign policy is scratching away the Turks' sense of national identity, while infusing a strong sense of Muslim nationalism into Turkish society instead. Whether this transformation continues after elections in 2007 will depend on whether secular. Western-minded Turks, long unable to provide a captivating political message, will successfully challenge the AKP. If not, a second AKP government might well turn Turkey into an unrecognizable country - somehow democratic, superficially secular, and definitely not Western.

"IRISH Americans flooded the ABC switchboard this week complaining that that its Primetime show which aired last Thursday had called an Irish woman the last known terrorist to try and bomb an Israeli plane. But she was no terrorist. On April 17 1986, a pregnant young woman, Anne Murphy, a white, Catholic girl from Dublin, presented herself at London-Heathrow's Gate 23 for that morning's El Al flight to Tel Aviv to meetthe parents of her fiancé, a Palestinian. She had cleared the airport's own security checkin procedures, but to El Al's security staff something didn't appear right. A search of her hand luggage revealed 42 grams of semtex and a detonator, hidden in a calculator. The explosives had been planted by her boyfriend, Nezar Hindawi, a terrorist with links to the Libyan government. The U.K government broke off diplomatic relations with Syria following revelations of official complicity in Hindawi's plot to blow up the El Al airliner and he was sentenced to 45 years in jail. Murphy, not a terrorist, is currently living in Wicklow. The ABC show was bombarded with angry calls from Irish Americans after the show aired. The show is no longer on their website. ABC did not comment on the case to the Irish Voice. Now being used as an example of why racial profiling does not work, Murphy has been unearthed as the token terrorist, despite protests that she was a mere pawn in a terrorist plot. The Irish Voice was unable to locate her in Ireland. Back in 1986 Murphy passed through initial screening but, a series of questions alerted the security checkers of El Al that all was not well with the heavily pregnant Murphy. When El Al security learned she had a Muslim boyfriend not traveling with her, they scrutinized her luggage. Eventually, they emptied it, weighed it, discovered that the weight was incorrect and found the bomb.","Brennan, Georgina",Irish Voice,2006-08-23,1
"Elif Shafak is a Turkish novelist who has spent much of her life in Europe and the United States. She fills her books with characters who defy all orthodoxy, and in her journalism she lives by the same coda, mixing feminism and nuanced political analysis with a deep interest in Ottoman culture. She has been much criticized by literary purists for using words of Arabic and Persian origin that the reformers of the early republic worked so hard to expunge, and for drawing on Sufi traditions that continue to inform popular culture 80 years after those same reformers banned Turkey's dervish sects. She has a particular genius for depicting backstreet Istanbul, where the myriad cultures of the Ottoman Empire are still in tangled evidence on every family tree. In her sixth and most recent novel, The Bastard of Istanbul, which is already a best seller in Turkey and will be published in the United States by Viking next year, one character declares: My father is Barsam Tchakhmakhchian, my great-uncle is Dikran Stamboulian, his father is Varvant Istanboluian, my name is Armanoush Tchakhmakhchian, all my family tree has Something Somethingian, and I am the grandchild of genocide survivors who lost all their relatives in the hands of Turkish butchers in 1915, but I myself have been brainwashed to deny the genocide because I was raised by some Turk named Mustapha! These are strong words in a country whose official historians maintain that the Armenian genocide at the hands of Turks is itself fiction. In February 2005, when Orhan Pamuk, Turkey's most famous novelist, said in passing to a Swiss journalist that a million Armenians had been killed in these lands, and I am the only one who talks about it, he was branded a traitor and prosecuted for denigrating Turkishness. Shafak must have known that she was risking the same, as she has frequently challenged Turkey's treatment of its minorities. In September, she spoke at a conference at Bilgi University in Istanbul - the first Turkish conference ever to challenge the official line on the Ottoman Armenians - and though she went on to state her own position clearly and unequivocally in several newspapers, the censors left her alone. But early last month, Shafak learned that she was to be prosecuted for, among other things, allowing a character of partly Armenian heritage in The Bastard of Istanbul to utter the forbidden G-word. He trial is scheduled for Sept 21. Since its inceptions in 1923, the Turkish Republic has policed its writers fiercely. Its penal code, taken from Mussolini's Italy, puts serious curbs on freedom of expression, but Turkey's leading writers have never toed the line. The great modernist poet Nazim Hikmet spent much of his adult life in prison and died in exile. The novelist Yashar Kemal, for many decades Turkey's most famous writer, has been serially harassed and prosecuted. During the 70's, 80's and 90's, so many writers, journalists and scholars were imprisoned for their views that a prosecution became a badge of honor: if you had not yet angered the state, then perhaps you hadn't said anything of importance. But 18 months ago, the rules of the game looked set to change. The European Union had at last set a date for talks on Turkish accession. The long conflict with Kurdish separatists was apparently over, and the Kurds had been accorded limited cultural rights, encouraged by the prospect of entry into the European Union, other previously silent Muslim and non-Muslim minorities were beginning to make themselves heard. It was finally possible to tap the rich multicultural Ottoman legacies that nationalist ideology had so long repressed. There was a new vogue for family memoirs. Some showed how peacefully the empire's diverse nations had once coexisted. Others - like Fethiye Cetin's My Grandmother, in which the author recounts her discovery that her grandmother was in fact Armeman - explored suppressed histories. In Europe, a new generation of bicultural Turks were mixing Turkish and Ottoman traditions with European forms and winning prestigious prizes. As Pamuk's star rose in the West, many other Turkish novelists - Shafak, Latife Tekin, Asli Erdogan and Perihan Magden - had their works translated. All were writing sophisticated fiction that refused to conform to national - or nationalist - modes. In so doing, they seemed to be reflecting the mood of the country as a whole. An overwhelming majority wanted to join the European Union. Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the pro-market, pro-Europe Islamist prime minister, had committed himself to a new penal code that promised to bring Turkey into line with European norms. The hope was that the European Union process would force the ossified machinery of state of modernize. What few people predicted was that the new penal code would become the vehicle for backlash by expanding curbs on freedom of expression. Article 301 recommends sentences of up to three years for those convicted of denigrating Turkishness or insulting the judiciary or other state organs, while other articles make it an offense to insult the memory of Ataturk or seek to alienate people from military service. A recently revised anti-terror law is so broadly written that it will, human rights groups claim, make it a crime to espouse any view that is shared by an outlawed group or even to publish a statement by an illegal organization. To date, there have been more that 60 cases brought against novelists, publishers, journalists, scholars, politicians and cartoonists. Hrant Dink, the editor of the Turkish-Armenian weekly Agos, currently has two cases against him open. The publisher Fatih Tas is on trial for publishing a book (by the political scientist John Tirman of M.I.T.) that takes a critical look at the Turkish Army. Two eminent professors faced charges for saying, in a never-published government-commissioned report, that Turkey's treatment of its minorities fell short of European standards, while the magazine Penguen and one of its cartoonists were prosecuted for portraying the prime minister as a kitten and an elephant, among other animals. So far, no one has been sent to prison. Some defendants have been acquitted; others, like Pamuk, have seen their cases dropped on technicalities, while many have been given suspended sentences that were then converted to fines. But to assume that writers have nothing to fear is to underestimate the forces behind these prosecutions. It is still not clear how Article 301 found its way into the new penal code, but the Unity of Jurists, an ultra-nationalist lawyers group, is behind most of the high-profile prosecutions. Its main spokesman is a lawyer named Kemal Kerincsiz. His rabidly xenophobic sound bites have turned him into a nationalist celebrity, and his words are echoed by the thugs who have taunted, assaulted and insulted defendants and observers in the corridors of the courthouses, denouncing them as traitors and missionary children (a reference to the foreign schools many of the defendants attended) and spouting racist slogans that call to mind Berlin in 1935, while the riot police look on. In certain corners of the state apparatus there must be others who believe, like Kerincsiz, that the European Union means slavery and a prisoner's chains for Turkey. They must be rejoicing that the trials have seriously damaged the case for Europe inside Turkey, while also giving fodder to anti-Turkish nationalists in Europe. Most of all, they must be pleased that the European Union has now signaled that the 301 trials are serious impediments to accession. This is not a tug of war between East and West as the West likes to understand it: while some of Turkey's new ultranationalists are Islamists, most are old-guard, die-hard secularists. The battle is about democracy, with supporters of European Union membership hoping for peaceful change and opponents hoping for a return to authoritarian rule. How best to help the writers caught in the middle? Because Kerincsiz and his colleagues have successfully labeled foreign trial observers as spies and agitators, many in Turkey believe that non-Turkish human rights groups should keep their mouths shut. But if the ultra-nationalists are allowed to continue their campaign unchallenged, they stand a very good chance of winning. And if they do, the oldest stable secular state in the Muslim world will cease to democratize, and a brave new literature will die.

"ANTELIAS, Lebanon, Aug. 11 - In the context of an interview with representatives of French TV channels and newspapers, His Holiness said: It is not possible to impose political solution through military means. It is a plain fact that there is a problem between Israel and Lebanon. This problem must be seriously addressed by both states on the basis of security, justice and peace for all. Therefore, a cease fire is a condition sine qua non to embark on political negotiation. Referring to the declaration made by Christian and Muslim spiritual leaders, Catholicos Aram I said: The internal unity of Lebanon is solid. More than ever, all the communities and political parties are united. As religious leaders, we gave our full support to the project of the government aiming at a comprehensive settlement of the conflict. His Holiness once again criticized the failure of the international community to stop the violence: The repercussion of the ongoing violence is terrible in terms of loss of human lives and destruction of infrastructures of Lebanon. Violence generates more violence. What is needed now is the creation of an atmosphere of mutual understanding. I believe that religion must play an instrumental role in promoting mutual respect and tolerance. His Holiness emphasized the unique importance of Lebanon as a country of coexistence, tolerance and mutual trust. Such a Lebanon is a great asset for the whole region.

"IRISH airlines and passengers suffered severe disruption as extra security measures were introduced at airports across the country when the alleged plot to detonate bombs on U.S.-bound flights from Britain was exposed last week. As in Britain and the U.S. the additional precautions included restrictions on hand luggage, although for outward-bound Irish flights the restrictions were less severe. Aer Lingus and Ryanair didn't impose any hand luggage restrictions for journeys from Ireland to Britain so long as passengers weren't taking connecting flights. But passengers flying inwards were only allowed to carry a limited number of items on board with them in a clear plastic bag. Also, passengers traveling to the U.S. were not allowed to carry liquids in their hand baggage, including beverages, shampoo, suntan lotion, creams, tooth paste and hair gel - restrictions imposed by American authorities. Duty free sales at Dublin and Shannon airports were restricted in response to a request from the U.S. authorities. A Dublin Airports Authority spokeswoman said, We have not sold alcohol or perfume products to passengers flying directly to the U.S. Passenger safety is taken into account first and foremost, rather than sales. Shannon Airport spokeswoman Claire McEnery said the ban on duty free alcohol and perfume sales would probably continue indefinitely until they work out a solution to get around it. She added, It has implications for the airport in terms of revenue. Dozens of flights were cancelled or severely delayed in the first 24 hours of the crisis. Outward services returned almost to normal by the weekend although inward flights, especially from Britain, continued to be disrupted. Several travelers complained of items stolen from their luggage including laptops, iPods and cell phones. One claimed the extra security measures had created a thieves charter. But the airlines denied they had any reports of widespread theft. A Ryanair spokesperson advised, People should not pack valuable items. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary and British Airways' Irish-born chief executive Willie Walsh led a cacophony of loud protests by the airline industry about the British Airport Authority's handling of the crisis. O'Leary, whose company was forced to continue to cancel flights to Ireland early this week from its main London base, Stansted, because of lengthening lines, urged the British government to draft in police and army reservists to speed up searches at security checkpoints. He also called for the requirement that all passengers be searched to be eased. We don't need to be body-searching young children traveling with their parents on holiday to Spain, he said. O'Leary also argued that although the plot to bomb trans-Atlantic flights had been foiled, the terrorists still had cause for celebration. The goal of these terrorists and extremists is not just to kill but also to disrupt the economic life of Britain, he said. The U.K. government, by insisting on these heavy-handed security measures, is allowing the extremists to achieve many of their objectives. Walsh also voiced his dismay at the ongoing measures. In Ireland it wasn't just passengers at the major airports whose travel plans were affected. Knock Airport lost six of its services to Britain last Thursday. Margaret Fulwood from Shropshire in England had been at a wedding in Barna, Connemara. She was due back at work but her flight to Birmingham was among those cancelled. Like most passengers in the early stages of the crisis she accepted the situation with humor. The dog's going to have to spend another night in kennels, she said. The crisis also turned the spotlight on the Muslim community in Ireland, where differences of opinion emerged about the prospects of extremism among young Irish Muslims. Sheikh Dr. Shaheed Satardien, a leading member of the Supreme Muslim Council of Ireland, claimed other Irish Islamic leaders were in denial about the fact that Irish Muslims aged 14 upwards were becoming radicalized, often when they travel to and from their parents' country of origin. He said that when there they were subjected to antiwestern and radical viewpoints which, when they returned to Ireland, contributed to a sense of being caught between two cultures. He told The Irish Times, Plotting and planning might be happening here in Ireland. We can't say. We don't know what is going on in the minds and hearts of young Muslims here. I am very, very concerned. Dr. Satardien warned that Ireland, like Britain, could become a target for terrorist attacks by young Irish-based Muslims who are increasingly angry about the ongoing situation in the Middle East. There was disagreement from the director of the Islamic Cultural Centre in Clonskeagh, Co. Dublin. Dr Nooh al-Kaddo said, Of course the current situation in Lebanon is increasing the level of feeling. Of course three are feelings of frustration among the young, but definitely not to the extent which Dr. Satardien has claimed. I don't know where he got his information from. Dr. al-Kaddo, who lived in Britain for 17 years before moving to Ireland, added, From what I see on the ground level, things are very different to the U.K.","Clancy, Paddy",Irish Voice,2006-08-16,1

"Headnote HOW ARMENIANS IN LEBANON ARE COPING WITH THE ONGOING WAR BEIRUT, July 26 (AFP) - From the evacuation of Yasser Arafat in 1982 to the current foreign exodus, Makrouhie Yerganian has seen the troubled history of Lebanon unscroll in front of her eyes at her vantage point in front of the Beirut port. Just last week, two truck drivers having coffee were killed when their parked and apparently empty vehicles were blown apart in an Israeli air strike on the edge of the port, just 50 meters away from her modest home in a three-story apartment block. It was a very strange noise that rattled our nerves. We thought we had heard all sorts of explosions but this was something new even for us, says the Lebanese Armenian schoolteacher who has lived in the Mar Mikhael area for more than half a century. Her 85-year-old mother was just about to water the flowers on the window ledge, until Yerganian changed her mind. Many of the windows in her building were shattered, but the women escaped unharmed from Israel's latest salvo in its war on Hezbollah. I believe it is written on your forehead. If it is written, you can die wherever you are. But that day, the Lord protected us, she says in her sitting room where sheets cover the furniture, as the shutters slam from the sea breeze. A vivid memory still stenciled into her head came in 1976 when militiamen massacred Shiites, Druze and Palestinian refugees in the nearby former Karantina camp. A boy whose voice had not even broken kept pleading: 'Don't kill me.' They dragged him off to the corner of the street and shot him, she says. I can still hear his voice in my head, begging for his life, as they dragged him off. Two years later, in another of the multiple wars within a war which devastated Lebanon between 1975 and 1990, the Kataeb, a Christian militia, battled Syrian forces. The Syrians were parked right in front of our windows, and the Kataeb behind. They started fighting and we were caught right in the middle, she says. During the brief deployment of the Multinational Forces sent to oversee the Palestinian evacuation after Israel's invasion and supposedly to protect the refugees, they had new neighbors in the shape of American, French and Italian troops. They were all clean, except the Israelis. The Americans and the others used metal shacks and they would burn their waste, she says. We would be hanging the wash and they (Israeli troops) would be doing their dirty business or relieving themselves in full public view. We had to move away for a while, says a grimacing Yerganian. The Italians were friendly and we even learnt a few words of Italian. The Americans and the French would hand out chocolates to the neighborhood kids, she says. People would come from far to see them from our house. We had a lot of guests in those days. But things went sour yet again. President-elect BashirGemayel was assassinated and the radios tried to reassure the people and said he had survived the bomb blast, Makrouhie recalls. At midnight, we heard the marching of boots. We looked out of the window and saw the Jewish soldiers heading toward west Beirut, on the eve of the massacres in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila by allied Christian militiamen. Before the massacres, French soldiers had been posted with huge guns on the rooftops, including Yerganian's, to protect the evacuation of late Palestinian leader Arafat and his PLO fighters in 1982. In 1984, west Beirut fell to Muslim militias and the US and European troops withdrew through the port after their barracks were blown up by suicide bombers at a cost of some 300 lives. The Lebanese army posted heavy artillery outside the house to bombard the mostly Muslim western sector, opening up with 55-mm rounds that rocked the building to its very foundations. I was going mad, with pillows on each ear to muffle the horrific noise. I was going to go out and tell them to stop, please, please. My mother told me: 'Don't worry, this will pass too,' says Yerganian. Despite everything, I love Lebanon. I was born here and this is my country. Anything that happens to our poor Lebanon, it breaks our heart. We were so happy seeing the new bridges and the revival of the downtown, thanks to Hariri, after the civil war, but they won't allow us to have any joy, she says, referring to the 2005 murder of former premier and architect of Lebanon's revival, Rafiq Hariri. While the thousands of foreigners were fleeing the Israeli air strikes across from her window, at least we had hopes for a little calm in our area. But after the last US evacuations (on Wednesday), we fear the worst for Lebanon, she says.",Haro Chakmakjian,Armenian Reporter,2006-08-12,1
"A U.S.-funded opinion poll released this month paints an interesting, if contradictory, picture of the geopolitical preferences of Armenia's population. It shows that the vast majority of Armenians continue to support the close political and military ties with Russia maintained by their government. At the same, they regard the European Union as the most trustworthy international institution and would like their country to eventually join the bloc. Public support for Armenia's eventual accession to NATO likewise seems to be considerably stronger than it was in the past. The voter survey, commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development, was designed and conducted in early May by the Gallup Organization, the U.S. International Republican Institute, as well as the Armenian Sociological Association. Some 1,200 people randomly interviewed across Armenia were asked to weigh in on a wide range of issues mainly relating to domestic politics and economic development. It emerged that most of them feel the tiny South Caucasus state is on the wrong track, despite being optimistic about its future. The poll suggests that ordinary Armenians also want two seemingly irreconcilable things: continued alliance with Russia and integration into European and Euro-Atlantic structures. Eighty-six percent of respondents described Russia as Armenia's most important international partner, considering it, with varying degrees of conviction, to be a trustworthy ally. Not surprisingly, public support for the presence of a Russian military base on Armenian soil is still strong, with almost two-thirds of those polled saying that it has a positive impact on their country's independence and stability. Only 6% referred to Russia as an external threat. These figures reflect a traditionally strong pro-Russian sentiment in Armenia, where many people have for centuries looked to Moscow for protection against hostile Muslim neighbors. It has only been reinforced by Armenia's unresolved conflict with Azerbaijan over Karabagh and extremely strained relations with Turkey. Still, there are clear indications that this sentiment has been slowly but steadily eroding not least because of Moscow's hard bargaining in economic dealings with Yerevan and the Russian authorities' perceived reluctance to tackle racially motivated attacks on Armenian immigrants. Russia's waning influence in the South Caucasus and Armenia's increased contacts with the Council of Europe, the European Union, NATO, and the United States have also been a major factor. The USAID-funded poll offers more proof of this trend. It shows, in particular, that Armenians trust the EU more than their army and the ancient Armenian Apostolic Church. Armenian state institutions and political parties are trusted by barely one-third of the electorate. By contrast, 87% and 51% think well of the EU and NATO, respectively. Accordingly, 80% are in favor of Armenian membership in the EU. (Curiously, roughly as many respondents want Armenia to remain in the increasingly moribund Commonwealth of Independent States.) Public support for NATO membership is much weaker: only 40% said Armenia should definitely or probably join the U.S.-led alliance in the future, with another 45% less than enthusiastic about such a prospect. Yet the very fact of Armenian public opinion being essentially split down the middle on the issue marks quite a significant change from the not-so-distant past when the military alliance with Russia was hardly even questioned by Armenian policymakers and ordinary people alike. The change was exposed by other surveys conducted in the country in recent years. One such poll, conducted a year ago by the Armenian Center for National and International Studies (ACNIS), a private think tank, found that Armenians are evenly divided over NATO membership, with approximately 34% of them backing or opposing the idea and the remaining 32% undecided. According to another poll released by the Yerevan-based polling organization Vox Populi in October 2004, only 38% percent of the public thought that military cooperation with Russia should remain the bedrock of Armenian security policy. Earlier in 2004 ACNIS questioned 50 local political and public policy experts and found that two-thirds of them stand for Armenia's accession to NATO within the next decade. Most of those experts also felt that Moscow limits their country's independence. The apparent change in public mood has proceeded parallel to a deepening of Yerevan's cooperation with the EU, NATO, and the United States as part of what the administration of President Robert Kocharian calls a complementary foreign, policy. The Armenian government launched an individual partnership action plan (IPAP) with NATO last December and is currently negotiating with the EU on a plan of action stemming from its inclusion in the bloc's European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) program. Kocharian signaled his intention to accelerate Armenia's integration into Western structures on July 13 as he presided over a meeting of a high-level government commission tasked with coordinating the process. He instructed its members to come up with a timetable of concrete activities resulting from Yerevan's commitments to the Council of Europe, the EU, and NATO within the next two months. How far the Kocharian administration can go in trying to maintain equally close relations with Russia and the West has been a matter of contention in Armenia. Pro-Western opposition leaders and other government critics say Yerevan will sooner or later have to make a clear strategic choice in favor of one of the parties to the ongoing geopolitical game in the region. But as the latest poll suggests, most Armenians share the complementarity of their rulers.

"Friday, July 28, 2006 Dear Friends, On my original schedule for today, the annual staff picnic of Haigazian University was to take place. Now, I am simply grateful that most members of our staff could come to work and perform their tasks, albeit with minimal efficiency. We still have no idea when it will be possible to resume the Summer Session and whether the Fall 2006-2007 Semester will start on time. Throughout the country, aid work in support of the refugees has been better organized now than it was in the past weeks, including the small efforts of the Armenian Evangelical Church. Prayer groups have been organized in and around churches, including a daily time of prayer for the Haigazian community. Denominational and regional barriers among the people working for and with each other have thankfully dropped to a minimum. Bombing has continued in the past days but focusing mainly on the South and the Bakaa. Cars, trucks, communication centers and neighborhoods have been occasionally targeted. The number of the civilian victims in Lebanon has exceeded 500. The bombing of the Jiyyeh power plant, which served Southern Lebanon, has resulted in a 15,000-ton oil spill in the Mediterranean Sea, causing a major environmental disaster. The fear of the spread of skin and other infectious diseases has invited the attention of health-care workers and volunteers in the extremely crowded refugee centers all around. Despite all this, some parts of the country have enjoyed relatively quiet days, thus allowing many to conduct the necessary duties or report to work. Lebanon has been a resourceful country in many senses, and it continues to be so even in hard times. In general, life in Lebanon has become, once more and hopefully only for a few weeks, a competition between emergency and normalcy. It has been seventeen days, and we still wonder what this war is all about. It has certainly not accomplished the aims listed two weeks ago. On the contrary, this infamous round of violence has so far resulted in: *Hundreds of deaths and thousands of injuries; *More than 2 billion dollars of damage to the infrastructure of this small country; *A huge and ongoing loss of investments and business opportunities for every family, every town, and every company; *Up to 800,000 displaced people in a country of 4 million, thousands of whom will have no home to return to; *Major damage to the environment; *Long-term damage to the reputation of Lebanon; *Loss of trust in the young Lebanese generation for a safe future in the Middle East; *Emotional and stress-related problems in families; *Most dangerously of all, this war has created a shift of the Lebanese, Middle Eastern, and generally Muslim political center, wherever it existed, to radical positions. The centrists have found their arguments to be obsolete and unattractive, while the radicals have found their fundamentalist reading of the enemy and the world to be both attractive and justified. I am sad to notice that the current war on Lebanon has hindered the general movement of the Lebanese youth towards democracy. Still, we are full of hope. Yes. The task of reconciliation, the challenge of looking analytically at issues, our duty to be interpreters of the Western and Eastern worlds to each other, and the possibility for the youth to look at matters from a wide perspective will be very difficult. But as long as we, as Armenian and non-Armenian churches in the Middle East, have opportunities to work, minister, teach, and serve, we can believe in beneficial change. As long as we have faith in a God who leads, inspires and empowers us, and as long as we can create, recreate and preserve the communities of faith as genuine resources of our ministry, we will have reasons to remain thankful and engaged. Many of us have been repeating in the past days that the people of Lebanon will overcome this crisis too. We repeat this not out of ignorance of what is said and written about the future. As Christians, our hope should also be a plan, an intention, and an action. Faith is to be put to work. Your accompaniment of our communities has meant much in the past weeks. Continue to pray with us for peace in our community as well as yours. Beirut, Lebanon",Anonymous,Armenian Reporter,2006-08-05,1
"I have occasionally written about dangers that I perceive from Saudi Arabia, and that the Saudis are not friends of Armenia. One would not be remiss to state that the Saudi government, given its brand of Islam, can hardly be friends with any non-Islamic state. But given the U.S. enslavement to crude, it is no surprise that many in the U.S., led by the President's family, insist that the House of Khalid is a good friend. Take away the money that the Saudis have made and continue to make, and let us see how deep the friendship is. Armenians looking back to 1915 have heard or read somewhere that the Arabs took in thousands of survivors of the Genocide. As I have previously written, this may be true, but Arabs and the Saudis are not necessarily the same. Even as I write, the Saudi Arabian government supports Azerbaijan against Armenian claims to Karabagh. Further, Saudi money helped the unfortunate Azeris who suffered from the war, but no Saudi money officially flowed in to help the Armenians in need. Where were the Saudis in the winter of 1992 when Armenian citizens were burning what wood was left on park benches to stay warm? To this day, Saudi Arabia has no embassy in Armenia. Further, I seriously doubt that, in my lifetime, the Saudi Arabian government will look kindly on any Christian nation. Actually, on any nation that does not adhere to strict tenets of Islamic law as Saudi mullahs design. This is not paranoia or a sudden frenzy about Islam. Consider the comprehensive research conducted by the nonprofit organization, Freedom House. What they did was examine Saudi books used in their schools to see if anything was written about non-Muslims during the formative years of the future leaders of the Saudi world. During the research, the Saudi government announced that reforms were completed to make the schools' texts teach a more tolerant acceptance of peoples of other faiths. They outright lied. As a general comment, the researchers discovered that Islamic studies in Saudi schools encourage violence and hatred toward infidels. Brainwashing starts in the first grade and grows every year through the 12th grade. The youth are taught that they must wage jihad against the nonbelievers and that it is their duty to spread the faith. From what happened on September 11, 2001, I do not buy that jihad is only a nonviolent version of a question of faith. It is no accident that there were 15 Saudis who crashed planes into the World Trade Center towers. In the first grade, classes begin by teaching young minds that every religion other than Islam is false. This sentiment perhaps can be likened to the Christian faith, which teaches that Christianity is the only means of being saved. It is not hard to comprehend that all religions wish to ensure that their followers think that their unique faith is the correct one. There is real danger if tolerance of other faiths is also preached. However, the similarities end at this point, and it's where hate becomes an integral part of the Saudi curriculum. In the fourth grade, the Saudi schools' texts read, True belief means that you hate the polytheists and infidels but do not treat them unjustly. Perhaps it is possible in some cases, but can hate and the application of justice go hand in glove? Now let us consider how unfortunate it is that Saudi Arabia does not have an embassy in Armenia. A true believer, and that is what every Saudi embassy person would be, is taught in the fifth grade that it is forbidden for a Muslim to be a loyal friend to someone who does not believe in God and His Prophet. I suppose one could argue that embassy personnel do not have to be friends with Armenians. But it certainly does not add confidence that a non-friend's word could be believed. Perhaps the greatest hatred in the schools is reserved for the Jews. In the sixth grade, Saudi children are taught, Just as Muslims were successful in the past when they came together in a sincere endeavor to evict Christian crusaders from Palestine, so will the Arabs and Muslims emerge victorious, God willing, against the Jews and their allies if they stand together and fight a true jihad for God, for this is within God's power. This hatred is not even limited in scope to Israel. It is hatred against all Jews, for surely the Saudis know the difference between Israel and a Jew. The following instruction to eighth graders is even more revealing, as hatred of not only Jews but of Christians as well: The apes are the Jews, the people of the Sabbath; while the swine are the Christians, the infidels of the communion of Jesus. Since Armenians were the first state to declare Christianity its state religion, there also must be special hatred reserved for Armenians. In the ninth grade, the Saudi youngsters are taught, The clash between this (Muslim) community and the Jews and Christians has endured, and it will continue as long as God wills. The ninth graders are taught a special calling. The clash between Muslims and Jews and Christians is not man induced. The hatred is not from man's doing but it is a calling from God in that the clash will continue as long as God wills. Thus it should be no surprise to anyone that 15 of the suicide bombers that attacked the U.S. were Saudis. Nor should it surprise anyone that the number-one nationality populating the prison at Guantanamo Bay is Saudis. Recently, it has also been discovered that the majority of foreign jihadists attacking American troops in Iraq have been Saudis. It is time to wake up. The al-Qaeda killer recently convicted of attempting to murder George W. Bush is an alumnus of a Saudi academy on the outskirts of Washington, D.C. that uses the same texts. In 2004, King Abdullah committed himself to reforming these extremist curricula with the removal of hatred directed at Christians and Jews. The man he appointed as Education Minister to see the changes through was Abdullah Al-Obeid. The latter headed, at the time, the terror-associated Muslim World League, which once functioned as a charitable front for al-Qaeda. The U.S. intelligence agencies know all of this. In fact, the Freedom House made it public knowledge. Yet, Saudi Arabia will be allowed to send 21,000 students over the course of the next four years to the U.S., a country they have been taught in their fledgling years to hate. Imagine if just one half of one percent of these students, or 105 of them, are radical Islamists. A new crop of possible terrorists may have been allowed inside the U.S. borders. And yet, we are going to construct a 2000-mile wall along the Mexican border to keep out people who are seeking work to take care of their families. Why should terrorists sneak in across the southern borders of the U.S. when they can probably walk in with books in hand through the air- conditioned airports as Saudi students? Good thing Saudi Arabia is not on Armenia's border and that Armenia is much too small to gain Saudi attention.

"Once again, the Middle East is aflame with lamentable confrontations and wars. What started with the totally unacceptable and illegal kidnapping of Israeli soldiers has now turned into an assault against two peoples - Palestinian and Lebanese - who are being collectively punished with excessive and disproportionate force. We Armenians have a long history in the Middle East - not least in Lebanon and the Holy Land where the Armenian Catholicosate of Cilicia in Amelias and the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem have pursued their Christian ministry and witness for centuries. We recall how we were welcomed with kindness and hospitality by the indigenous Christian and Muslim populations of both those lands after our forefathers tied Ottoman Turkey as a result of the Armenian Genocide during World War I. We believe firmly that the fight against terrorism is an indispensable one in our world today since any such terrorism is contrary to our Christian understanding of peace, justice and reconciliation. However, we also consider it alarming when the challenge against terrorism is done at the expense of peaceful peoples and nations. Today, we stand firmly with all those who are suffering as a consequence of the tragedies befalling those ancient biblical lands and civilisations. Innocent Palestinian, Israeli and Lebanese children, women and men are now losing their lives, becoming wounded, orphaned, homeless or displaced because the international community has lost its moral compass and has shifted away from peaceful negotiations toward the indiscriminate use of force as a tool for resolving conflicts. Besides, it has refused to address the root causes of the tragedies of the Middle East - preferring instead redundant piecemeal approaches that are inconsistent with peace, justice and hope. Throughout this whole week, starting with our Sunday Divine Liturgy, the Armenian Church in Great Britain and its community-wide faithful will pray for all our Christian communities in the Holy Land and Lebanon who are suffering from the current situation. We pray for peace in the whole region, as we urge for an immediate cease-fire that would show good will and good faith, in the hope that less bellicose minds would prevail to rescue the region from further confrontation. In so doing, we fall back upon our faith-based beliefs and remember the psalmist who exhorts us to commit ourselves to work for peace with justice. After all, the biblical picture is one of justice and peace kissing each other (Ps 85:10), and we remind all panics that there can be no peace without justice.

"WASHINGTON - U.S. Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas), chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Commission, on July 14 praised the passage of Senate Resolution 500, which urges the Russian Federation to fully protect the freedom of all domestic religious communities, both registered and unregistered. While we recognize that religious freedom has advanced significantly for the Russian people since the collapse of the Soviet Union, said Sen. Brownback, I am concerned by sporadic yet consistent reports of local government harassment and uninvestigated assaults against religious groups. The passage of this resolution sends a clear message to the Russian leadership that more work is needed to fully protect the fundamental rights of individuals in Russia to profess and practice their faith, said Sen. Brownback, adding that, the United States will continue to engage the Russian authorities on this issue. The resolution, which was sponsored by Sen. Brownback and attracted bipartisan support, calls for the United States to urge the Russian Federation to ensure full protection of freedoms for all religious communities, and for the Council of Europe members and Group of Eight members to raise these concerns with President Putin. A similar resolution sponsored by Helsinki Commission Co-Chair Rep. Christopher H. Smith (R-N.J.) passed on March 15. The Helsinki Commission highlighted the growing problem of religious liberty violations in Russia at an April 14, 2005, hearing titled Unregistered Religious Groups in Russia. In addition to harassment against some Christian groups and other minority religious communities, two disturbing trends highlighted in the resolution are the rise of anti-Semitism within certain segments of Russian society, as well as increases in the severity and frequency of oppressive actions taken by both local and federal officials against Muslim communities within the country. The Russian government has recently enacted legislation potentially curtailing religious freedoms. The January law regulating non-commercial organizations gives authorities the ability to attend meetings of any registered religious community, as well as increased control over foreign donations. The Senate resolution calls on the Russian government to invite Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) representatives and the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief to visit and discuss concerns regarding religious freedom.",Anonymous,Ukrainian Weekly,2006-07-23,1

President Lech Kaczynski met with Israeli Ambassador David Peleg to address concerns over the coalition with the League of Polish Families, a nationalist and Catholic party with the radical, right-wing All-Polish Youth group. Mr. Kaczynski guaranteed that there is no space for anti-Semitism in Poland, Andrzcj Krawczyk, the president's undersecretary of state, told The Associated Press. All-Polish Youth members have been known to make Nazi salutes and chant Sieg Heil during street protests. The group also has attacked gay and women's rights marches in past years. Kaczynski assured Peleg that he, his office and his governing Law and Justice party were guarantees that anti-Semitism in Poland has no chance, the presidential office said in a statement. POPE JOHN PAUL II, A PATRON SAINT FOR ACTORS? The chairman of Italy's National Theatre Agency, Giuseppe Ferrazza, told the Catholic TV channel Telepace, Theatre needs a protector because it has become too atheist. He and other Italian theater actors say that they would like Pope John Paul II to be named their patron. As a young man, Karol Wojtyla was an amateur actor and wrote poetry and dramatic works for the theater. His biographers agree that his theatrical experience helped make him one of the best communicators in the world. Meanwhile the cause for the late pontiff's beatification continues. On his recent visit to the former pope's birthplace Wadowice, Pope Benedict XVI predicted that process would result in Pope John Paul II's canonization before too long. The sudden recovery from Parkinson's disease of a French nun is being investigated as a possible miracle, which would be the divine verification of the late pope's holiness. JEWS, CATHOLICS PLAN FRIENDSHIP MEMORIAL. Poland's Catholic church has agreed to turn the house where the late Pope John Paul II was born into a memorial of the Jewish-Catholic friendship. During his four-day stay in Poland, the German-born Pope Benedict XVI paid a brief stop in Wadowice, the birthplace of his predecessor and mentor John Paul II, to enter and bless the house, the Washington Post reported. Some 20 years ago the house was turned into a museum. About 200,000 pilgrims from Poland and around the world annually visit the site, containing memorabilia of the late pope, whom his countrymen praise as our greatest Pole. HAPPY ANNIVERSARY TO...

"ABHaber, Belgium, June 15 (EU-Turkey News network) - Turks see the presence of US troops in Iraq as a greater threat to Mideast stability than the government in Iran and its nuke ambitions, according to Pew Research Center's poll of European and Muslim countries. Turkish support for war in Iraq dropped sharply from 33 percent in 2002 to 12 percent this year, while 61 percent oppose Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons. At 3 percent, Turkey now registers the lowest level of confidence in President Bush. As divisions between the West and Muslim nations in opinions of Hamas' victory are wider, 44 percent of Turks see Hamas' victory as good for the Palestinian people while 23 percent think the opposite. Significant part of opinion poll shows that negative views of France have risen over past year, especially in Muslim-populated countries. In Turkey, 61 percent feel unfavorably toward France, up from 51 percent last year The majority of Turks see the presence of U.S. troops in Iraq as a greater threat to stability in the Mideast than the controversial government in Iran, according to a new poll of European and Muslim countries. The Pew Research Center's opinion poll released this week found that Turks are increasingly turning away from the U.S.-declared war on terror. More than three-quarters of Turks (77 percent) oppose the U.S.-led war on terror, up from 56 percent in 2004, while 61 percent of the participants oppose Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons. Turkish support for the war in Iraq dropped sharply from 33 percent in 2002, the beginning of the war, to 12 percent as of 2006. People in Britain, France, Germany, Spain and Russia also rated America's continuing involvement in Iraq a worse problem than Iran and its nuclear ambitions. Views of U.S. troops in Iraq were even more negative in countries like Indonesia, Egypt, Jordan, and Pakistan. But the war in Iraq trumps the Iranian situation as a perceived danger to the world at a time when the image of the U.S. and its war on terrorism continues to drop internationally. Even in Britain, the U.S.'s closest ally in Iraq, 41 percent of those surveyed said the U.S. military presence in Iraq was a danger to world peace and only 34 percent described the Iranian government as a danger. International opinion on the future of Iraq is generally gloomy. Majorities in most countries surveyed believe that efforts to establish a stable democratic government in Iraq will ultimately fail. Pessimism is strongest in Spain, Turkey, Germany, Jordan, and Egypt - in all five countries, more than six in 10 respondents believe efforts to establish democracy will definitely or probably fail. Iraq is one of many issues that push a negative view of the U.S., said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center. Last year we saw some good news in countries like Russia and India, Kohut said. That good news being wiped away is a measure of how difficult a problem this is for the U.S. Western countries share some points of view, Kohut said, noting mutual concerns about Iran's development of a nuclear program and the victory of Hamas in Palestinian elections. But Iraq continues to be divisive. The opinion on Bush has continued to decline in European countries, while Muslim-populated publics remain strongly opposed to the American president. At 3 percent, Turkey now registers the lowest level of confidence in President Bush. Western European nations and predominantly Muslim nations have sharply different views on Iran, which the U.S. claims is developing nuclear weapons. Concerning majority Muslim-populated countries' position towards Iran's acquiring nuclear weapons, solid majorities in Turkey (61 percent) and Indonesia (59 percent) oppose it, but people in Egypt and Jordan are divided, and most Pakistanis (52 percent) favor Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. In addition, more people in major industrialized nations than in Muslim-populated countries believe that Iran wants a nuclear program to develop weapons, not nuclear energy. West-Muslim Divide on Hamas Victory Divisions between the West and the Muslim world in opinions of the Hamas Party's victory in Palestine's January elections are even wider. Fully 71 percent of Germans and 69 percent of the French feel the Hamas triumph will be bad for the Palestinian people, among those who are aware of the issue. Somewhat fewer Americans (50 percent) express this view, although just 20 percent think the Hamas triumph will be a good thing for the Palestinians. Among major U.S. allies, only the British are divided on Hamas' election - 34 percent say it will be bad, while 32 percent take a positive view. By contrast, large majorities in Pakistan (87 percent), Egypt (76 percent), Jordan (68 percent), and Indonesia (61 percent) feel that the Hamas Party victory will be good for the Palestinian people, among those who had heard about the election. In addition, the Muslim-populated publics surveyed generally feel the Hamas triumph will increase chances of a fair settlement of the Middle East conflict, a view opposed by the West. Some 44 percent of Turks meanwhile think that Hamas' victory is good for the Palestinian people, while 23 percent think the opposite. Another significant part of the opinion poll shows that negative views of France have increased over the past year, especially in majority Muslim-populated countries. In Turkey, 61 percent feel unfavorably toward France, up from 51 percent last year. Riots of disenfranchised Muslim French youth have likely fueled this perception worldwide, whereas for Turks, French legislation proposing that rejection of the Armenian genocide be outlawed may also have played a role.",Anonymous,Armenian Reporter,2006-07-01,1
"Genocide Is Here and Now It is a crime according to international law. So why does the West - and, above all, the United States - take so long to react to genocide? If at all A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, by Samantha Power. Harper Collins, $14.49, 629 pp. In the summer of 1993, at the height of the Serbian siege on Sarajevo, Bosnia's Muslim President, Alija Izetbegovic, came to Washington, D.C. to request American support for the lifting of the siege. All he heard from the U.S. administration, however, were words of encouragement and sympathy. Hoping to bring his people's predicament to the awareness of the public, he met with several groups of scholars and reporters. At one of these meetings, held in a Washington research institute, Izetbegovic tried to explain why he could not enlist more massive support for his cause from the U.S. administration. We, the Bosnians, are without any kin in the world. What would have happened, for example, if we had been Nordic Protestants? The Scandinavian countries would surely have come to our aid; perhaps they would even have provided military assistance to their persecuted brethren. It's even possible that U.S. senators from Minnesota and Wisconsin, states in which there are many descendants of Scandinavian immigrants, would have lobbied the administration for military action. But we are all alone. Aware that many of the people present were Jewish (Jews had been more vocal than other groups in calling for aid to Muslim Bosnians), he added with a faint laugh: And if we had five million Muslim Bosnians in the U.S., the American administration would certainly treat us very differently. Izetbegovic was inadvertently raising one of the difficult questions standing at the center of Samantha Power's book: Why did the United States, despite all the moralizing rhetoric of its foreign policy, refrain from taking every possible action to prevent the phenomenon of genocide throughout the 20th century? Given that the U.S. and the rest of the international community have failed to act against the genocide that has been perpetrated for more than two years in Darfur, Sudan, the significance of the question is not merely historical. Power is a professor of political science at Harvard University and head of the center for human rights at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. However, she began her career as a journalist, covering the fighting in the former Yugoslavia for the Washington Post and other newspapers. To her academic analyses she therefore adds practical experience in the field, giving a dimension of realism and moral validity to a debate, which, in the hands of experts in international law, might have become a scholastic exercise, a matter of barren legal quibbling. The book examines some of the most traumatic events of the 20th century: the Armenian massacres in Turkey, the Holocaust, Cambodia, the anti-Kurd campaign in Iraq, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo. In each of these chapters, Power presents the basic facts and follows the response, or lack thereof, of the U.S. administration. All this, while showing tremendous historical awareness of America's transformation in the course of the century from a marginal player in the international system to the leading, and ultimately only, superpower in the world. At the same time, Power also describes the development of international legislation and the crystallization of the concept of genocide, reflected in the 1948 international Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide - a convention the United States did not ratify until 1988. It was this document that coined the term genocide and made it a crime according to international law. A central player in this account is the man who formulated the concept of genocide and contributed more than any other individual to the drafting of the convention: Professor Raphael Lemkin, a Jewish refugee from Poland, who came to the U.S. during World War II and considered it his life's mission to create a new international norm. What fueled Lemkin's commitment, even before World War II, was the Armenian Holocaust, of which he became aware after a young Armenian man in Berlin in 1921 murdered Talaat Pasha, who was the Ottoman interior minister during World War I and the primary culprit in the Armenian massacre. Only after the Holocaust and the murder of the Jews did more people begin to listen to Lemkin, and the UN then adopted the convention that he had to a large extent drafted. It is unfortunate that his name is virtually unknown in Israel, even though it is clear that, without his persistence and moral conviction, the concept of genocide would not have become part of international law. Power, however, does not stop there: She also traces the enormous gap that remains, even after the passing of the genocide convention, between the level of theory and declarations and the actual willingness to use force in order to end genocidal acts. Power's main argument, which won her book widespread acclaim and resonance, is that there is no truth to the claim that genocide was, in most cases, not known to have happened until after the fact, and therefore could not have been stopped. The problem, she argues, is not a lack of information, but rather a lack of willingness - for internal political reasons - to become involved in a matter carrying no political benefits, despite the clear moral issue at stake. In a sentence that, more than any other, sums up her book, Power claims that no U.S. president has ever suffered politically for his indifference to [genocide's] occurrence. A harsh, brutal claim, and one whose truthfulness the entire book sets out to prove. Power begins with the Armenian holocaust: Already in January 1915, she shows, the New York Times reported Talaat's declaration that there was no room for Christians in the Ottoman Empire, and that he advised them to leave the country. In Power's account of the warnings conveyed to Washington, the central figure is the U.S. ambassador to Constantinople, Henry Morgenthau Sr. (grandfather of Barbara Tuchman). A German-born Jew who was a political appointee of President Woodrow Wilson, Morgenthau felt free to convey reports and express positions of which professional diplomats steered clear. Power shows that when reports first came of the deportation measures taken against the Armenians, Morgenthau inundated the State Department with cables warning of a systematic plan to crush the Armenian race. His superiors in Washington, D.C. did not approve of his emotional language. They were even less pleased with the protests he submitted to the authorities at Constantinople: On one occasion, Talaat responded by asking: Why are you so interested in the Armenians anyway? You are a Jew, these people are Christians.... What have you to complain of? The reports did impress and appall former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt; he proposed to President Wilson that the United States, then still a neutral party, threaten to wage war on Turkey if the genocide did not stop. The official American position, however, remained that this was an internal Turkish matter, and Wilson was, at the time, still determined to keep his country out of the war. It did not help that Roosevelt was viewed as trigger-happy back from the days of his involvement in the 1898 war on Spain, or that he was Wilson's political rival. And so, even though the United States had comprehensive information - in part through the six American consuls stationed across the empire - it did not lift a finger. The subject of the U.S. attitude toward the Nazi persecution and subsequent extermination of the Jews is well known. Power repeatedly stresses that, during the 1930s, the U.S. turned a blind eye to the Nazis' anti-Semitic policies in Germany and Austria, and that when reports of the systematic annihilation arrived during the war, every effort was made to downplay them. Even when the scope of the extermination became well known, no practical steps were taken - beyond issuing declarations - to bring it to an end. Holocaust scholars are well aware of all this, but Power presents the case in a comprehensive historical and theoretical context. The other cases on which the book focuses involve the massacre of the Kurds by Saddam Hussein, the murder of the Tutsis by the Hutu government in Rwanda, and the Serbian policy - first against the Muslim Bosnians, then against the Albanians in Kosovo. Here we are dealing with a period in which the rhetoric of all American presidents was clearly shaped by awareness of the Holocaust: The author quotes impressive (and embarrassing) verbal pledges by all of the U.S. presidents (Carter, Reagan, Bush Sr., Clinton), who repeat the cliché of never again over and over, but when the need to step in actually arises, hide behind wordplay and diplomatic attempts that are powerless to stop the machinery of extermination. Over and over we learn that the authorities had the information, which was also conveyed by the press to the public at large. Power's documentation is troubling: She shows, for example, that investigators working on behalf of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led by Peter Galbraith (later U.S. ambassador to Croatia), visited Iraqi Kurdistan and collected unequivocal documentation of mass murders and deportations. Influenced by these documents, the Senate committee drafted a 1988 bill to cut off the agricultural credit given to Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The legislative initiative, however, was thwarted through the joint efforts of the White House, the State Department and the agricultural lobby; meanwhile, the killing of Kurds continued. Power shows that no one in official Washington could have pled ignorance, although they all eventually found one excuse or another to hide behind. The same happened in Rwanda, in Bosnia and in Kosovo. As Power shows, what finally caused the U.S. to intervene in Bosnia - after the horrifying Srebrenica massacre, when the Serbs murdered 8,000 Muslim men and boys in a UN-controlled area - were internal pressures that put President Clinton in a serious bind. Among those who pushed for severe measures to be taken against Milosevic - there and in Kosovo - were Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Assistant Secretary Richard Holbrooke, and the commander of the NATO forces in Europe, General Wesley Clark. One cannot help but notice that all three are Jewish or of Jewish origin - and the fact that this case involved defending Muslims says something about Jewish sensitivities, which in this case were actually universal. Now we might return to the words of President Izetbegovic: The question is not how much the American leaders know, but what political situation they find themselves in. If the victims of genocide do not have an internal American political lobby, their cry for help is not likely to be heard. The same is true of the current situation in Darfur: Secretary of State Colin Powell did mention the word genocide in one of his speeches, but the Bush administration has been very careful not to repeat it, so that it will not be expected to demonstrate the commitment to direct military action called for by the anti-genocide convention. On the other hand, the African-American lobby in the U.S. is too weak or lacking in solidarity to turn the murder of black people by Arab militias in Darfur into a mass political campaign. Clearly, America's current entanglement in Iraq will only reduce its willingness to become involved in the foreseeable future, and this for reasons that are wrong, but which can be understood on political grounds. Matters become even more complicated since the Democrats, usually more sensitive to humanitarian issues, are not likely to pressure a Republican president they despise as much as Bush to lead America into yet another military involvement. Either way, the questions raised by Power's troubling book - whether the lack of involvement is primarily a function of domestic policy, and how a political lobby not based on ethnic identification might be created to advance commitment to the principle of humanitarian intervention - are left unanswered.

"Caroline Finkel's Book on Ottoman History: Osman's Dream The Ottoman Empire: Bridge across the Bosporus More than 80 years after being supplanted by the Turkish republic, the Ottoman empire will not die. Bloodshed in the Balkans; Arab and Kurdish nationalism across the Middle East; Turcophobia in Armenia; all are echoes of a dynasty that survived for 600 years and whose dominions extended from the Danube through the Levant to Algiers. Few historians have dared compress the story of this extraordinary enterprise into a single volume. Osman's Dream shows why. Osman led one of several Turcoman tribes, of Central Asian descent, that were competing for control of Anatolia at the beginning of the 14' century. (The dream in question was interpreted to mean that Osman would found an imperial house; 'Ottoman is the European corruption of his name). By the mid- 16th century, Osman's descendants had killed off the Byzantine Empire and turned its capital, Constantinople (renamed Istanbul), into the world's greatest mosque city. They also had control of the Muslim holy places, Mecca and Medina, in Arabia. The empire's expansion was driven, in part, by Islamic notions of a just war against the infidel, but the Ottomans were also notable for their relative tolerance. Jews fleeing the Spanish inquisition were welcomed to Istanbul. Christian converts became key figures in the bureaucracy, armed forces and the harem. Even at the empire's peak, however, the tide of history was turning in Europe's favor. Challenged by the Europeans' intellectual and military prowess, hampered by the fiscal ineptitude of its leaders, and powerless to suppress the petty nationalisms that infected its Balkan possessions, the empire began to unravel - at times abruptly, at others imperceptibly. With her doctorate in the fiendishly complex discipline of Ottoman studies, Ms. Finkel is ideally placed to make sense of this. But Osman's Dream leaves one with the impression that the author's scholarship - she includes a 30-page bibliography - could have been put to better use. Her apparent desire to record every event of significance sometimes results in a dispiriting succession of military campaigns and diplomatic intrigues; one would have preferred a pruning of the thicket of events and more discussion of what it all means. The author offers glimpses of a more satisfying book. She includes a suggestive aside on the blending of French and Persian inspirations in the Ottoman palace-building of the early 18th century - as good an emblem for the empire's strained multiculturalism as you could wish for. There are tantalizing allusions to both the fascination and the repulsion, which animated the later Ottomans' ambivalence towards Europe. And one wishes that Ms. Finkel had developed her intriguing defense of the empire in the 19th century, multi-confessional, geographically incoherent and economically backward, in the face of demands, on the part of impertinent Europeans, that it reform internally. The limitations of Ms Finkel's approach are most apparent in her perfunctory treatment of the empire's final, tumultuous years. She deals no more than cursorily with the Armenian massacres during the First World War, preferring to observe that scholarship has suffered from the highly charged contemporary dispute over whether the killings constitute genocide. This point would have made a worthwhile footnote. As a substitute for an account of what happened, it is a cop-out.

"LOS ANGELES, CA - The following is the text of the editorial, entitled It Was Genocide, which appeared in the March 22, 2006 issue of the Los Angeles Times. John Evans is the U.S. ambassador to Armenia, as of this writing. But he probably won't be for long. Evans, a career diplomat who was selected to receive an American Foreign Service Assn. award last year for his frank public speaking, irked his superiors at the State Department by uttering the following words at UC Berkeley in February 2005: I will today call it the Armenian genocide. For that bit of truth-telling, Evans was forced to issue a clarification, then a correction, then to endure having his award rescinded under pressure from his bosses, and finally to face losing his job altogether. What happened in Armenia in 1915 is well known. The Ottoman Empire attempted to exterminate the Armenian population through slaughter and mass deportation. It finished half the job, killing about 1.2 million people. Yet the State Department has long avoided the word genocide, not out of any dispute over history but out of deference to Turkey, whose membership in NATO and location between Europe and Asia make it a strategic ally. It is time to stop tiptoeing around this issue and to accept settled history. Genocide, according to accepted U.N. definition, means the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. Armenia is not even a borderline case. Punishing an ambassador for speaking honestly about a 90-year-old crime befits a cynical, double-dealing monarchy, not the leader of the free world. Turks point out that their Ottoman ancestors considered it treason to side with Russia at the outbreak of World War I, as many Armenians did. But the massacres were also fueled by Muslim animosity toward a Christian minority. When then-U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire Henry Morgenthau protested the bloodletting, he received a telling response from Mehmed Talaat, the interior minister in charge of the anti-Armenian campaign. Why are you so interested in Armenians anyway? You are a Jew, these people are Christians, Talaat said. Why can't you let us do with these Christians as we please? For Armenians who escaped the killing and came to this country, inadequate recognition of their history is crazy-making. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), whose district includes the heart of the Armenian diaspora, keeps introducing a bill to officially recognize the genocide, only to see congressional leadership quash it each year, under pressure from the State Department. Some nations, thankfully, are stepping where Congress fears to tread. The European Parliament last year passed a non-binding resolution asking that Turkey acknowledge the genocide as a precondition for joining the European Union. The Turkish government, typically, was infuriated, yet it still desperately wants to join the EU. One day, the country that was founded as a direct repudiation of its Ottoman past will face its history squarely, as part of a long-overdue maturing process. Some day before then, we hope, the State Department will too.",Anonymous,Armenian Reporter International,2006-03-25,1
"A few years ago I went searching through family artifacts contained in a wooden chest crafted by my father, Hovhannes Garabedian, who, as a youth, had apprenticed as a carpenter in Perchenj [Parchanj], a village in Kharpert. I was looking for my father's memoirs, which he had composed shortly before and after immigrating to the United States in December 1920. Unbeknownst to me, my daughter, Andrea Karanian had turned my father's meticulously penned writings over to our good friend and Armenian scholar Nicholas Soghomonian, who painstakingly translated and produced an English version, which Andrea then presented to me at Christmas. I subsequently made and shared copies with my family members so that our grandchildren, in particular, would have some relevant information about one of their great greatgrandparents. Included in his memoirs was a section dealing with his experience as a volunteer (Gamavor) fighting against Turkish forces in and around Palestine. He was an Armenian legionnaire in the Battle of Arara, which was fought on September 19, 1918. The following is a portion of his memoirs. - Haige J. Garabedian I was born in the village of Perchenj (District of Kharpert, Armenia) on August 28, 1891. I left my birthplace on March 30, 1912 and arrived in the US on May 25, 1912. On June 30, 1917, I volunteered and joined the Armenian Legion to serve and protect the interest of the Armenian nation to the best of my ability. A few months later, we Legionnaires left for France and, on August 12, 1917, we were dispatched to Cyprus. After 10 months of intensive military training in Cyprus, we left for Ismalia, via Port Said (Egypt), to face the murderer of the Armenian nation (the Turks). We found the enemy in a well-prepared and fortified position. The Turks had concentrated about 100,000 troops and 70,000 camels to cross the Suez Canal and capture Egypt. Fortunately, the military intelligence of the Allies (French and British) had detected this concentration of troops right on time and, by cannon fire from their battleships, destroyed the enemy's military strength. When we arrived at Mejidel (a small town inhabited by Muslim Arabs), which was captured by the British three months before our arrival, we were told that, the following day, July 14, the National Independence Day of France, would be celebrated. The Armenian Legion also participated in the festivities; infantry was on the first line, followed next by the cavalry and then the artillerymen. After marching about 30 minutes, we arrived at the headquarters, where we were welcomed by the Allied High Command (French and British officers). After four hours of parading, picture taking and cannon fire, we returned to our barracks in a jubilant and triumphant mood. On August 1, 1918, a general military exercise was performed under the command of a British general for a night attack. The Armenian Legion was divided into two groups - the enemy, which was hidden behind a hill, and our group with all sorts of armament, which was placed under maximum alert for the attack. At midnight, with the help of intensive searchlights, we spotted the enemy's location, surrounded them and, with a swift and surprise attack, captured them as prisoners of war. On August 23, we left Mejidel and, with a 70-pound load on our backs, started marching towards a Turkish position to face the enemy. It took us seven days (marching ten hours daily) to reach our destination - the second line of Turkish fortifications. On September 18, we descended into our fortified trenches and waited for nightfall. At 3:30 a.m. the offensive began. Each commander, with his troops, followed the front-line detectives (intelligence officers) and moved towards the enemy trenches atop the mountain where they had placed their machine guns. Under the heavy burden of ammunition and provisions, we moved down the valley. Then, with the utmost caution, we went up the mountain from three different positions (directions) to encircle the enemy. As we got closer, the enemy detected our approach and opened concentrated machine gun tire at our positions. A few minutes later, our artillery, wisely placed a mile in the rear, responded with cannon fire. In response to this, enemy cannons started rumbling; all sounded like a horrible clash of firepower, as if heaven and earth had collided in the darkness of the night. But, for us (Armenian Legionnaires), it was more like a wedding party; we were filled with a profound feeling of revenge against the Turks - each one of us had become a wild lion looking for prey. Perfectly armed, bayonets firmly attached at the end of our rifles, we never felt any fear. Our primary objective was to settle accounts with the enemy for the Armenian Genocide and bring to justice as many Turks as possible. As the enemy machine-gun fire was showering down upon us like early spring hail, we moved forward without hesitation and fear. Under extremely difficult conditions, suspended between life and death for so many times, at last, we got to the top of the mountain and, with a final charge, captured the enemy fortifications, causing countless casualties and taking 28,000 prisoners of war. During the main battle that lasted about 30 hours, our casualties amounted to 24 killed and 75 wounded. After this successful military operation, we were ordered to lay down our arms and take a temporary rest. In the darkness of the night, we started moving down the mountain towards the valley, where some of the enemy had regrouped, presumably, for a counteroffensive. The same night, from 11 p.m. to 12 a.m., I was given the front-line guard duty to monitor enemy movements. About 20 minutes after assuming responsibility, I heard a distant noise that was gradually coming closer. I listened carefully but failed to understand anything from the Arabic conversation that I heard. Immediately, I dispatched word to headquarters to check, to find out what was going on and to report to the high command. Our intelligence determined that they were Arab peasants living in the area, who informed us that the Turks, taking advantage of the night, had abandoned everything and fled. The news of the Turkish flight caused us profound agony, for we wanted the enemy to continue face-to-face battle so we could satisfy our thirst for revenge more and more. The next morning we went up the mountain again and inspected the enemy trenches; which were filled with corpses and wounded. The ones who were not totally dead proved to be the most unfortunate. The memory of yesterday's genocide (the loss of our parents, children, sisters, brothers) was so fresh in our minds, the thirst for revenge was so profound in the hearts of the Armenian Legionnaires, that the wounded Turks found no mercy. They were finished off in their trenches. Thus, the fierce Turkish resistance was totally crushed, and the enemy withdrew in disarray towards the interior of the country. We interred our dead comrades with full military honors on the mountain, right at the location of the battlefield called Arara. While lowering them into their graves, we all in unison recited the HayrMer and implored God to bless their souls and illuminate their graves forever. After 10 days of rest, we were ordered to leave the area. On October 10, 1918, we arrived in Haifa where we spent four days and, on October 20, we arrived in Beirut (Lebanon). On November 21, the whole battalion was taken to Mt. Lebanon and, after 5 days of rest and recuperation among the Cedars of Lebanon, we returned to Beirut. On December 6, a navy ship took us from Beirut and, on December 8, we arrived in Alexandretta (now Iskenderun, Turkey). On December 19, 1918, we started marching towards Adana. After I crossing through several Turkish villages, such as Payas, Dort-Yol (the town of oranges) and Ersin, we arrived in Toprak Kaley. From Toprak Kaley we took the train and, as we approached Adana, we saw a large Armenian crowd, which had come to the railroad station to greet us. Their warmth and enthusiasm were beyond description. They were so delighted and excited to see triumphant Armenian soldiers at home that, with tears in their eyes, they welcomed and embraced us, as if we were God-sent heavenly angels. We spent the night at a Turkish hospital that formerly belonged to the Armenians. The next morning we took the train and, on December 25, 1918, we arrived in Misis; on February 7, 1919, we returned to Adana again, where we stayed until April 7. In the meantime, the Turkish officials were contemplating to bribe our officers and move us out of Adana. Finally, they succeeded in their plot and, on April 8, we moved to Ayram (a railroad station surrounded by huge mountains) where we established our military quarters and remained there until October 28. Having all our ammunition and provisions on our backs, we started marching for Marash, which was three days' walking distance. We spent the first night at Kazan-Ali where the Legionnaires slaughtered several cows and calves; all those Turks, who came and protested against this act, received a good beating and were sent off to their homes. We spent the second night at El-Oghli. There were no Armenian inhabitants in these two villages. On October 31, we crossed quite a long bridge on our way to Marash and stopped on the banks of the river for lunch and a short period of relaxation. After bathing and swimming, we continued our expedition and, within three hours, we were in Marash. The Armenians of Marash were lined up on both sides of the road, waving the French, British and Armenian flags to welcome us. A band in the center was playing the hymns of the Allies and Armenian national songs. Many of them, tears in their eyes, were embracing us; many of them, down on their knees, were kissing the ground and thanking God for this joyful day. Some of them followed us to our military quarters. On November 5, we left Marash for Ayntab (Aintab). After three days of long marches and crossing through several Turkish villages, we arrived in Ayntab and spent the night at the former American College for Armenian students. The next morning we were ordered to leave for Katma's military camp. Here our battalion was divided into several smaller groups and each group was assigned to a different railroad station. Our group was assigned to stay at the mosquito-infested Koort-Koolak Station, where many of us fell sick because of inclement weather and unhealthy water. On November 14, a train arrived from Aleppo, carrying the other battalion of Armenian Legionnaires. One of them got down from the wagon, approached me, introduced himself as Soghomon Gougassian from Perchenj. I am Perchenjtsis and my name is Hovhannes Garabedian, I replied. He said, There are some Perchenjtsis in the wagon. Would you like to come and meet them? We walked to the wagon where I met my Uncle Dado. We embraced, kissed each other, shed some tears and hardly exchanged a few words before the train started moving. I gave him two Turkish pounds, shook his hand and bid him farewell, hoping we would meet again within a few days. On December 10, 1919, the African black soldiers, under French command, replaced us and we returned again to Katma. Here I fell sick and, on December 23, the military doctor dispatched me by train to the military hospital in Adana. While in the hospital, I received the happy news that the big powers had officially recognized the Independent Republic of Armenia. Three days after this joyful event, word came that the 25,000 Armenian inhabitants of Marash had, once more, been subjected to massacres and deportations by the Turks. Suddenly, the days of excitement and happiness were replaced by long days of sorrow and mourning. In order to make room for the recently wounded and partially frozen Armenians from Marash, I was transferred to the hospital in Tarsus [Tarsonj on February 20, 1920. On March 4,1 was discharged and, the same day, took the train for Adana. On March 14, I renewed my military service with the 13th brigade as the coachman of Captain Genovese, who was the former commander of the 5th brigade. Early in the morning of April 11, Easter Sunday, I left the camp for a short walk and fresh air. When I returned about an hour later, Captain Genovese was standing at the gate and looked very furious. After the military salute, I was ordered to go directly to the stockade for 8 days, for not being present at the military camp when needed. While all the Christians of the world were celebrating the Resurrection of Christ, the unlucky and unfortunate Armenians were suffering unprecedented genocide. As for me, I was sitting behind the stockade walls for the pleasure of a merciless officer. What an injustice! How long will it continue? On May 10, 1920, Turkish brigands started operating around Adana and were harassing, robbing and murdering Armenians, who had by the grace of God survived the genocide and had just returned to their homes. No one was safe, even in the city. On August 7, a brigade under the French command was given the task of opening the highway to Mersin, and we were given the responsibility of cleansing Adana and its suburbs of marauding Turkish bandits. Within a few days, law and order was restored. During this short operation, the Armenian soldiers were advised not to advance beyond the suburbs of Adana, but only to destroy the strongholds of Turkish brigands in the area. On August 27, Turkish bandits renewed their shelling of our military compound, the new railroad station and the general's residence. An immediate order was issued to silence the Turkish guns. At 2 a.m. our brigade was dispatched to Koort Depe where the enemy cannons were located. At 5 a.m., the French artillery opened heavy fire from the rear aimed at Turkish positions. By noontime, the enemy abandoned its fortifications, leaving behind some casualties (German-made 105mm cannons) and a large quantity of light weapons and ammunition. After this victorious operation, we returned to our barracks. The captured cannons were placed in front of the general's residence. The cavalry that was pursuing the fleeing Turks received orders to return to their quarters in Adana. Finally, on September 8, 1920, we received our discharge certificates from the military service, and the following day we abandoned our military uniforms and once again we put on civilian clothes with many, many thanks for surviving to this grateful day.

"Headnote Legate's Committee member in meeting at State Department WASHINTON, DC - Vartkess Balian, a member of the Legate's Committee, represented the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America during a recent gathering of religious leaders at the U.S. State Department here. Christian, Jewish, and Muslim leaders, representing 25 national organizations, met with Karen Hughes, undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs, on Tuesday, February 28, 2006. The meeting was part of an organizational appeal urging President Bush to make Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority for U.S. policy. During the meeting, the religious leaders expressed the desire to see continued humanitarian aid to the Palestinians, while agreeing with President Bush's insistence that Hamas, the newly elected leaders of the Palestinian Authority, reject violence and recognize Israel. They specifically asked the Bush administration to press for an immediate and comprehensive cease-fire, work to assure that the agreement on Gaza is fully implemented, press both sides to implement their initial Road Map obligations, and appoint an on-the-ground envoy to manage and monitor negotiations. The gathering was organized by National Interreligious Leadership Initiative for Peace in the Middle East, which was founded in 2003. In a statement on the meeting, organizers said that they believe achieving peace in Jerusalem and the Holy Land is not only essential for Israelis and Palestinians, but for reducing the threat of global terrorism and easing tensions among religious communities worldwide. The Diocesan Legate's Committee, of which Balian is a member, is an advisory board that works with Bishop Vicken Aykazian, legate and ecumenical officer, to promote the ecumenical and interfaith efforts of the Diocese. It is important that our legate and the Legate's Committee continue taking an active interest in the status of the Holy Land, said Archbishop Khajag Barsamian, Primate. As both Christians and Armenians, we have a strong historical tie to the Holy Land. It is vital that our voice be heard in Washington, the United Nations, and around the world, for we are also stakeholders in the lasting future of the Holy Land.",Anonymous,Armenian Reporter International,2006-03-25,1
"NEW YORK, NY - It was a monumental turning point 1,600 years ago when the Armenian alphabet was created. We feel its repercussions still today, as Armenians continue to build on its legacy in great and small ways. On Thursday, February 16, 2006, a panel of experts discussed this legacy of the Armenian alphabet. Hosted by the Krikor and Clara Zohrab Information Center of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church, the discussion was held before an audience of 200 at the Diocesan Center in New York City. In introducing the speakers, Aram Arkun, coordinator of the Zohrab Center, expressed hopes that the global commemorations marking the 1600th anniversary of the creation of the alphabet would pave the way for new major milestones in Armenian literature and culture. A VEHICLE OF ARMENIAN LITERARY CULTURE Dr. Seta Dadoyan, author of five books and currently the Nikit and Eleanoru Ordjanian visiting professor at Columbia University, focused her remarks on the Armenian alphabet's political dimensions, saying the alphabet served as a nexus for Armenian national pride, religious faith, and cultural exertions. In a carefully researched lecture, Dr. Dadoyan called the alphabet's inventor. St. Mesrob Mashdots, an icon symbolizing the alphabet, stressing that his work must be understood in historic context. She proposed that the invention of the script was directly related to the circumstances of Armenians between the 4th and 7th centuries, and important to a later phase when Armenia was under direct Arab rule. She referred to this period as the vital phase of the Armenian people's formation in cultural-political terms. The alphabet was a vehicle and provided a platform for Armenian literary culture. More importantly, it was instrumental in generating the ideologies of the church and the state, she said. Following the adoption of Christianity, the Armenian people faced massive pressures towards total assimilation, from both the West (the Roman and Byzantine empires) and the East (Iran and later Islam). The conversion of the Armenians to Christianity was a very lengthy process that had already started during the first century AD, and continued through the Middle Ages. With the conversion of the Armenian and Georgian kings, Christianity immediately gained great political significance regionally. Eventually, the socialpolitical power of Christianity was to be deployed not only against Iran, but also against Rome itself. From the beginning, Armenian Christianity was a Westernizing factor against the East, which was Syriac and Persian, then Muslim, she said. Following the two universal councils which defined Christianity - Nicea in 325, and Constantinople in 381 - the invention of the script became a political measure, a force to be deployed wherever necessary, she explained. With Eastern Armenia in danger of slipping into paganism and Zoroastrianism. Sahak and Mesrop had to find solutions, she said. The invention of the Armenian script and the deepening of Armenian literature and faith were interlocked, she noted. The immediate objective of the script was the creation of a Christian literature, to assist and consolidate the missionary work of the church. The Bible was the first full text to be translated, followed by the first phase of translating religious texts. The 5th century became the Golden Age of Armenian Literature. The 45 years between the invention of the alphabet and the Battle of Avarayr in 451 were marked by the removal of the Armenian Arsacid/Arshakuni dynasty by Iran in 428 at the request of the Armenian feudal lords (or nakharars), as well as the initial development of Armenian literature. This period ended with the Council of Chalcedon in 451 - which the Armenians eventually rejected, resulting in a separation between the Western and Armenian churches - and the Battle of Avarayr in 451, which produced Armenian martyrs and saints. Because of this battle, the Armenian Church seemed to adopt a favorable attitude to war as a struggle against evil, she stated. Avarayr was a conscious choice of death as the way to immortality. Avarayr was loyalty to the ancestral values of the Armenian people, Dr. Dadoyan said, noting that it completed a 150-year process of defining the people. The alphabet had Armenized Christianity, the church, and cultural politics. The legacy of this process was a fundamental formula of loyalties to faith, language, and ancestral values. Herein lay the political dimensions of the invention of the alphabet. THE ALPHABET'S MAGICAL MYSTERY Dr. Roberta Ervine, associate professor of Armenian studies at St. Nersess Armenian Seminary, used her extensive knowledge of the Armenian language, to focus on how Mesrob's Magical Mystery Alphabet was perceived by Armenians in the Middle Ages. Mashdots invented the script for Armenians in order to give them the ability to embody their thoughts, to incarnate meaning, to preserve, to pass down the invisible in visible form, to have meaning in and of itself, she stated in her inspiring talk. Mesrob consciously set out to create an alphabet far superior to that of Hebrew or Greek. He created a totally Christian alphabet. There had to be 36 letters, she continued, because letters in antiquity were also used as numbers for arithmetical computation. The numbers were so important. They are the invisible mystery that allows us to express the invisible realities of the universe. Also every letter had assigned to it the number that corresponded to its place in the alphabet, she explained, demonstrating these ideas with slides. Mesrob Mashdots' alphabet had meaning, mystery, power, and a connection to the divine. It is an alphabet that lives. Every time you use those letters, you affirm whom you are, who God is. You make yourself a vehicle for the embodiment of the divine in a visible way, a line of unbroken communication from God's eternal finger to the pen of every Armenian writer who has or will ever use those immortal letters, Dr. Ervine poetically concluded. RADICAL CHANGES IN ARMENIAN LANGUAGE Dr. Marc Nichanian, a visiting professor of Armenian studies at Columbia University, centered his address on the question, What is a literary language? He also tackled the provocative issue of whether spoken Armenian had Eastern and Western dialects at the time of the alphabet's invention. The language became literary at least twice in Armenian history, first in the 5th century and later in the middle of the 19th century. He first tackled the era of the 19th century when Western Armenian was fully formed, approximately the way we are using it today, not entirely uniform, full of Turkish idioms, but nevertheless in use. He pointed out that, between 1792 and 1843, hundreds of books were published in Venice and Constantinople in this fully formed Western Armenian, but this does not mean that it was already a literary language. It was precisely what the contemporaries called a civil language: the language of communication in schools, the language of teaching and learning, the language of an elite of merchants and city dwellers, the language of courts. It was in 1843 that the Mekhitarist fathers recognized that their dream of reviving Classical Armenian (krapar) as a common language of Armenians would not become a reality. The difference between a civil and literary language, Dr. Nichanian continued, is that the civil language (ashkharapar), in this case Western Armenian, had become the common language of all Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, spread through journals, schools, theater, and preaching. It had become a common language, the language of reference for everybody, supplanting krapar. The literary language of the 19th century developed as a reaction to the spread of a civil language, and to fill the void left by the submergence of krapar. Linguists have argued that, unlike the situation in the 19th century, there could not have existed dialects in the language spoken by Armenians in the 5th century. The problem is that there is no evidence as to when the shift in pronunciation of consonants that differentiates Western and Eastern Armenian today actually took place. All we know is that it already existed by the 12th century in Cilicia. However, some argue that dialectological work shows that this distinction existed already in the 5th century. Some experts believe that Mesrob Mashdots' true genius was not to create an alphabet in which each letter represented a separate sound or phoneme, but to create an alphabet in which each letter could represent a different sound in a different dialect. The same word would have been pronounced differently, in different regions, but would maintain a uniform spelling for all Armenian speakers. However, Nichanian pointed out that this is only a hypothesis, and most people still believe that Mashdots analyzed and transcribed the language spoken on the plain of Ararat. Nichanian concluded his talk by noting that, in the 5th century, as in the 19th, a group of writers, translators, and preachers convinced the populace to adopt a language that has gone through literarization as its own, sometimes through teaching, but sometimes necessarily also through the use of force. Along with producing such panels, the Diocese's Zohrab Information Center's mission is to help disseminate a greater understanding of the Armenian people to academics, researchers, the media, and the community at large.

"Skeptics around the world proclaim that the dismissal of charges against Orhan Pamuk by the Turkish court system means very little. Those people who want to see the best side of Turkey, regardless of the facts, attest that the action not to prosecute Mr. Pamuk is another indication that Turkey is heading on a one-way street to full democracy. It is probably closer to the truth not to go overboard in either direction. The dismissal of the case does mean one thing for sure: those people who maintain that Turkey cannot be pressured into going in any direction it does not want to go are incorrect. There is clear evidence that the Turkish courts wanted to hear the case out and the prosecutor wanted to throw the book at Mr. Pamuk. But, Mr. Pamuk, already a well-known novelist and citizen of Turkey, became a cause celebre when it was announced that he had violated Article 301 of the revised penal codes and that he would be tried for insulting Turkishness. CODES OPEN TO WIDE INTERPRETATION As is common with Turkish law, the codes are so loosely written that the authorities can interpret them in the manner best suited to assist the state. Turkish laws are not about Western ideas of justice. The state is the center of mass, and everything else revolves around it. Turkey still represents Kemal Ataturk's sun-god theory. The penal codes are new in the sense that that were recently written and revised. The laws were supposed to abide by the spirit of the meanings that would boost Turkey into the European Union. Once the Pamuk case became known, the Europeans, in particular, reacted with clear warnings to Turkey that, should Mr. Pamuk be tried and go to jail, Turkey's chances for becoming a member of the EU would be placed in jeopardy. Numerous European leaders made comments, with one person even stating that Turkey was on trial, not Mr. Pamuk. Europeans went to Turkey, determined to sit in on the trial. As it is, the paranoid Turkish authorities and former officials such as Gunduz Aktan continue to insist that Europeans are against Turks and do not want them in their Christian club because Turkey is a Muslim state. People like Aktan do not conduct a self-appraisal of Turkey according to European standards; they conduct evaluations in keeping with their understanding of what Kemal Pasha wanted and dreamed of for the state. They do not want to understand that European, and not Turkish, standards will carry the day for entry into the EU. THREAT OF JAIL DISSUADES MANY Indeed, Mr. Pamuk did not go to jail or even to court. But the threat was enough to change the actions of many Turks who might wish to stray from the government party line. Do not think for one minute that Turkish citizens do not understand that their fate might be totally different from Orhan Pamuk's because they are not world-renowned celebrities. Should Europe and the free world really celebrate that Mr. Pamuk was set free? Yes, because of his human rights, but they must use restraint. The dismissal of his case does not equate to a sudden change in the general Turkish thinking (official and otherwise). Have another person make the comments, and throngs of people are still prone to gather around him/her and shout traitor. The demand for the person's head who is thought to have insulted Turkishness will be as strong as ever. There has been no overnight cultural transformation. Ismet Berkan, Murat Beige, Erol Katircioglu, Hasan Cemil and Haluk Sahin are still scheduled for trial. The charges stem from the same subject as with Mr. Pamuk. This time, the five journalists are charged with insulting the judiciary and attempting to influence the course of justice (what a misnomer for Turkey) due to articles they wrote criticizing the court decision to initially ban the conference in September on the Genocide. If found guilty, each person could receive between six months and 10 years in prison. Mr. Cemil of the Milliyet (newspaper) naively thought that his country's leaders actually espouse freedom of expression as practiced in democratic countries. He stated, I did nothing but enjoy my right to freedom of expression by saying the...conference was necessary and that the court was hampering the proper functioning of democracy. Then the journalist had the audacity to call upon the government for a change of mentality in the court systems by encouraging the judges to follow the guidelines outlined by the European Court of human Rights. THE COURAGEOUS WARRIOR HRANT DINK Hrant Dink drew a six-month prison sentence (suspended) in October, Emin Karaca was fined with a prison sentence of five months, and Zulkuf Kisanak received five months in jail, but that was reduced to a fine of $1,870. These Turkish citizens are among more than 60 writers and publishers to face charges under Article 301, the Draconian law that upholds Turkishness. Our friend Hrant Dink, the Bolsahye who apparently lived in a dream fashioned by a myth, the editor of Argos, the only Turkish - and Armenian-language newspaper in Turkey, recently commented that he felt hurt that the courts sentenced him to six months. At the time he said that he would leave the country if the courts did not overturn his conviction. Mr. Dink still faces charges for attempting to influence the courts because of remarks that he made in a conference in Urfa. In December 2005, he and two Argos writers were also charged by the Turkish Union of Lawyers with more insults against the state. Depending on what the court decides, the Armenians could get six years in a Turkish prison. One would think that a person of Armenian heritage living in Turkey would be immune to remark making such as, I know what you can and cannot do here...I thought I knew this country well, but this ruling took me by surprise. One would also assume that Turkish citizens, regardless of ethnicity, are Turks, albeit with a different brand than ethnic Turks, but Turks nevertheless. Mr. Dink goes on to say that he did not insult Turkishness or Turkish identity; it's not my job to criticize the Turkish identity, that's up to the Turks. Mr. Dink is mortified that he was found guilty of racism: How can this be? All my life I have struggled against ethnic discrimination and racism. Ankara may be forcing Hrant Dink to leave Turkey, my country of three thousand years. (Oh yes, I know that I do not live there, thank God. But one does not have to stick one's hand into fire to know that it hurts). Surely, the EU understands that letting Mr. Pamuk or a number of journalists escape imprisonment, without drastic changes in law and the cultural underpinnings that even allowed such a law as Article 301 to be written, means very little in the big picture. The EU has to apply more pressure, and hopefully within ten years there may be a cultural renaissance in Turkey that allows the state and its people to resemble Europe and its democratic foundations.

The host of the program, Kitty Felde, opened the program with Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who spoke about the state of the city and how Angelinos are getting along. From my vantage point, when you look at this city, it's the city where the world comes together; a city where we speak 130 languages; where we have some 30 different nationalities that have the largest population here outside of their country of origin, commented Mayor Villaraigosa. While recognizing certain conflicts, Mayor Villaraigosa stated that you also see many examples of people working together, people reaching across racial and ethnic and class lines to better understand one another and to work to improve communities. The program tackled issues such as racism and other trouble spots faced by LA's diverse ethnic makeup. ANCA-WR Chairman Steven Dadaian, who was one of the forum's panelists and representing die Armenian community, stated that there really is a hidden wealth in this community we have here, this multicultural experiment going on in Southern California. During the show, one of the issues discussed was the situation with growing tensions in LAUSD schools. Dadaian pointed out during the discussion that the core of the problem in schools is not necessarily racism, rather that the problem we're seeing is that we don't have the level of sensitivity in the schools to try to help these young people integrate. Later in the program, Dadaian pointed out that part of understanding each other is about everyone showing concern about injustices that have been committed against one group or another, such as the Armenian Genocide or other genocides. He cited an example of how the ANCA is leading efforts raising awareness about the genocide in Darfur. Dadajan stated, The Armenian National Committee is heading up the group that is going to be doing that [demonstrating in front of the White House] because we know what it's like. We cannot sit by when our brother is persecuted. It's everyone's responsibly to make sure there is justice for everyone. In addition to the ANCA, the panel also included Rabbi Allen Freehling, Executive Director of the LA Human Relations Commission; Antonia Hernandez, President and CEO of the California Community Foundation; Cookie Lommel, Founder of Operation Unity and Executive Director of the Jewish Labor Committee Western Region; Sireen Sawaf of the Hate Crimes Prevention Department of the Muslim Public Affairs Council; and Kara Inae Carlisle, Director of Public Affairs and Community Relations for the Korean American Coalition. Participation in this special radio show is one of several initiatives the ANCA-WR is pursuing to elevate awareness of the Armenian community in Los Angeles, in addition to building bridges with other communities and the leadership of the city.
