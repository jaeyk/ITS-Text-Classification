# Data availability and social science research 

![](https://axispraxis.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/muttjeff01.jpg?w=800)

The streetlight effect: **data availability** constrains the **scope** of research **questions** and **methods**.

# Quantitative research on marginalized populations 

It's *relatively* easy to assess how majority groups are biased against minority groups, but it's difficult to investigate how minority groups experience and internalize bias using quantitative methods.  

---

# Current options and their limitations 

1. Qualitative research: generalizability
2. Survey research: temporal scope and group heterogeneity
3. Experimental research: snapshots and artificial treatments
  
---

# Takeaways 

1. Machine learning enables data-intensive research on marginalized populations. (You can think of a prediction as part of the complex research design.)

2. Automating research process helps increase research transparency, reproducibility, and scalability.

# Ethnic newspaper as an alternative data source

# Data sources 

Data source: Ethnic NewsWatch database (2.5 million + articles collected over the last four decades)

Raw data: 1,132 Arab and 4,552 Indian American newspaper articles mentioning Muslims published between 1996 and 2006

---

# Outcome measures and hypotheses

Among the Muslim related articles:

* Domestic politics

* International politics

---

# Argument 

If threats encourage information seeking (Valentino et al. 2008; Albertson and Gadarian 2015) and information seeking increases the demand for news reports on these threats, then ... 

---

# Argument 

H1: The September 11 attacks made Arab American and Indian American newspapers publish more articles on U.S. political news related to Muslim communities in the post-9/11 period than in previous years. (**TRUE**)

---

# Argument 

H2: Arab American and Indian American newspapers published more articles on Muslim populations outside than inside the U.S. in the post-9/11 period than in the pre-intervention period. (**FALSE**)
