3. Randomly sampling articles from the corpus in R **COMPLETE**
4. Labeling the sample articles (manually done) **COMPLETE**
5. Classifying articles in Python (e.g., scikit-learn) **IN PROGRESS**
6. Estimating the causal effect in R **IN PROGRESS**

## Collaborators 
I worked with three highly competent UC Berkeley ungergraduates for this project (Sarah, Vivek, and Carlos). 

I am project lead and Andrew Thompson (a predoctoral fellow in Political Science at MIT and a PhD candidate in Political Science at Northwestern) is co-author of the paper based on this project. The paper is scheduled to present at the upcoming Western Political Science Association annual meeting. 

## Institutional support 
This project was supported by [the Data Science Discovery Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery) at UC Berkley (Fall 2019).
