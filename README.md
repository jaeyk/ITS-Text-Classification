# ITD-Text-Classification
Combining Interrupted Time Series Design and Text Classification to Study How Threats Shape Immigrant Communities' Interest in US Domestic Politics. The intent of the project is to demonstate how machine learning (i.e. text classification) can be used to provide data for causal inference. 

I worked with three highly competent UC Berkeley ungergraduates for this project (Sarah, Vivek, and Carlos). 

I am project lead and Andrew Thompson (predoctoral fellow in Political Science at MIT) is a co-author of the paper based on this project.

This project was supported by [the Data Science Discovery Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery) at UC Berkley (Fall 2019).
