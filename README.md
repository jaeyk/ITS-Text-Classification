# ITD-Text-Classification

## Purpose 

Combining Interrupted Time Series Design and Text Classification to Study How Threats Shape Immigrant Communities' Interest in US Domestic Politics. The intent of the project is to demonstate how machine learning (i.e. text classification) can be used to provide data for causal inference. 

## Abstract 

## Workflow 

0. Collecting Muslim-related articles from Arab- and Indian-American newspapers using Ethnic Watch database (manually done due to legal restrictions)
1. Parsing original HTML files into CSV files using beautiful soup in Python 
2. Randomly sampling articles from the corpus in R
3. Classifying articles using the sample articles in Python 
4. Estimating the causal effect in R

## Collaborators 
I worked with three highly competent UC Berkeley ungergraduates for this project (Sarah, Vivek, and Carlos). 

I am project lead and Andrew Thompson (a predoctoral fellow in Political Science at MIT and a PhD candidate in Political Science at Northwestern) is co-author of the paper based on this project. The paper is scheduled to present at the upcoming Western Political Science Association annual meeting. 

## Institutional support 
This project was supported by [the Data Science Discovery Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery) at UC Berkley (Fall 2019).
