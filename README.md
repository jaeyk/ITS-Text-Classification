# ITD-Text-Classification
Combining Interrupted Time Series Design and Text Classification to Study How Threats Shape Immigrant Communities' Interest in US Domestic Politics. The intent of the project is to demonstate how machine learning can be used to provide data for causal inference. 

I worked with three highly competent UC Berkeley ungergraduates for this project (Sarah, Vivek, and Carlos). 

This project was supported by [the Data Science Discovery Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/research/discovery) at UC Berkley (Fall 2019).
